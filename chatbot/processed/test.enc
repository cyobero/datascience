Unsolved mystery.  She used to be really popular when she started high school, then it was just like she got sick of it or something.
C'esc ma tete. This is my head
I don't want to know how to say that though.  I want to know useful things. Like where the good stores are.  How much does champagne cost?  Stuff like Chat.  I have never in my life had to point out my head to someone.
I was?
Me.  This endless ...blonde babble. I'm like, boring myself.
Wow
No.
Great
You think you ' re the only sophomore at the prom?
It means that Gigglepuss is playing at Club Skunk and we're going.
After that, I swore I'd never do anything just because "everyone else" was doing it.  And I haven't since. Except for Bogey's party, and my stunning gastro-intestinal display --
Not all experiences are good, Bianca. You can't always trust the people you want to.
Is that woman a complete fruit-loop or is it just me?
No! You're not dating until your sister starts dating.  End of discussion.
Otherwise known as an orgy?
I'm missing something.
Fan of a fan.  You see a couple of minors come in?
So they tell me...
North, actually.  How'd you   ?
How many people go here?
Why not?
Sure do ... my Mom's from Canada
They always let felons sit in on Honors Biology?
I thought you hated those people.
It's a lung cancer issue
The vintage look is over, Kat. Haven't you been reading your Sassy?
Forget it.
I hear you're helpin' Verona.
You better not fuck this up.  I'm heavily invested.
You didn't
Well, I guess we're not, since we don't have dates .
Then say you'll spend Dollar Night at the track with me.
I was in the laundromat. I saw your car. Thought I'd say hi.
You're not okay.
I just need to lie down for awhile
Why?
Then why'd you ask?
Do what?
My father wouldn't approve of that that
Oh, so now you think you know me?
He left!  I sprung the dickhead and he cruised on me.
C'mon.  It's not that bad
I don't like to do what people expect. Then they expect it all the time and they get disappointed when you change.
Then you screwed up
Is that a request or a command?
Oh huh
A Fender Strat. You bought this?
Expressing my opinion is not a terrorist action.
Macbeth, right?
What?
The situation is, my man Cameron here has a major jones for Bianca Stratford.
Are you telling me I'm a -  "non-smoker"?
Touch of the flu.
What's to discuss?
Jesus!  Can a man even grab a sandwich before you women start dilating?
What do you wanna watch?  We've got crap, crap, crap or crap
Absolutely not.
I never seen heat like this!  Not even in Las Minas!
Ah, leave him alone.  He's doing no harm.
I could be gone for years.
I don't want you to wait for me.
God... you're so beautiful!  I can't believe no other man has ever taken you away from me...
Forgive me, Don Bobadilla -- those positions have already been taken.
May I ask by whom?
My letters of appointment.
Do you swear on all the Holy Saints in heaven?
I remind you, Senor Colon, that you are in no position to bargain with me.
Roofs... towers, palaces... spires...
Utapan, won't you speak to me?  You used to know how to speak to me.
That's what it says.
I'll try to remember that, Marchena...
You get so carried away when you are being contradicted!
I've been contradicted all my life... Eternity!
New worlds create new people.
We don't need to know.
We can't raise the wheel without it.
Savagery is what monkeys understand.
Due west, Captain Mendez.  And may God be with us...
We're on the verge of a mutiny, Colon!
We're lost!
And then what?  Half of the water has gone, the rest is nearly putrid! You know that!
Is that the man I knew, Treasurer Sanchez?
Every ship returns with a cargo of sick and dying.  But with no gold! The new world proves expensive, Your Majesty.
I was all of these.
Don't worry about him.  Think about yourself.
...so we kill someone famous and if we are caught, we are sent to mental hospital...
You considered becoming a prostitute?
Did you ever turn tricks before?
No.
So you were never a prostitute?
They're not gonna send you right back.
If I was your boyfriend, I might be.
...Do you really want me to forget about you?
It was my decision, not his.
Well, I'm the Deputy Chief Fire Marshall and every now and then I'd like to be included in decisions.
Chief - mind if I take her?
Forgot?  You handcuffed a civilian to a tree?!
I said, yeah, you're right, Chief.  As soon as we get somethin' we'll let you alert the media.
Where is she?
Any I.D.?
Yeah.  He wanted a girl from Czechoslovakia, but I sent him Honey 'cause once they get there, you know, it doesn't really matter - Honey was killed...?  Poor girl...
What would you call her?
So am I.  Alright, I'll go inside and you cover the back.
Yeah.
Look, Eddie, I'm tellin' you - I didn't touch her.
Your opinion.  You see, they going to make a movie about me, too, Eddie.  And write books.
I kill someone famous.
You really think you'll be able to fool a jury with this bullshit?  How fuckin' stupid are you?
Can we go up to the crime scene?
He was hurt, but not seriously.  He'll be fine.
Alright.
Alright?
Alright.
Stop it.
Alright, alright, Eddie.  Don't patronize me.
Yeah.
Yeah, yeah.  Good thing.
I hope this prick doesn't run.  My knees are killing me.  Stay behind me.
I'll meet you on one condition - I get exclusivity and you surrender to me.
My father was.  He gave me many lessons about fire.  Now it's my friend.
You can't kill me.  You're not a cop. Just fireman with a gun.  I bet you never shot anybody in your life.
I like to talk to the person who runs the service.  Can you give me address?
Two weeks holiday.
How much money are you carrying with you?
Is he with you?  Are you travelling together?
Please join us.  Come on forward.
Do you know how much killer gets for movie rights?
Gotta light the scene better.  Now it's more moody... like a scene from THE THIRD MAN.
What is that?
You got that?
Take your eyes off her, Oleg!  Look.  It wasn't my fault you two were caught.  It's his fault.  Trying to get the bank clerk's phone number?!  I wasn't going to wait!!!
Yes...he's my friend.
He's my collar!
Don't you get it?  He knew he was gonna get caught!  That's why he videotaped Eddie's murder - he thinks he's gonna get off.
Look, I'm in here.  You call this a career move?
Right. Just a sec.
How?
Yes, I know.
Too bad about Frank, isn't it?
Yes, it is.
She's in the bathroom.
Okay, sweetheart. Well, I have to go now. Tell Mommy that I called.
Yes... Well, I hope the crew got back safely.
But you don't have any idea as to what it is?
Right. Hal, tell me whether the following statements are true or false.
I will if I can, Frank.
That's true
Hal, maintain normal E.V.A. condition.
I don't give a damn about his girl...
Excuse me, baby, but if i don't get some action tonight, I'm gonna bust.  You interested?
What's the matter with my place?
Hey, don't do that.  I said I wasn't a pro, remember?
Would you guys...
You and the other one, you're still Billy's girls. You always were his girls...
What's the big deal about you bein' on the street?
Don't worry, I got a move for ya. An awesome move. A guy named Luther. Ganz'll be paying him a visit.  We go to him right away.
What gang you talkin' about, Jack?
Hey, this works pretty good.
Now, where we goin', convict?
You?  Don't make me laugh.  You can't take care of shit.  You've been dicking me around since we started on this turd-hunt.  All you're good for is games... So far, what I got outta you is nothin'...
Yeah, right.  You want to try again?
You gonna let me keep any of it?
Get this. We ain't partners. We ain't brothers. We ain't friends. If Ganz gets away with my money, you're gonna be sorry we ever met.
Musta got some primo bondsman.
Jesus Christ, look at all the dust on my car...why in the hell don't he take it to a car wash?
You'd think the guy'd be smart enough to know he was being tailed.
You know, I'd be embarrassed if I let my wheels go the way you've done with this job.
No class...
We're getting too close ... Cates, what's the matter, you been takin' dumb pills?
That was in style a couple years back, man.
Maybe we should pay Luther a visit.
Why?
I had it impounded.  Come on, we'll use it for haulin' you back to the slam.
Sure, I'll give you a shot at it, but Ganz is mine.  You know, that big Indian plays it for keeps...
Wait a minute, Cates.  I've been waitin' three years for that.  I don't think it's fair, man. What about the merit system.? You were gonnna give me a few thousand.
You are an awesomely weird cop. Sure wish there were more like you runnin' around out here.
Thanks.
I want to be left alone on this one. Algren was killed with my gun.
Jack?
Yeah?
But that's what you say about all of us all the tine ... we're always the ones fucking up when you tell it...
Are you gonna tell me about police procedure?  Do me a favor, don't give me a bunch of crap.
Billy Bear...
Wait a minute, wait a minute... who's this?
Bullshit red tape.
I got to wait for a call.
He ... he wants me to help him skip town.
When? How?
What'd you do?
Maybe I got a fairly crummy day ahead.
Maybe that makes a nice excuse.
You know something, Jack, you really are hopeless.
Bullshit?  I'll tell you about bullshit.  My gun's a real weapon in the hands of a real maniac who knows how to use it.  It isn't my macho bullshit that's killing people, my gun is ...
Just one.  Some lady called.  Said she's a little hot-headed sometimes... But she still wants her occasional roommate. She'd like to talk it over after she gets off work tonight... if it's humanly possible....
Don't.  We've had a hard night.
It might pay to reexamine a few of your more primitive notions.  I was in bed with a girlfriend watching TV last week, Jack, and one thing we know about me is I happen not to be a lesbian ... Now, if this Indian's girlfriend got upset when you came looking for him, it could just be she's still vulnerable to him.
Who the hell are you?
How would you know?
You want to go outside?
How much?
Yeah, I know that, but this is me and we're old friends. I haven't got the money so what are you gonna do about it?
Fuck you.  You got no right for this kind of play.
Personally, they are of no interest to me, I'd rather sell weapons..but I have a customer... so tell me...
...I'm a priest! I'm here to serve life, All you want to do is destroy it.
He's a she!
So you do know her.
She's an exception..
It means, "Never without my permission".
What kind of mission?
We have to save the world.
Don't tell me you don't know how all this works?
But what happens if instead of this... Ultimate Warrior... it is EVIL who stands here?
...Priest...
Vito... Cor... Ni-lious... Priest...
...What's your name?
Have you pulled yourself together?
Welcome on board Mr. Dallas..
I'm sorry..
30 seconds...
6... 5...
My main man! Please don't leave me here alone. My head's killing me and my adoring fans are gonna tear me apart! Get me outta here!
I thought you were divorced.
You hear that?
Dinoine chagantakat!
Which one?
You can sleep tomorrow... come on...
What's the use of saving lives... when you see what you do with them!
Yes, you do! I need you. More than you can imagine! Stand up straight!
Not going to open?
Been here long?
Is that better?
Yes, Mr. Zorg, I hear you perfectly! So, how was the concert?
Who gives a shit! I didn't come here to listen to music! Listen up instead of running off at the mouth! The batteries on my phone are almost gone.
You better not be smoking, that's all I can say.
You think you'll have time for the water heater this weekend?
Hello?
I wanted to call.  I couldn't.
Amy, I'm not going to let anything happen to us.
She's all I've got.  She's the only witness.
You know where I can get it?  I have a lot of money to spend.
That's five thousand dollars.
Is it?
I want to watch you work.
I'd rather you didn't.
Empty the gun onto the table, very carefully.
You're a dead man.
Leave him alone.
What can I do for you, Mr. Welles?
They were pretty clear they didn't want this coming back on them.
You murdered that girl, Eddie.  Six years ago...
That's all?  Thirty each.  That's all it took for you to murder her?
So... you brought Dino in, and he brought Machine.  And, one day, a girl walked into your office because you had an ad in the paper for models.  And she never walked out.
Something like that.
Where?  Show me where.
Do it!  Put me out of my misery so I don't have to listen to you whining anymore.  You think it's so easy?
Easy enough for you.
I'm listening.
Must have paid you a lot, for you to risk everything.  Would've had to have cut yourself a real nice piece of money.
Enlighten me.
Can I interest you in a battery operated-vagina?
I tear off the cover and paste this one on...  You know how it is.
How long you been working there?
You're a private eye.  Like Shaft.
How much do you make now?
Okay, let's pretend I live in the same fantasy world where you make four hundred a week in that dump. I'll give you six hundred for a few days.
Here's my number if you need it...  When can you start?
There's two kinds of specialty product; legal and illegal.  Foot fetish, shit films, watersports, bondage, spanking, fisting, she- males, hemaphrodites... it's beyond hardcore, but legal.  This is the kind of hardcore where one guy's going to look at it and throw up, another guy looks at it and falls in love.  Now, with some of the S+M and bondage films, they straddle the line.  How are you supposed to tell if the person tied up with the ball gag in their mouth is a consenting or not?  Step over that line, you're into kiddie porn.  Rape films, but there aren't many.  I've never seen one.
I don't know, where are yours?
What about me?
I'm a working stiff, pops.
Who is he, his name?
I've been privileged to provide services for people I admire.
Mostly.  That's where he started his empire building.  He was a good man.  Notorious as an eccentric, but that was something he cultivated.  He wanted to be legendary.
I didn't know what to think.  I can't tell you how horrible it's been, to know this belonged to my husband.  To know that he watched this... this atrocity.  But, I can't go to the police...
I'm sure it is.  It's probably something your husband was given as a bad joke.  More than likely he never even watched it.
No.  For me to live with the ruin of my husband's name, I need know that whoever did this will be punished. If you can find them, I will take their names to the police.  I'll say my husband confessed on his death bed. I'll say I didn't have courage to come forward at first...
It won't work like that.
Okay, I follow you so far...
Send it to me through the post office like we arranged.  No return address.  You dug this up all by yourself?
It got to be too much for him.
People remember me from the news.  Can you drive me back now?
Are you religious?
Do you think the police did a good job?
I don't know.  I think so.
You were right.  I didn't find anything.  I'm going to run and get something to eat. Are you hungry?
Do you know what happened to her?
Don't you think it kind of defeats the purpose?
I can't go back to sleep again.
We'll figure it out.
No really, it's a fable.  The 'guardian of good' dreams.  It was like my teddy bear when I was growing up.
We have matching luggage.
You've been up all night?
You're his sister, right?
Tell him I was looking for him, okay?  I'm Dan.
Hey, you're not alone.  We have to stop him, I'm with you.
Asthma attack...what 17-year old has a fatal asthma attack?  She was gonna be a doctor.
Enough of that crap.
Something the matter with the cuisine?
I though Freddy was just an old town story.
Excuse us, dear.
But how...?
Nothing...it's just...I didn't see my father at the ceremony.
You don't dream him up, he can't hurt you.  Or me.  Or us.  Remember...
That's in the past.  Unless you've stopped going to the meetings.
How was the meeting?
Alice!
What's that got to do with it?
What?
But how are we gonna --
Tell me some more about this Krueger guy.
I don't understand.
It's okay.
You 'trade school boys' are all alike, aren't you?  Anybody who doesn't happen to think like a little gold-braided puppet is, ipso facto, a coward!
That may be.  But Dad stays where <u>he</u> is, and I'm staying here!
But if they <u>do</u>?
Reef!
Cyclops?
What's more important - there's our problem.  The bow ram - the sawteeth are holding the Shark in the break. If we can cut the ram, the Shark can pull herself loose!
You hear that?
Seems to be all around...
What about down?
Yes, Griff?
We're dead in the water.  But it indicates we're moving!
We read you!  Go ahead, Doctor!  They're inside the saucer.  It's filled with breathable air!
...above Murmansk, and Finland.
We took for granted his source of energy was nuclear.  But suppose it isn't at all - what if it's <u>magnetic</u>?
What?
Obviously.
Been putting my files into it. You take sugar and milk?
He musta found out. They had to get rid of him. And Jack'll get blamed.
Jesus. How much... how much will the whole thing cost?
Shit! What are we gonna do?
Yep. Right about now the does are holing up in the brush piles. The bucks are right behind them and we're right behind the bucks.  This gun gets fired before ten o'clock. Whether it kills a deer or not is more less up to you. I'll put you inside 30, 35 yards of a buck the first four hours of the season. That's what you're paying me for, ain't it?
You take care of your end, kid, I'll take care of mine.
You understand what I'm saying? I want a deer, a dead one, not a cripple or whatthefuck.
This way.
LaRiviere's having a hell of a time in there. Master of fucking ceremonies.
No, I mean whereabouts.
A half mile in, along the old lumber road.
You bring him up yourself? That's a steep climb.
Saw him do it?
Twombley sure as hell won't be shooting it again.
Who's fault is it then if it's not yours? You're the one in charge, Daddy.
Yeah.
To us it was.
No. I didn't used to be bad. No sir. Where do you get this stuff? From your mother?
It's stupid.
It's fun.
No.
No what?
Jesus. Listen, Jill, tell you what. Tomorrow morning, you still want to go home, I'll drive you down. I'll get off work or something.
Come and get you! Shit! It's a damn half hour drive each way. Why didn't you talk to me about it first?
She's gone already!  Gone already! Couldn't wait.
Dad.
That's illegal, you know.
I know.
I want to go home.
His son-in-law damn near killed me.
What am I -- a security guard? You hired me, you and your Selectman friends.
I'm fine, fine.
So?
What's the difference? Take my truck, take a rest -- stop worrying about Mel Gordon. Have you decided what to do with your old man's place -- he going to stay there?
We should talk.
I heard he was drunk at Toby's last night and got in a fight with Hettie. He drove off without her...
Jack doesn't need money.
What way?
Then... I guess you have to.
How?
When did she die?
Can --?
Jesus Christ. Mr. Gordon, when I come all the way to serve somebody a summons, I don't call ahead for an appointment.
Don't give me a hard time, Mr. Gordon. I'm just --
Yes. Here's your ticket.
Well, yeah, I suppose. Sure. I just had a little business to settle with Mr. Gordon. I'm the local police officer.
That goddamned woman. Thinks she can cart Jill off and leave me alone like this. I'm more than pissed, Margie. I'm a whole lot more than pissed. I been that plenty and I know the difference. This is different.
Not since last night. He took a guy hunting.
Jack?
The other guy.
Wade, I got a message for you.  Jack Hewitt, he's looking for you. Wants you to clear your stuff out of his office in Town Hall.
Just do it.
Why didn't you call and have the furnace fixed?
Pop, for Christ's sake!
Where the Christ you going? You sonofabitch, you leave my fucking truck where it is! I need... Give me the Goddamn keys! I need to get me to town!
Yeah, I know him -- the kid that was with him. Maybe you do too. Jack Hewitt. He works for LaRiviere with me. He's my best friend.
It'll come out Jack lied and the kid'll get hung for it.
Huh?
Anyone else want one? Rolfe?
I guess it was an accident, like everybody thinks.
Which is?
They wouldn't deal with a guy like Jack. Who else benefits if Twombley is suddenly dead?
Okay. It's likely there are people in the union who don't want Twombley to testify. They probably include his son-in-law who's vice-president and will probably be the next president. I read that in the papers. What's his name, Mel Gordon?
A hunting accident is perfect.
You think I wouldn't remember a thing like that?
And Elbourne and Mom took you to the doctor and told him you fell from the hay loft.
Then you accidentally see your body, or your face, or whatever, and you don't know who the hell it belongs to. Strange. It's the business with the old man, I know, and how incredibly pissed I was at him, and also chasing Jack Hewitt like that, and the Goddamned truck going through the ice, not to mention Margie's being so upset -- one thing on top of another.
You don't want to say hi to your father?
I'm sorry, honey.
Yeah, I study world events. Five thousand Turkienistan Muslims were slaughtered in Stravanvitch's cleansings... along with 15 American school kids. You know hQw I studied that. I went to their funerals with my dad. I met their parents.
Fuck off, you stupid asshole.
It's some kind of trick... a preliminary airstrike in response to our troop movement.
Do you see the maintenance panel?
Got it.
U.S. Pilots, this is Air Force One.
Put your pilot on.
The Iraqi ambassador is claiming it's just an exercise.
You're duty to what? The country you served doesn't exist anymore.
Air Force One, please reduce speed to 250 knots.
This is a remarkable aircraft.
And all these rooms here?
You're pointing a gun at me.
Or you will do what, Mrs. Marshall?  But I admire your courage. Your husband, on the other hand...
We've already played our cards, Major. There's no turning back.
May I speak to you for a moment?
Don't.  I know spin control when I feel it.
How did your speech go?
I don't know why you stayed.
Excuse me?
Where's my family?
Don't cut me off. This is an emergency.
Okay... if you're the President, when's your wife's birthday?
With all due respect, sir, maybe you should give them this one.  Your numbers are still pretty low and you called in a lot of chips to nail Stravanavitch.
I might still have a few chips left.
Sir, the Speaker of the House attacked this administration on national television.  You can't afford to leave that hanging.
How long's it been since you flew, sir?
That just doesn't make any sense.
Yes I did...
Ted, you're overworked.  You've been flying yourself into the ground.
Elaine, we have to go back.
There's something dangerously wrong with this ship, Elaine.  I know its the wiring. That toilet's just the tip of the iceberg.
Ted!
Kurtz was the one who got us into this mess in the first place.  You people knew this ship wasn't ready to fly.  You played God with over a hundred lives, Kruger, and for what -- the prestige of your precious space program.
Well, Elaine, this might be it if those guys on the ground don't think of something.
Are you afraid?
Set!
Simon, why has he become so... so...
Simon, what's happening?!
He tried to disconnect ROK.  It gassed him.  That computer is running this ship and we're heading right for the sun.
He's a boy dog.
Which passenger is Joe Salucci?
Do you want to talk about it.
People change in relation to each other. Love changes on its own.
Not if the people change together in relation to that love.
I happened to be passing, and I thought you might like some corfee.
Well, it really wasn't a vacation. You see, I'm a teacher in the New York City school system, and I was attending a seminar on visual aids to education. Are you from L.A.?
I wish I could fool myself into believing that that's the reason. The truth of the matter is, nobody ever asked me.
Well, to tell the truth, they really didn't fill me in on many of the details. Just told me to pick up Captain Kramer.
Yeah, something like that, but as I say, they didn't have time to tell me very much.
Can you fly this airplane and land it?
Surely you can't be serious.
Elaine, I haven't time to put this gently, so I'll be very direct. Everyone of us on this plane is in a desperate situation. Mister Striker is the only hope we've got.
...safe and sound and free to pursue a life of religious fulfillment.
What is it, Doctor? What's happening?
A hospital? What is it?
I won't be back. I've requested the Atlanta run.
That's the way I've always wanted it to be, Elaine.
You got a telegram from headquarters today.
But Ted, you're the only...
You promise you'll write.
What did you think of 'Great Expectations?'
Would either of you like another cup of coffee?
Do you feel all right, sir?
Well, I flew in the war, but that was a long time ago. I wouldn't know anything about it.
We are with the Police Department. This is Sergeant Sykes, and I am--
The young woman at the front said you might know where he is.
Yes...
Man, somebody really hung one on you!  I've heard some good ones for you guys... Humphrey Bogart, Harley Davidson.  I guess the people at immigration got a little punchy after a while, coming up with names for a quarter of a million of you. You weren't at the back of the line, were you, George?
His body was discovered three days ago, in an alley off of Central Avenue, near downtown.
Yes.
What's this?  What's going on?
Nothing.
And that fits?
Mrs. Porter is not taking her husband's death well.
She didn't know him.  But she said her son might.
Why'd I do what?
Screw you.
How could a straight-arrow like you ever pick a roommate like him?
We were chasing you because you ran, you dumb son-of-a-bitch.
You are married?
Your home is quite disordered.  I thought perhaps you had been burglarized when I walked in.
In the other man's rectum.
Your health...
No shit, Holmes.  You're only from another goddamn planet, for chrissakes.
I hope you can understand how special your world is... how unique a people you humans are.  So it us all the more painful and confusing to us that so few of you seem capable of living up the the ideals you set for yourselves.
Where'd you get this?!!
Stop the car.
Why?
What is it?
Only holds five.
Yeah, the shells are too big for six in an cylinder.  Hell, Matt, you don't need but one.
Try Joshua Strader, will ya, darlin'?
You took this gut out, too, didn't you?
Yeah.
Flame-units only.  I want rifles slung.
And it's too late to shut it down?
I'm really the only one qualified to remote-pilot the ship anyway. Believe me, I'd prefer not to.  I may be synthetic but I'm not stupid.
Look, I believe you, but there are going to be some heavyweights in there.  You got Feds, you got interstellar commerce commission, you got colonial administration, insurance company guys...
What about you?  What's your interest in this?
Yeah, yeah.  I saw the commercial.
That's not what I mean.  Gorman, if your men have to use their weapons in there, they'll rupture the cooling system.
Don't make me pull rank, Ripley.
Corporal Hicks!?
You've been doing your homework. Look, they can't impound it if they don't know about it.
...We're coming in.
Hah!  Stop your grinnin' and drop your linen!  Found 'em.
We gotta figure on them getting into the complex.
You know, Burke, I don't know which species is worse.  You don't see them screwing each other over for a fucking percentage.
Locked.
You can't help them.  Right now they're being cocooned just like the others.
Can't be.  That's inside the room!
The 'maze'?  You mean the air ducts?
Ripley...she doesn't have bad dreams because she's just a piece of plastic.
Oh.  Sorry, Newt.
These Viennese certainly know good music when they hear it.
Oh? News travels fast in Vienna.
Well even if there is, I don't think you want to get involved with this one.
Well, do you know where it's set, my dear?
A Turkish brothel.
Don't bother.
What??
No! I won't have him back.
I'm not surprised. Money seems to be more important to him than loyalty or friendship. He has sold himself to Vienna. Let Vienna look out for him.
Humiliated?
Dinner? How dare you? I am a nobleman. I only dine with people of my own height.
In the pot, I have got a good dinner. Not a sausage or stew, but a singer. Not a sausage or stew but a singer. Is the treat that I'll eat for my meat!
Where?
Where?
Because here everything goes backwards. People walk backwards, dance backwards, sing backwards, and talk backwards.
Just say it - you'll see. It's very serious. Em iram!  Em iram!
Yes.
Look, old man, you stay out of this. We spend a fortune on you, more than we can possibly afford, and all you do is criticize, morning to night. And then you think you can -
Wolfi.
No. Don't answer it!
I can't write it!
That's right, Your Excellency. I've come on behalf of my hus band. I'm - I'm bringing some samples of his work so he can be considered for the royal appointment.
He's terribly busy, sir.
I will look at them, of course, the moment I can. It will be an honour. Please give him my warmest.
I'm afraid I'm not at leisure this very moment. Just leave them with me. I assure you they will be quite safe.
Really?
But! I'm a married woman!
Am I interrupting something?
Who was your teacher?
It's just a trifle, of course.
Excuse me, Sire, but what do you think these could be? Being a foreigner, I would love to learn.
Yes, of course. My concern is to protect you from any suspicion of favouritism.
I'm sure there is a way, Majesty. Some kind of a little contest. I could perhaps put together a small Committee, and I could see to it naturally that it will select according to Your Majesty's wishes.
I don't understand. There are just as many notes, Majesty, as are required. Neither more nor less.
Majesty, this is Madame Weber. She is my landlady.
Twenty-six.
Bravo, Mozart. Most charming. Yes, indeed. Clever man.
Sire, I swear to Your Majesty, there's nothing like that in the story. I have taken out everything that could give offense. I hate politics.
Yes, sir.
Well, what do you have for me today?
Why are you here?
Am I not welcome?
It couldn't be better.
What do you mean? It's wonderful. Really, it's - it's marvelous! People love me here.
Never mind. You won't have to do anything for me ever again. I'm leaving!
Good morning, sir.
I don't know. He has pains.
What?
Of course! What else do you think they speak here?
Wolfi!
What is this?
What? The vaudeville, what'd you think?
Well, this is hardly the way to go about it.
Whom did they choose?
Do you have a daughter?
Forgive me. We all have patriotic feelings of some kind.
What exactly are you working on?
I can't say. Really
Oh, I could kill him! I mean really kill him. I actually threw the entire opera on the fire, he made me so angry!
Mozart. It was good of you to come.
I have come to commission work from you.
What work?
How long will you give me?
I'm taking you home. You're not well.
This is only a vaudeville.
Do you mean that?
No! No, it's him!
Wait! Ask him if he'd give me some money now. Tell him if he would, that would help me finish it.
Yes. Can I - could I help you, in any way?
Oh, yes.
Start with the voices. Basses first. Second beat of the first measure - A.  Con-fu-ta-tis.  Second measure, second beat.  Ma-le-dic-tis.  G-sharp, of course.
First bassoon and tenor trombone - what?
Do you have it?
Oh? Have I seen it?
That will do, Herr Mozart!
Did you not know that His Majesty has expressly forbidden ballet in his operas?
Yes, but this is not a ballet. This is a dance at Figaro's wedding.
Exactly. A dance.
Can we see the scene with the music back, please?
My dear fellow, the language is not finally the point. Do you really think that subject is quite appropriate for a national theatre?
You tried to take your life. You do remember that, don't you?
Do you understand that you have sinned? Gravely.
I didn't. That was Mozart. Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart. You know who that is?
Did you try?
I do not claim to unravel the mysteries. I treasure them. As you should.
My son, why should you want all Vienna to believe you a murderer? Is that your penance? Is it?
Yes?
Ballet? What ballet?
Excuse me - didn't His Majesty specifically forbid ballet in his opera?
Here I am, my angel.
Well, I don't know! I mean you're a delicious, delightful, delectable little bird, but don't you think you might be just a little tough?
That lady is back, sir.
Well, he's sleeping now. Better not.
Well, tell him we were here, won't you?
And say everything went wonderfully. A triumph-de-luxe - say that! Tell him the audience shouted his name a hundred times.
The American? Yes, duck.
You know, did he seem depressed? Do you think he'll eat the food?
I'm an orderly, not a bleeding psychiatrist! I push things about, but I've little say what happens to them.
What exactly did he call out?
The police report said an escaped lunatic attacked them. He must have been a very powerful man. Although I really don't see that it is any of your concern, Miss Price.
Yes, sir.
Oh, I don't mean running about on all fours and howling at the moon. But in such a deranged state he could harm himself, or perhaps others.
Have you read the papers today? Have you listened to the radio or television?
What shall we do?
Yes?
Call me Alex.
Aw come on, Alex!
Call me David.
This is absurd. I'm not hungry. I don't want any food.
How old are you?
A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court by Samuel L. Clemens. This is after the preface but before chapter one: A Word of Explanation. You all right?
I've left those pills for you.
David! Where on earth have you been!?!
Hopeless. It's hopeless.
Hello, Benjamin.
Chart says he's from New York.
Miss Price.
Who is this girl?
This isn't Mr. Goodman's idea. He is your good friend, whereas I am a victim of your carnivorous lunar activities.
No one brought them here! No one wanted them here!
What are you going to see?
Do you have bad dreams, too?
London? Where's Jack? I had a strange dream.
You've been unconscious since you were brought in two weeks ago.
You've suffered some rather severe cuts and bruises, lost a bit of blood, but nothing too serious; black and blue for a while. You'll have some dueling scars to boast of. That lunatic must have been a very fierce fellow. They say a mad man has the strength of ten.
You've never had bad dreams before?
Did you get a good look at the man who attacked you?
Look, Dr. Hirsch, I know I've been traumatized, but Jack was torn apart. I saw him. A man can't do that to someone with his bare hands.
I really don't know.
Rendezvous in Rome starring Jack Goodman and Debbie Klein. The love affair that shocked Europe! See torrid lovemaking at its most explicit! See Jack and Debbie expose their lust in the sacred halls of the Vatican! Never has the screen dared...
It's a five-pointed star.
You ask them.
Go on, ask them.
Maybe that pentangle was for something supernatural.
The Hound of the Baskervilles.
Plan?
Nice doggie. Good boy.
Nice to see you.
Hurting your feelings? Has it occurred to you that it may be unsettling to have you rise from your grave to visit me? Listen to me, I'm talking to a hamburger!
Aren't you supposed to be buried in New York someplace?
What's wrong with you? Shut up!
David, please believe me. You will kill people, David. You've got to stop the bloodshed before it begins.
The supernatural! The powers of darkness! It's all true. Take your own life! Suicide, David. Join me.
You don't have to say anything.
You look awful.
I could hang myself.
What here?
He's on the telephone.
No, thank you.
He may have a point, Lieutenant. Two strong boys would be able to defend themselves against one man.
Say Matt, I'll have to have some money for those Manville payrolls.
Say, do me a favor, will you Charlie?
I'll pay it back to you Saturday - on the level I will. Give a guy a break, will you? I've got to get it back in my account. If Helen ever finds out that I
Dickson doesn't have to go. But he must agree to this merger with New York Trust
We'll be forced to shut the doors. I've worked twenty-five years night and day to keep this bank alive. You've all made money out of it. Are you willing to help?
Aw, they've gone crazy. You can't reason with a mob.
Of course, yes. Just what would you like to know, Inspector?
What was my wife doing in your apartment last night?
Nothing, nothing, Mr. Dickson. Don't pay any attention to me. I don't know what I'm saying.
That don't do us any good.
Why, I couldn't do that . . . !
What do you mean?
For a celebrated bounder, that is an awful admission. Besides, I never knew that any female could do this to you .
Here, here, here, now! Don't you go back to work on me, too. I'm getting tired of this. Besides, it's beginning to affect your looks
Come on Cyril, try a little bit of it out on me. I haven't had any first-class blarney thrown at me since the day I was married.
Oh! Oh, no!  I think I've done enough experimenting for one day. Congratulations, Cyril. You've convinced me that you're a philanderer of the very first order. I shall recommend you highly.
My apartment.
No. No, I'm afraid papa isn't that much interested. He's too busy rushing off to Philadelphia to make stuffy, old speeches at stuffy, old bankers' meetings. Too busy closing big, important deals  I think I will have a drink.
Excuse me
I don't care whether it's important or not. You said you were going out with me, and if you hadn't promised so faithfully, I wouldn't have gone and planned the whole thing.
Listen, it isn't so terribly important. We can go to the theatre any time.
That's what it was you planned, wasn't it?
Yes, of course.
You can take some of the girls. You can take Mildred - or Gwynn
Well . . .
Helen, tell Matt I want to see him.
Helen, I'm going to Philadelphia, just as soon as the bank closes. Make all the arrangements, will you?
Helen!
Yes, thank you.
But, Mr. Dickson, I thought you were going to take care of the mortgage. I only want ten thousand. The property is worth sixty.
Yes, sir.
It's all right. Thanks.
I already told him I was home.
Wait a minute. Wait a minute.  Matt, do you realize you're up against something? You're being charged with murder. It's serious, son. Now come on, I know you didn't do it.  But we've got to make them believe it. Come on, tell the truth, where were you last night?
Helen, while you're downtown, you might stop in and make reservations for the bridal suite on the Berengaria sailing next week.
Well, Sampson, what is it?
Get all the big bills in the place. Take them out and get them changed. Get nothing but ones and fives. Distribute them among the tellers. Tell them to take their time. Stall as much as possible. Count and recount the money.
Yes, sir.
Is it safe?
How-do-you-do, Mrs. Dickson.
I'm afraid so.
Oh, Charlie again.
Oh now, don't be silly.
Shh . . . !  I'll wait for you upstairs.
Dickson's in a jam I tell you. The run's getting worse.
He was in the bank yesterday.
Do you know this young man, Mrs. Halligan?
What time was it?
I didn't do it! I haven't got a gun!
Eleven o'clock, eh? Are you sure it was that?
Everybody in?
Certainly, Mr. Jones! Certainly! Charlie!
This is healing?
It's still taking too long. The people used to snap to.
I ain't done --
Things changed when you quit the gang. For example, I'm now the one who says "Let's ride."
My plan of lying here pissing myself seems to be working mighty fine, thank you.
They came up, made the same offer they made you folks. Our little brother Jim tried to chase 'em off, one of those detectives hit him in the head, knocked him out. Cole lost his temper.
The Army can hang him.
This is about the "Wanted!" Posters, isn't it.
Listen, he's my brother and I don't want to start trouble...
Home, boys. Back to our farms.
She was European!
I got seven thousand.
It'll be the biggest score yet.
I think one of 'em's glass.
Oh, Lord, the dance hall girl at Bunty's...
Another dozen out back.
So?
Well, I hope the boy pulls through. We should know in the morning.
So you're saying I could have done more to attract their attention.
See, that's your problem, Frank. By the time you finish figuring out stuff, I'm already finished doing it.
Whyyyy... he took down the Gatling gun and the cannon all by himself.
You can shut up now.
I don't think it's counterfeit. Do you mind if I take a look at all your real bills to compare?
It got to you, didn't it. All the killing in the war. You need it now.
What do you want me to say, Frank? I was killing men when I was fifteen. I like getting shot at. I like riding out of town with a posse at my back. This is a helluva better life than farming.
I'll meet you down there in a few weeks.
So what was he?
Easterners.
Riders --
You were little Jesse James when you left.
But still died.
No! I mean, of course not. No.
Everybody in the county knows it was you who rescued Cole. We're all so proud of you, Jesse. And not a single farm's been sold to the railroad since. You're everybody's hero.
Ahem. "From this doctrine..." No, ah... "From women's eyes this doctrine I derive, they sparkle still like ... shiny... sparkling rocks..."
Is this one of Frank's Shakespeare poems you're trying to quote?
Jesse. What are you thinking? There are bounty hunters and lawmen all over this county!
That's... wonderful. It's just... I thought...
Are you going to be happy here, Mr. James? Without all that excitement?
"Hmm" what?
Jesse, have you ever noticed that when you're trying to charm your way out of trouble, your accent gets all farm boy?
What?
You get arrested again, I'll kill you.
We're moving you tomorrow.
You almost ended my career before it began.
That's what I would have done.
I'm not hanged yet.
Discretion? Sir, I am a man of the cloth.
I hope you don't mind, Jesse James told me your name.
Thank you, Miss -- ?
Devereux. My brother Cole dated a European girl once.
Well, this land is about to be condemned.
They had to be dealt with!
A further impediment is that the Army garrison has been ordered to move on from Liberty. We will no longer have that particular stick with which to threaten the farmers.
I see. I'll get together four patrols of our detectives for action tonight.
Thirty-five thousand, sir. Coins and currency. And the delay from the miles of destroyed track --
I'll kill them for blowing up my railway!
To be precise, they didn't blow up the tracks.
This is him.
How did you know?
I can't believe this.
Yes, that's the way to win the locals back to our side.
Can't you tell me anything?
Pumpkin you're dating an asshole.
Pumpkin, you're dating a tumbling, tumbling dickweed.
Is that Donald Trump's car?
Are we here?
We were supposed to have dinner at Tad and Maura's, but-you know how Luis is...
Listen...Patrick. Can we talk?
So, you're looking great, how have you been?
Well, I actually might need a little surgery after last time.
Your hairline looks like it's receding.
We never really shared one.
Picked them up from the printers yesterday
Good coloring.
Ed Gein? Maitre d' at Canal Bar?
I think you should go now.
But I think...I want to know what happened here.
Davis. I'm not one to bad-mouth anyone, your joke was amusing. But come on, man, you had one fatal flaw: Bateman's such a dork, such a boring, spineless lightweight, that I couldn't fully appreciate it. I wasn't fooled for a second. Now, if you'd said Price, or McDermott...Otherwise, it was amusing. Now, let's have lunch or dinner or something. Hilarious, Davis. A killer.
Now, if you'll excuse me, I really must...
It's just not.
Lucky, I guess.
Call me please, Patrick.
What...is...it?
Yes, Caron's right. Gorbachev's not downstairs. He's at Tunnel.
Just...say...no.
I'll do it.
Oh, I don't know. No, we'll go anywhere you want.
You didn't give them a name.
Want a bite?
And don't tell me you enjoy working with children, okay?
Maybe. I don't know Not really. Bateman opens up a cupboard where there are a lot of very Bateman opens a cupboard where there are a lot of neatly ordered weapons - an ax, a rifle, a chain saw, duct tape, twine and a nail gun.
What do you think I do?
Welt...it depends, why?
You think I'm dumb. You think all models are dumb.
No. I really don't.
Well.
Let's not get lewd.  I'm in no mood to have a lewd conversation.
So, what's the topic of discussion?
He led what I suppose was an orderly life. He... ate a balanced diet.
Where did Paul hang out?
So was I.
But...has anyone seen him in London?
Hmmm.
No, it actually hadn't. Toiletries were missing. A suit was gone. So was some luggage. That's it.
The earth just opens up and swallows people. 
Isn't the Four Seasons a little far uptown? I mean aren't you going to be late?
How's the investigation going? Taken anyone in for "formal questioning?" 
I actually came to see Timothy Price, but he's taken a leave of absence.
Yeah, gone into rehab. Shame.  Is he a suspect?
Do you remember where you were on the night of Paul's disappearance?  Which was on the twentieth of December?
Not in the mood, I guess.
So, the night he disappeared? Any new thoughts on what you did?
Marcus?
Where was Marcus?
I can't...I can't find a shelter
And how's Cecilia? She's a great girl.
They still have to give 'em refreshments laced with mind-altering drugs.
You know what he's like. He just wants to work on stuff that's cool.
A lot of what Larry says is true. They just clone stuff, or reverse engineer it, and everybody gets stuck with their inferior version cause they --
That took some fun out of --
It's the way he said it. Just the way my dad did, when he was caught in a lie. That's how you knew you were onto something ugly.
He's your boss. He's not your --
I can't see Outpost putting its reputation in the hands of people like that.
Go where? You can't get away from people like this.
It's the only one with dishes on the roof. The studio's a front. That's why they keep postponing its opening.  ...gotta get in there.
After I broke into 21 -- which was insane, thank God they didn't catch me! -- I just drove around. Trying to figure out what possessed me. You know what? I've been putting my own guilt on Gary.
What?
It's for the Museum. He knows you're a painter. If anybody should be invited --
Are you gonna tell me where you went?
It's gonna get cold.
Right... What's that mean again?
...It's -- Milo, isn't it?
I -- just wanna help bring these guys to justice. They're neo-Nazis.
No. But you can write your own ticket in the Valley after this. We're gonna bring down Outpost.
There's no hard evidence he knew about this. Anybody who could implicate him seems to've vanished.
Milo? Gary Boyd. I'm hoping you and your friend can come up here. We've made some amazing strides in digital convergence. I'd love to show them to you.
You know a lot about art, I guess.
Among other things... We know convergence is the real super-highway: all the PC's, TV's, phones, etc. linked together. Why cram it into a cable if you can use the whole sky?
How's it going?
...My dad was a compulsive gambler. Only he didn't think he was. That applied to guys who didn't have a "system." "Losers," who played games of chance. He could "read" people, so chance had nothing to do with it. No matter how deep a hole he dug himself, he'd give you the whole speech. And you'd better not point out the obvious.  His creditors would catch up to him. Loan sharks or whatever. He'd wake us in the middle of the night. Off we'd go, again.
No. I just went deeper into the machine. Preferred being the geek to having to explain. Lying would've been worse.
Longitude 109 --
Wait... He knows.
I think you should go.
He was on the verge of something, too. He was gonna show us the next day. He said "The answer's not in the box, it's in the band." Know what it means?
Man, could he write code. Totally elegant. He had his own style.
Me too! Were you an Army brat or something?
Why's that?
But they'd still get the idea, right?
What'd he say?
They know I broke in. Alice helped me.  Shrot's not one of them. He's blundering into this on his own.
You could always say you have to go the bathroom.
Why?!
Not much. Glorified cherry bomb. Right by the civil defense sign? Some geek's idea of irony. I been saying we need a camera in this hall.
That's very clever. Do you know any other poems?
Thank you, that's beautiful. To your health.
Yes.
Just where you'd never think to look for him. We'll be there.
Be careful.
Yes, I'm having trouble controlling...  THE VOLUME OF MY VOICE!
Be careful.
Thank you, Exposition.
Then you'll have to go it alone. Good luck.
Thank you, Basil.
Hey Austin Powers, it's me, Mick Jagger.
Your freedom has cause more pain and suffering in the world than any plan I ever dreamed of. Face it, freedom failed.
It seems the tables have turned again, Dr. Evil.
I went to Oxford and excelled in several subjects, but I ended up specializing in foreign languages. I wanted to travel -- see the world. In my last year I was accepted into the M.O.D. in the Cultural Studies sector. I thought I was off on an exciting career, but my job was to read everything printed in every country. It's very boring. My whole day is spent reading wedding announcements in Farsi. If I do well with this case, I finally get promoted to field operative...
What?
I can't see a bloody thing.
How do you know?
Let me tell you a story. There's these two bulls on top of a hill checking out some foxy cows in the meadow below. The young bull says, 'hey, why don't we run down the hill and shag us a cow?', and the wise old bull replies, 'no, why don't we walk down the hill and shag all the cows?'
I don't get it.
Sorry. Move your hand to the left. There you go. Gorgeous.
Not in the Nineties.
Yes.
Likewise.
Kiss me.
Actually, my name's Austin Powers.
Here, have a piece of gum.
Commander, this is Slater in SoWest Com Three. We have a potential bogey with erratic vectoring and an unorthodox entry angle.
What are you saying, son?
Oh my God, he's back.
Should we scramble TacHQ for an intercept?
Ow! You shot me!
Remember when we froze your semen, you said that if it looked like you weren't coming back to try and make you a son so that a part of you would live forever?
Hello, Scott. I'm your father, Dr. Evil.  I have a son! I have a son! Everyone, I have a son!  Someday, Scott, this will all be yours.
No. Maybe, like, work in a petting zoo or something.
In due time.
Why don't you just shoot him now? Here, I'll get a gun. We'll just shoot him. Bang! Dead. Done.
He's asleep.
I'm proud of you.
You have to understand, in Britain in the Sixties you could be a sex symbol and still have bad teeth. It didn't matter.
Normally, we'd be eager to oblige --
... preserve...
Then you can't come in.
Then who wins?
London. The World Council of Ministers meets soon on global defence. If you can control the weather, you control the world.
You need treatment, Mrs. Peel.  You can't resign.
About your next assignment, Mrs. Peel ...
Choices?
Whereas you are.
Dyed in the wool. But I can admire someone who doesn't play by the rules.
Oh, absolutely, but Trubshaw's a man worth meeting. No point setting out half shod.
Ah, Brenda ...  Mrs. Peel?
Mother and Dr. Darling have me under observation. They think I tried to kill you.
Either way ... may I ask: why you dress in that fashion?
Colonel Crabtree. International Satellite Systems. Formerly of the Ministry.
Well, he was a fellow of the Royal Zoological Society ...
But if someone miniaturized the process...
... And by you, Mrs. Peel ...
Not that I know of.  Explanation?
I'm playing to win.
You first.
No bother. Mother and Father think I've joined you. I might as well.
I don't recall Siberia being this warm, Steed.
Your mission is simple. Find out how and why these agents died.
Now let's see ... Eton, Cambridge ... research into robotics and plastics. Overtaken by Peter's work on the physics of climate change ...
You reek of Mrs. Peel's Black Leather ...
Mother betrayed me. She was going to replace me with a younger Father.  Errand boy that's all I was. 'Find Steed...'
Your research into climate engineering was state-of-the-art. Your experiments could have revolutionized our knowledge of global warming -- had they succeeded. We need your expertise.
Still doesn't. Better safe than sorry.  She was in a dangerous game, Steed. High stakes. She may prove to be a risk.  If she is, there's only one solution.  Termination.
Anyone particular in mind?
Cocky little bastard. I hope he was a baddy.
Good. Glad to see they're together at last. They don't get along. Promotion. Top job. Most unfair. Quite a fuss at the Ministry.
Wonderland Weather Ltd.
Mrs. Peel -- ?
Does Cole know about this?
Debbie... I don't believe it. I'm so excited.
He still thinks I'm going with him. I'm going to break the news to him tomorrow.
What do you mean?
Rick's got an important announcement to make.
I've decided not to run for President.
All right!
Great car.
I love that car.
Shit, shit, shit, shit. My car's gone!
All right, I'll go up there and take care of this myself.  You look awful, son. Go find yourself some clothes.
You know, when you dumped me for that wimp, I thought, Cole, she'll be back. God wants the two of you to be together, and sure enough...
Want to hear something great? Bobbie and Phoebe are throwing me a shower. It's really gonna be fun.
Well... twenty-four more hours to go and tonight we'll share with our friends and loved ones the joys of those last moments of singleness.
That doesn't mean it was Rick's party.
They'll be up there in a half hour.
What are you talking about, asshole?
This is bad public relations. I was planning to do a lot of business with you. But now I'm going to have to go elsewhere.
Let's go.
Okay... We're all here. Rick, what's the big announcement?
Sold. 45 minutes. No problem.
That's it.
Lar... sometimes when people are mad they say things they don't mean.
Keep your voices down. This is a respectable establishment. We don't go for any funny business here. Just then a GUY with a Moosehead Beer hat and TWO GUYS in a moose costume pass him and enter the elevator with the boys.
You've been having strange sex...!
Where'd she go?
I'm not really hungry.
What the hell is that?
About what?
Get a few drinks into me, we'll dance and see what happens.
I don't know.
True, you're a lot handsomer now. Don't you have enough blood already?
Oh... it's... er... the guys from the beer convention. We're bringing them to the party.
Can you believe how perfect it fits?
-- He killed people --
I wanted to know why you messed with my station assignment. I mean, is this really gonna have to one of those big brother -- little brother "you broke my GI Joe and I'm still pissed" games?
-- I told you to stay next to me!
You're selling dad's boat?
Everybody did.
What are we going to do about this?
You look great.
Look, I'm not the same girl who had nothing better to do than wrap her legs around you on a Saturday night. This isn't about fun. I'm working here.
-- All I know is that his programs are getting firemen hurt.
C'mon Jennifer, he's just another North-Side jag-off with a mouth.
Homey.
Brian. What's wrong?
-- I work for the city.
Hi.
Yes.
I quit two days ago, Brian.
You walked out on this academy six years ago. One week to graduation. You think we forgot that? You think I did?
Look, everybody remembers your old man. Being his son, all you had to do was breathe to graduate here. Dead Hero Father Rule. But you blew us off. Why should I take you back?
So you were happy here. Warm and cozy and in no hurry...  Soot high, clean unburned wall low, indicates slow burn in thermal balance.  Find me some glass.
Glass found in ignition room is in small, thin pieces, indicating explosion. Lack of discoloration indicates a long, slow burn. Explosion must of come after a slow burn.  You little tease... What were you up to you little bastard, huh? What made you that mad?  Or scared.  It started in this room. Took its time, hung out... but the air ran out. It couldn't breathe. So it was snuffed. But it wasn't dead... still all that trapped heat, lying low, waiting for some sucker to open the door and give it that one gulp of air...
I don't guess.
Four months.
So, you surviving without me?
Really. Well, let's have a look at what else was "in your blood". I always look forward to getting these, they make such a nice collage for the bar... "Assistant Director, Sales, Aspen Snowmobile Tours..."
Uh huh. And "Pioneer's Pride, Mobile Log Cabins". That was in your blood about six months wasn't it?
I was ahead of my time.
Who's going to die?
Brian. He's not doing it right, dad. He never does it right.
Firehouse.
Oh yeah? How's he doing?
Yeah... I just thought I should say, I don't know, something.
Okay.
Coffee? Nah, I gotta go.
Cook and I are almost finished here. Have a seat.
They ran the residue you scraped from both crispers' front doors. It's a combination of plumber's putty and rayophene gum. Burns almost completely away when you light it.
Who's this?
We still haven't found a connection between the victims.
I'm a little busy right now --
Brown Downtown... There hasn't been any smoking brown on the street in --
The Church is a fucking racket. I know how they operate. I've been part of the racket since the first time some faggot priest spilt water on my head. My Aunt Lu says I was crying all the way through. Yeah, I know their game inside out. Now I'm free of it and I'm gonna stay that way.
So what are you doing here?
What the fuck are you? A drug counselor or a drug dealer? And you don't even do your own product! What kind of businessman are you?
Good. I'll give him an extra 10 grand for his trouble. I hate that motherfucking house and --
It's funny, you knew. But the first thing I think of is kneading the bread that I help bake for the soup kitchen. Maybe that's because my the muscles in my arms still hurt.
Keep trying.
Same thing, y'knowwhatI'msayin', y'knowwhatI'msayin'!
You truly are a dancing fool.
Yeah!
YEAH!
If you were really down you would get us together with that boss of yours.  What's his name again?
It's that bad, huh?  It's all over my face.
Sloan is all 'dat.  I try her.  I'm a tri-sexual.
I'm out.
Good morning to you, Mr. Delapot.
Nice to meet you.
Gentlemen, the show, our show will be satirical.  You know what that is, don't you?  Trust me on this one.
And I'm the feet.
I would like to change your name.
To what?
How you sound?
Don't you people get it?  We're in the 21st Century.  Slavery was over four hundred years ago.  All that stuff people talked in the old days, it's over.  Folks always crying, white man this, white man that.  Let's all grow up.
I would prefer you not use that word in my presence.
You got your head stuck up your ass with your Harvard education and your pretentious ways.  Brother man, I'm blacker than you.  I'm keepin' it real and you're frontin', trying to be white.
That's a great handle.
And Sleep 'n Eat is his comical sidekick?
Negroes would be in an uproar.
Mantan right here is a gifted hoofer.  He has educated feet.
In the projects.  Like Eddie Murphy's "The PJ's."
I was hoping to perhaps direct some episodes myself, if not the pilot soon after.
If Spielburg can direct "The Color Purple" and "Amistad", our whiz kid can direct the Mantan pilot.
I will not be held responsible for these revisions.  These changes are not the way I want to go.  This is an outrage.  This is a sham.  A violation!
I don't give a good goddamn about Finland, Norway, Sweden or wherever ya blond ass came from.
They didn't even view a rough cut, just some scenes we quickly cut together.
Go away, unless you got my money.
Enough about me, what's happening with you?
It hit me like a ton of bricks.
You okay?
Just want to say good luck.
Who's side are you on?
It's all good.  You got a hit show, you're gonna need a bank.  Plus, I love these old black collectibles.
How long have you and Hambone been hangin' out?
That crazy brother of yours doesn't think so.
Oh, is he?  You getting jiggy with Mantan?
Please don't go there.
DeLa, you should try it sometime. Come into the light.
That was a mistake, but I don't regret it.
I'm happy for all of us.  It's just we have a great responsibility now. The pressure is on.
Not nervous?  Relaxed?
You've made it from the guttermost to the uppermost.  Don't you know you should never let them see you sweat.  Y'knowwhatI'msayin'?
Let me ask you a question, if I may. How do you think she got the job in the first place?  I don't mean to burst your bubble, Mantan the Marvelous, but Sloan is an opportunity.
It looks delicious.
To answer your question, there are a lot of Negroes in it and what is your definition of buffoons?
C'mon, Mommy.  Daddy hasn't been impressed with anything I've ever done.  From winning my fifth grade Spelling Bee to the present.
Not at all?
Nice to meet you.  If you don't mind me asking you - how old are you?
Well before there was BLACK or AFRICAN AMERICAN, there were NEGROES.  I'M A NEGRO.
Good luck, Jukka.  Do a good show.
I know all of you have seen the overnight ratings.  Through the roof.  But in this game you gotta be one, two, three steps ahead.  I introduce you to Myrna Goldfarb. She's the best media consultant in the biz.
I never had a really real pair before.
I wish I had your natural talent. God only makes that visit once in a while.
What do you mean?
Our guest tonight is the extraordinary, talented performer, Mantan.  Thanks for coming in.
No if you go with the flow, Tavis. That's what a lot of Negroes don't understand.  Protesting isn't gonna do a damn thing.  If people don't like our satire in our number one hit show then don't watch it.  Or better yet write your own show.  Do it better.
To come back to our roots.
Not her, the one with the little...
...that was Vicki, her best friend. Dat dress will cast ya round...
That's what I like about you and me. We git along...
I don't know who I am.
Sleep 'N Eat, I was my wife's husband and grandchild at one and the same time.  And lo' and behold, as the husband of a person's grandmother is his grandfather, I Mantan, became my own grandfather.
Oh you do, huh?
I hope you save a little somethin' somethin'.
Never read a book in my whole life.
Why all of a sudden are you flippin' on me?  This blackface thing was part of the deal from the git-go. Don't even try to play it like you ain't a part of all this.  You down with Delacroix.
How did you get this gig?
Is your mother not afraid on account of the highwayman to let one so young as you travel?
Hoity-toity!  John Best, what's the matter here?
The place seems more a farm than an inn-yard.
The captain was the nephew and heir of the Minister of Police, Herr Galgenstein, a relationship which, no doubt, aided in the younger gentlemen's promotion.
Dorothy might love me or not, as she likes, but Best will have to fight me before he marries her!
Mark this, come what will of it, I swear I will fight the man who pretends to the hand of Dorothy Dugan.  I'll follow him if it's into the church, and meet him there. I'll have his blood, or he shall have mine.  Will you take my message to him, and arrange the meeting?
Oh, it's with pistols we fight.  You are no match for Best with the sword.
Grogan gave me a wink of recognition, but offered no public token of acquaintance and it was not until two days afterwards that he called me into his quarters, and then, shaking hands with me cordially, gave me news which I wanted, of my family.
She took on so at your going away that she was obliged to console herself with a husband.  She is now Mrs. John Best.
The coward!
Ah -- I see.  No, I'm afraid mine are the O'Higgins of Watertown.
I have orders to gag your honor if you cry out, and to give you this purse containing ten thousand frederics if you do not.
Your honor must lower his voice.
Your name is Lazlo Zilagyi?
Herr Seebach was a very kind employer.
And I think he was as much affected as I was at thus finding one of his kindred; for he, too, was an exile from home, and a friendly voice, a look, brought the old country back to his memory again, and the old days of his boyhood.
But they will prevent a meeting at whatever the cost.
I have faced that problem before.
It is distasteful to kill a scoundrel -- that should be work for a hangman.
Perfectly so; and what is more, I will tell you that I love her, and that I am not of a humor to put up with rivals.
Very well; but a man who yields takes to his legs.
No.
Not even that.
It is nonetheless a misfortune, and you will know it when you love.
Then I will respectfully take leave of her.
My husband has convinced me of the contrary.
Let me give a thousand kisses to that heavenly mouth which has told me that I am happy.
Lady Cosgrove, you are an old fool.
The King has determined to send the Chevalier out of the country.
Be off to your work, you pack of rascals, or you will have a good taste of my thong.  Have you lost much?
Considering your financial circumstances, Mr. Cosgrove, it has been impossible to find anyone at all prepared to do any business with you.  I think you may count yourself lucky to have this opportunity. But, obviously, if you would reject this offer, I shall keep trying to find a better one.
Yes, of course.
Now, just have a little patience, my boy.  Your birthday isn't until next week.
One of the boys in the stable told Nelly that you've already bought my horse, and that it's at Doolan's farm, where Mick the groom is breaking it in.  Is that true, papa?
Good evening, Mr. James, have you done with my lady?
Faith, sir, if I want to learn good principles, it's surely better I should apply for them to your lady, and your chaplin than to you?
Not so soon, my dear, as you may fancy perhaps.  Why, man, I have been given over many times these four years, and there was always a candidate or two waiting to apply for the situation.  Who knows how long I may keep you waiting.
Don't like 'em, don't eat 'em, don't make no damn difference to me.
It's ten thirty in the morning.
You know the law -- no liquor before noon. Could lose my license.
Did -- did you --
You framed-him...
This isn't our area. Whose area is this --
What about you, wandering around alone? At least we have an alibi --
It's... too slow.
There's no need...
Hey, Ray! Just had a nice talk with your buddy Kendall -- seems you killed three people!
That'd be my reaction too --
You shot Childs and Nunez.
They would have killed us both. You want me to write a confession, I'll write a confession.
You saved Kendall's life --
Do what?
Epilepsy.
We can prove that you're not Ray Dunbar. Impersonating a fellow Cadet is a court-martial in and of itself --
How do you know that?
Look in my pack.
I've done nothing wrong.  I'm the victim here.
Senator Daddy must be thrilled.
No. I said Dunbar.
And the problem is you only got three.
There was a hurricane, Bill, the wind probably moved it.
You mean not enough to save you.
Wording and your friendship with the Colonel aside, I'm not comfortable having you involved in this.
Because interrogation rooms look suspiciously like interrogation rooms, which doesn't exactly put people at ease. Is he cute?
Excuse me?
You really want to make banal chit- chat like that now?
Typical army brat story. Dad was noncom, Mom was a Nurse. There was never any real doubt of joining up.
Dunbar.
So it's a good plan but it goes wrong; Mueller flips out and shoots their fall guy, which means they have to bring Dunbar and Kendall into the cover story --
That bugs you too?
What?
We got maybe three minutes till they break it down.
Nah.
I remember now, it was before the explosion --
Oh, you remember now --
What the fuck happened to you --
Until we return to base, and ballistics can match your weapon to the slugs in Sergeant West's body --
So?
He's not Army, it's not official --
What do you think?
Sir, yes, sir!
Yes!
Someone stole my backpack.
I was wrong about you kid. You may not have much, but what you got, you got a lot of. You could get any girl.
You were expecting me?
Or are you too scared?
I'll go in right now and get that eye.
Bloom!
How long have you known my father?
Eighteen.
Helping people makes me happy.
I won't be selling you this house, Mr. Bloom.
I know.
Can I take your picture?
I never knew.
You know anyone's who's taken it?
When did you ever work in an office?
There's a lot you don't know about me.
Son?
Then you shouldn't have started with a question. Because people want to answer questions. You should have started with, "The thing about icebergs is..."
What do you want, Will? Who do you want me to be?
Tell me how it happens.
Logically, you couldn't be the Witch, because she was old back when he was young.
Thank you. I'll bet you need to --
You never told me how your parents met.
That's because most of it never happened.
We swam. The Atlantic, it's not that big really.
We rented a car.
Yes.
So you never bought any land.
What for?
I've been buying you stuff all week. I've been buying him stuff all week.
How's that? We can't drink our piss can we?
We better watch him. He's crazy.
So?
Tell me what he said.
Unless. Unless this is part of the routine. You get tied up, stick around, distract me, they both bust in and Steal My Cup Of Coffee.
So what are you going to do?
I'm going to drink my coffee. Then, we're going to the police station. Where there will be lawyers, loss of job, house, humiliation, gutter press, and probably prison.
I do. I want to very badly.
What?
Shut up. Have you got your passport?
Give me some money.
So, uh, Alexei, which I know isn't his name...
Of course. Of course. Of course he does. Of course. Thank you. Thanks.
And that would be Morals. That would be one's own moral sense of decency.
So. What then? You just detach sex from everything..
Well, it's just that the thought trying to charm up an erection in front of a woman, or alone for that matter, makes me want to die.
Excuse me?
Get out
You are throwing me out.
The thin... the girl with small eyes. The one in your cupboard.
She's alive!! She is not dead?
You know you can come under the blanket.
Why?
You know the rules.  You do know the rules, don't you?
Thank you.  Oh. My wife. She had a card here for her migraine pills. She ain't gonna be around no more... So if you...
Just wanted to say how much I appreciate you helping me the other day. My niece, she's cured up, and I got you to thank.
I bet you have loyal customers.
Wanna get on somebody 'bout live music, get on ol' Laz, there. He the one got this place shakin' back in the day.
Hey.
Cuz let me tell you, you boys gotta run the ball more. You get into a kicking game, ya'll gonna lose.
For your hands?
I begged him. Don't see why he had to go...
Better than what you give.
Laz... You can't say nothin'...
God forgive you, for how you done me...
Careful how you point that gun, boy.
You testing me? Huh? You testin' me, old man?
Like a man.
Then I better be on my way. Don't wanna put you out no more.
Way I see it, it's gonna take a while for you to get right.
Stop it! Stop it! IT HURTS!
I said... STOP!
I don't fuckin' cook.
I can handle that.
Oh, Laz... he hurt me. He... hurt me so many times.
You took care of your wife, like you do me?
Sorry.
What I love.
Do you call it a game when only one man win each time? I think you call it a damn shame.
Shit. Who hasn't?
Like I say, you wanna hook that up... I ain't in ya way. That switch of hers been all over this town. Got that sickness, you know.
You get a call from Rose?
Ain't gonna be moved?
A naked woman, chained in ya house?
Why don't you go'on and ask her. She need to talk wit somebody with sense. Folks been ruttin' and beatin' on this gal all her days. And this is how I'm handling it.
The hell is this shit?
What? I called Bojo, like you say. Called up the fellas in the band...
You won't at the square this mornin'.
I skipped lunch.
It starts like this... fire... that spreads. Starts in my head. Then moves to my stomach. Then it goes lower. I can stop it sometimes but mostly I just jump on and ride it out... then everything'll go back to normal, you know. Only thing ever took that feeling away was... was... when I met Ronnie.  Cuz I love him so much. He's all I got in my life that's special. And I like taking care of him and helping him when he gets nervous. When I can do that for him... it's like I'm givin' somethin' of myself that I haven't givin' nobody else.
I don't see why we gotta lie 'bout it when you and I know this ain't gonna work.
Well. That's my vomit. I came in here to get sick. I thought I'd make the toilet but... anyway, I got sick.
Got in a little accident.
You need money again?
You got any money?
Mobile technology is the new fix for these niggaz, I'm tellin' you. I'm just lookin' ahead.  Anyways, ain't no money in drugs no more with these rednecks popping cough pills like they's Skittles. Hey, that's what you need, girl. Get you some cough medicine. What, you sick?
What's this?
Nick, let's go hunting.  Bag Cavello.
What'd you say?
I just want you to know... I mean anybody who says you ever took has got to deal with me.
You cool, Ich?
Connie...
Where're you going, Ichiro?
... We got to keep looking.  Track him down!  Great balls of fire!
You must leave?
Did I say that?
Gaiijin.
No...
No.
I'd invite you up but I know you'd hate the incense.  I chant.
Who am I supposed to be?
We're in?
Last time you asked me to come along I nearly got a hole in my head.
Might be different in New York.
Doesn't speak a word of English. And he won't speak Japanese either. No papers.  The Japanese embassy is very interested.
He's wanted in Japan.  They want him first.  Then we can have him.
... Remember, counterfeiting is the Feds.  They'll be all over Abolofia's place.  Stick tight. You I.D. the other plate, he does real time.
We're police officers.
You're foreigners.
Because I want you to tell me.
If anything happens to her while I'm here --
I took Kobo from the street.  I gave him a home, a future... But my ways were too slow for him... I served seven years in prison for my boss when I was a young man.  Kobo wouldn't serve seven minutes for his Oyabun.  He was supposed to take over this syndicate when I retired.
Our associates in New York were close to closing a deal with us.
The families who control the casinos?
Why tell me this?
If he won't cooperate?
Let's go while there is still time.
Where?
It's not an easy thing to meet your maker.
I want more life, fucker.
Also you're too valuable to experiment with.
If it wouldn't be too much of a bother... a little bite to eat would be...
Why are you staring at us?
You could help us.
Industrial refuse.
She was gonna get away.
Four years.  Which would make her termination date...
I think I have no money.
Thank you very much.
I'm great.  I mean, I know I'm not really great, but I feel just great.  How you like my new suit?
I'd like  you to take a look at these pictures.
Lots of places.  The tours, the clubs, the Silicone shows, private parties.
There's been reports of management sexually abusing the artists in this place.
I can imagine.
I told you I'd come back.
You did?
Where is he?
What?
Have you ever cleaned your apartment?
This feels stupid.
Don't you think anything that can suffer deserves to be considered?
You know where I been.  I been on vacation.
You're not responding to the stimulus.  I can see right here, I'm not getting a reading.
I kinda get nervous when I take tests.
Doesn't make any difference what desert -- it's completely hypothetical.
How come you were in my truck?
You want to go home?
Where are your folks?
You look... better.
Beautiful.
What's that?
Ah, you get hold of your friends?
What makes you think so?
Come where?
Thank you very much. But, Cliff, that's my seat. And I was just--
Please excuse this interruption.
Yes! Yes! The Holiday Inn! That's exactly right!
I'm sorry!  I said something wrong, didn't I!  Please forgive me!
I don't have to take a physical in your space ship?
So...Mister Andretti, your first time on the freeway?
Hey, what are you doing?!
Troy? Is he your husband? Or a boyfriend?
Hey, no kidding?  In color?
Why not go to work for me?
How long would you need me?
They like Dr. Pepper.
Wait! Wait!
No problem.  We'll just sell another baseball card.
Why?!
One who's not a mutant.
Two weeks.
Yes, ma'am!
Yes!
Why, thank you!  Very nice to have met you, Cliff!  May I ask you a question?
Hey, Eve!
Hey, screw you! Okay? You think I'm just somebody you can buy off! Listen, let me tell you something--
I thought I was here to meet women.
Adam!  She's got bitch written all over her!  You do know what "bitch" means, don't you?
You're not from Alaska!  Where'd you learn to dance like that?!  And there are no starving people, are there?!
You think I'm some sort of sap?! Don't you?!
Look! I'm limping!  How attractive is that?!  What if this is for life?!
Is that what you call it?
And I think better than the ocean. I'm serious!
What?
Ooooohhhh!!  Of course! The father! Forgive me!!  Can you forgive me for my wasted life?!  Everything has been so awful!!
It's my entire baseball collection. It's yours now.
Like a painting?
The nocturnal flying mammal?
Why?
I promise. Is that all?
You're sure?
What? Did the politburo just one day say - "We give up?"
It's so small.
Not on him.
The recovery? Oh , yeah! Hey, they rebuilt the freeway in six months.
How 'bout we check with Eve first?
I know what you mean!  I usually wear a big hat and dark glasses.
Does that work?
Bye, Adam!
Of what?
You don't look thirty-five.
I guess living up here makes people look older.
Come on. Frozen. How much are they?
Then I'll need, twelve into nine hundred, seventy-five boxes. And that's almost...five hundred dollars just for the hamburger! And my Mom only gave me three thousand dollars for everything! The yacht batteries! The diesel oil! The birthday candles!
Whatcha looking at?
How do you do, ma'am.
I don't know how far you'll have to travel to find supplies, but if you can't get home by nightfall, I want you to look for something called a Holiday Inn. Write that down. It's a hotel. There might still be one standing.
No, I can't have that! They'll come with their cars and their guns and their handcuffs--
According to Caltech, this Webber guy was a bonafide genius and a borderline nutcase.
He drank it hot?
But, what if I go into labor? That could happen any time.
What's that noise?
The locks?
I'm not hungry.
Maybe I've just got the creeps.
Calvin!
Yes...
In the generator room again?
He's smart.
Always good advice.
Are you kidding?!  You wouldn't even be a crumb on her table!  You don't see that?!
Hey, you're the psychic. Eve, the psychic pimp.  You tell me.
In the first place, I don't fall in love with weirdos I've only known for four or five days.
He thinks that I am a gentleman and that you are a lady!
What's wrong?
I don't know.  Everything's so neat. It's all just so...goddamn dear.  Damn!
We came back to the house!
I miss those nice flower-power kids. How 'bout you?
Doctor Gynde, my whole family's sick. What's going on?
I've seen a few.
Fuckin' good, real fuckin' good. You know this little tid bit, Dorothy, and this thing, here,  is a neighbor. What the shit we're doin' with a neighbor, I don't know. Goddam!!!  This is the suavest guy I know. Look at you. You're one beautiful fucker, Ben. I love this jacket and that cigarette holder of yours. Shit, that is too fuckin' much. Where's those glasses. This beer's gonna get too warm. I can't stand fuckin' warm beer. It makes me puke.
See you Tuesday, Frank.
Anything you can tell me?
Why do you do it?
What color is it?
Because of your information I alerted internal affairs to check out Detective Gordon. I had to keep on with him as if nothing was different. He slipped off on his own when he found out we were going to raid Frank's place.
Jeffrey. Jeffrey what?
Don't.  I don't like that. What do you want?
Sure I'm alright. 
Thank you. honey.
Yes.
It's a secret so don't tell anyone. Some day I'll show you where. I've gotta go to sleep now.
I looked for you in my closet tonight.  It's crazy, I don't know where you came from, but I like you.
I liked being with you last night.
There you go again. Stop saying that. You can make it.
Who is Don?
I'm not crazy.  I know the difference between right and wrong.
No. I told you. I don't want to hurt you. I want to help you. I think I know some of what is happening to you.  Dorothy? Frank has your husband and son. Dorothy? Doesn't he? You have to do something Dorothy. Go to the police.
There's no disease, I can tell you.
They hurt his head.
Hold me, Don.
MOMMY!
Look at these. What are these?
We're going to leave that up to Detective Williams. I'll tell you though, you're okay. You shot a real son of a bitch.
Raymond! Where's the fuckin' beer?
What time are visiting hours?
Well. Okay.
What?
I'm going out for awhile.
No, I'm just gonna walk around.
Oh, yes, Jeffrey. Come in. He'll be back any minute now. You're welcome to wait. Is it urgent?
Please excuse me a moment, Jeffrey, and I'll get to the dishes.
What else is new? Right?
I'm home from school. My father's in the hospital.
Still, it must be kinda rough.
What happened to him?
Now, how are you going to do that?
No. I only saw his back. He went down another stairwell at the end of the hall.
Okay, yeah, call.
Well, how did it go? What happened?
That's what I thought.
So are you.  I mean you're a neat guy. We better get back.
Oh yeah?
Number two. I saw the Yellow Man come out. This time with a well- dressed man with an alligator briefcase. They drove down this factory building and stood on a staircase looking at something in the distance. Number three. Now get this. In the distance was a murder. A drug dealer shot to death and a woman with her legs broken.
I'm seeing something that was always hidden. I'm involved in a mystery. I'm learning. And it's all secret.
You like mysteries that much?
Yeah. I think so. I just had to tell him some of what I knew. Is Friday still on?
Nothing, really! It's good to see you.
Let's wait for some slow one.
My father has a gun at home.
Dorothy Vallens?
Probably not. No. Why?
What are watchin' this junk for?
Come on out a minute, okay?
Well he's the one shooting up all his guys, right? He's scared of the kid. Says he's real good, got every available gun in the city up there.
Are ya ready?
I can't find the second one, sir.
Shit. She's on every drug know to man. She'd have sold that thing for a dime bag. Screw her.  But I do kinda feel like an ass-hole.
What?
No, no. That's just not the way things are done. Besides, how's he know I don't just get in there see there's too many and just serve em their fuckin' food and beat it?
Yeah, well...
Forget it. It's a family prayer. My father, his father before him that sort of shit.
Shit.
They got nothing.
Hello.
Is that worthless brother of your there? I want you both ta hear this.
I want ta tell ya one last thing before I pull the trigger.
What... the dirty bitch! I hope ya trounced her a good one!
We... met them last night.
We paid attention in school.
We're alive.
Fuck!
How many feminists does it take to screw in a light bulb?
Aaaww, shit!... evil woman!
"We just got up and left. Bum musta rolled them before the police got there."
Me too. That's stupid. Name one thing we're gonna need it for.
Is that right, Rambo?
Where the fuck are you going?
Asshole!? I'm not the rope-totin' Charlie Bronson wanna-be that's getting' us lost!
We do not want your tired and sick.
Rule of thumb?
Uh... two shooters!
She was in here when it went down.
Can she I.D. them?
No! Fuck you! You start getting excited! We gotta fucking go!
That's a possibility. Y'know you Boston cops are perking up. That's two sound theories in one day, neither of which deal with abnormally sized men.  Another possibility is that they were placed there with religious intent.
Yeah. Some cultures still put pennies in the eyes of the dead, or silver.
These two fucking scenes are related. Too many coincidences. Same day? Five hours apart? Dead mobsters on both scenes. Now, why did he kill the bartender?
Who the...
Why do you always disrespect me like that?
They weren't related. The guy used a 38. No pennies. Totally amateur.
Oh my god!
Well fuck, you guys could do this every day.
Roc. You okay?
Roc. You okay?
I believe these young men are right.
Yes.
I'm sorry you're gonna hafta see this. Don't look at me!
Just be natural, goddamit.
Hey, Rocco, wait. Come back here.
The point is the killer always goes, May I speak to Starsky? He says his name.
He says. This is he.
She's really kind of hot.
But Dignan, do you really know that much about rare coins?
The list, Dignan. I know you remember the list because you signed it. "Things Dignan was not supposed to touch."
I'm lookout.
I don't think so. Just reach on in.
That sets it off.
You think we're going to be chased?
Holy shit.
What do you think?
Anthony, he sat in the car and watched a 4-11 in progress. He got what he deserved.
Why not?
See if mine are in there.
Dignan, those aren't running shoes.
Yes, they are.
What about them?
No, I'm not saying her. I'm just saying, I don't know.
Armored trucks are very difficult to steal, Anthony.
He needs to hire an attorney.
See, now we've got a plan.
He's gone. He stole the car.
That coward. Son of a bitch.
Well, I didn't do it, did I?
I understand that if I had a few more friends like you and Bob I'd be dead.
Why don't you come with us.
I don't think we can do that.
I don't know, Dignan. I just --
Don't panic, Anthony.
You gave $383 to the goddamn housekeeper! What the fuck is your problem?
What time did he say to be here?
Next week we'll be drinking pia coladas.
I don't think you will.
Do you like Inez?
You're all clear.
It's the fire alarm. Somebody pulled the fire alarm.
Wait for Kumar.
Dignan, it's too late.
What'd he get?
You think Applejack knew?
You're living on a sailboat?
It's hard to get much spin with this kind of paddle.
Look at that woman. She's what? Fifty? Fifty-five? But she hasn't let herself go. I appreciate an older woman who has a commitment to her body.
Sure, sure. He's a great person, and I'd call bullshit on anybody who said differently. But I wonder if the kid has the goods  up here.
What do you mean?
Exactly. Woah.
We're renegades from despair.
There's a million places to hide around here.
You think he got my license plates?
Bob, where you going?
I thought he didn't have to pay anything because of the technicality.
Where'd they come from?
That's your friend Anthony?
Yes. I did.
As much as I want. When these plants bud I'll probably have about six thousand dollars worth of weed.
What was that all about?
Well, don't blame me. I told you.
Hang on. This is important, Bob. Anthony and I are responsible for the internal situation. The money and the people. You're responsible for the external situation. The streets and the getaway.
Well, in reality it's not that dangerous, Bob. It's only dangerous if you don't know what you're doing.
It was an accidental. I don't want to go into the details. It was just one of those senior pranks that didn't really go right. I mean, obviously, since Swifty's dead. That's why Anthony never graduated.
What are you doing?
What happened?
Was Dignan screaming like, Get me a bag!
That's true. That would give me nightmares.
I'm sure he did. We'll have to get new plates.
I don't think they can make it stick, Bob. I mean, what do they actually have on Future Man?
They also found my two beam scale in the garage.
I'm going back.
I can't do that, Bob.
Dignan. You're going to give me those keys or you're going to get hurt.
What's his name?
Right. It was extremely stupid.
I never agreed to that.
Scarecrow?
Is he breathing?
Do they let you --
Here we go.
I'm working on it.
I might have mentioned it.
No, my friend knows her.
The world needs dreamers, son.
I'll say. You killed his goddam girlfriend instead. Now they're onto Neski. They're at the Brecker Hotel even as we speak.
What do you mean?
Let's talk about Conklin.
...this is Conklin's computer.
What's definitive, is that I just lost two people in Berlin!
Don't know.
Sit down.
'Why' would be enough for me.
And?
Yes...
YOU'RE A LIAR!
So why didn't you kill me then?
-- what? --
Where were you, Jason? In the car.
You are better. And I think it's not memories at all. It's just a dream you keep having over and over.
He was at the campground yesterday.
No. Not this. This is real.  And he's right there... 
-- where's left to go? --
You drive.
-- yeah -- one guy -- I don't think he was ready --
How do they know that? How can they know any of that?
Abbott?
What do you mean?
Your first assignment was Geneva.
What's that?
This is everything? Is there.
What do you want from me? I was reassigned. I'm out.
And why is that?
What do you think? Is he coming in?
What it means in England -- and in Scotland too -- is that rebels have forfeited their lands. We were ambushed last night. But the Scots dragged their dead away.
We'll sleep here tonight. You'll come home with me. We'll let the house, and the lands too; plenty of willing neighbors.
Did the priest say anything about the Resurrection? Or was it all about Judgment?
I will invade England. And defeat the English on their own ground.
A thousand.  You have made me Guardian of Scotland. So I tell you this is what we face.
So let the council swear publicly.
His legend grows! It will be worse than before!
You directed me to report to you the moment the king's conference was ended.
Yes. I had thought that... I was loathsome to you. Perhaps I am. If I may be excused, M'lord.
Good day to you, M'Lords.
Is it true? Wallace is captured?
You know it's a trap.
I wanna have supper waitin'.
Test of manhood.
Can you do it when it matters? As it matters in battle? Could you crush a man with that throw?
I am the one who is rotting. But I think your face looks graver than mine.
So more men were slaughtered uselessly!
In my heart I had begun to hope that he would never break.
My son's loyal wife returns, unkilled by the heathen. So he accepted our bribe.
You've been here before?
Did God make you the sacker of peaceful cities? The executioner of the king's nephew, my husband's own cousin?
York was the staging point for every invasion of my country. And that royal cousin hanged a hundred Scots, even women and children, from the city walls.
Why did you?
You have... you have a husband.
M'lady... what kindness of you to visit a stranger.
You will die! It will be awful!
I must... consult with my father.
What's the crazy man saying, Lord?
And you say he doesn't remember any of it?
Unfortunately, we've got nothing to work with. It's harder playing detective now.
But he's seven. What kind of stress can he have?
When did you ever care about getting to school on time?
Darn it!
Please, mom. People will talk.
I don't know. These things take time.
There must be a way to fix this.
You're. Acting. Like your father.
How. Did you. Know that?
Best not bitch up. Wind up someone's luggage that way.
So when I'm out, I need you to watch my face and hands closely.
Where are you now?
This is where we're finding most of the hemorrhaging. The outer lining of the cerebral cortex.
Think Evan. You've invented a disease that doesn't exist. Alternate universes with colleges, prisons, paraplegia...
Oh, comme si, comme ca, you know...
Well, lately some of the memories have begun to come back and I'd kinda like to talk to you about one of them in particular. It'd be a big help.
It was a long time ago.
You can't hate yourself just because your dad's a twisted freak.
Jesus, Kayleigh, you're...  Incredible.
What do you think it is about us that makes us so perfect? Like, looking back, whatever gave you the nerve to sneak out and visit me after I moved away?
Wait. Something's not right. Isn't that your jacket?
What's happened to you?
Why's that?
Different? How?
Yeah?
Don't think I'll need it where I'm going.
I don't get it.
Then you think it might have worked out?
Quit acting like some retard or I'll call your mother and tell her what a naughty little shit you've been.
Damn, Evan, on the D.L.
Remember, everyone! Only two weeks until your science projects are due.
Can... can... Can I have this?
Destroy it?
Leave us alone you sick fuck!
It wasn't enough that the whole world loves you, but you had to take away the last person on earth who didn't think I was a piece of shit.
Just get out, didja?
Monsieur Rick?
Monsieur Rick, what kind of man is Captain Renault?
Oh, yes, please.
Such a bargain. But that is your decision?
Mr. Berger, the ring, could I see it again?
Yes, Monsieur.
How long can I afford to stay closed?
What do you want for Sam?
Suppose we ask Sam. Maybe he'd like to make a change.
Ah, to get out of Casablanca and go to America! You're a lucky man.
Hmmm. I happen to know that he gets ten percent. But he's worth twenty- five.
Of course they stay. Rick's wouldn't be Rick's without them.
And Mademoiselle?
Mademoiselle, after this disturbance it is not safe for Laszlo to stay in Casablanca.
This morning you implied it was not safe for him to leave Casablanca.
Not an easy day to forget.
There's still nobody in the world who can play "As Time Goes By" like Sam.
Why there is no other man in my life?
Uh huh.
Was that cannon fire, or is it my heart pounding?
Strange. I know so very little about you.
But be serious, darling. You are in danger and you must leave Paris.
No, no, no, no. We must leave.
No. No, Rick. Not tonight.
Please.
Can I tell you a story, Rick?
Why not? After all, I got stuck with a railway ticket. I think I'm entitled to know.
Please.
You can ask any price you want, but you must give me those letters.
No. Oh, Richard, I'm sorry. I'm sorry, but, but you, you are our last hope. If you don't help us, Victor Laszlo will die in Casablanca.
No, not yet.
No, Richard, no. What has happened to you? Last night we said --
You are very kind.
-- Yes?
Be careful.
Captain, the boy who is playing the piano, somewhere I have seen him.
He came from Paris with Rick.
Rick? Who's he?
I can't get over you two. She was asking about you earlier, Rick, in a way that made me extremely jealous.
Thank you. I try.
Are you enough of a businessman to appreciate an offer of a hundred thousand francs?
There is. I suggest that you ask your wife.
Don't you sometimes wonder if it's worth all this? I mean what you're fighting for?
We might as well question why we breathe. If we stop breathing, we'll die. If we stop fighting our enemies, the world will die.
You seem to know all about my destiny.
Keep it. You'll need it in America.
Oh, never mind about that. You won't have any trouble in Lisbon, will you?
All except one thing. There's something you should know before you leave.
Merely to welcome you to Casablanca and wish you a pleasant stay. It is not often we have so distinguished a visitor.
My bill.
That's strange. Nobody is supposed to sleep well in Casablanca.
Monsieur, insofar as it is in my power --
Even in Berlin.
You may find the climate of Casablanca a trifle warm, Major.
Rick, this is Major Heinrich Strasser of the Third Reich.
Well, personally, Major, I will take what comes.
Rick is completely neutral about everything. And that takes in the field of women, too.
Captain Renault, are you entirely certain which side you're on?
I have no conviction, if that's what you mean. I blow with the wind, and the prevailing wind happens to be from Vichy.
Why do you stand here? Why don't you stop him?
What, again?
How observant you are. As a matter of fact, I wanted to give you a word of advice.
-- Stop it. He escaped from a concentration camp and the Nazis have been chasing him all over Europe.
Is that a serious offer?
Maybe he's not quite as romantic as you are.
Well, you were asking about Rick and here he is. Mademoiselle, may I present --
Oh, it's my party.
Huh?
I see. How do I know you'll keep your end of the bargain?
I suppose you know this isn't going to be pleasant for either of us, especially for you. I'll have to arrest you of course.
Our expenses?
What is your nationality?
Well, what makes you think I haven't?
Oh, nothing. But when you first came to Casablanca, I thought --
They got a lucky break. Yesterday they were just two German clerks. Today they're the 'Honored Dead'.
I forgot. You never drink with...  I'll have another, please.  You despise me, don't you?
But think of all the poor devils who cannot meet Renault's price. I get it for them for half. Is that so parasitic?
Perhaps an hour, perhaps a little longer.
Rick! Rick, help me!
He'll double what I pay you.
If she can stand it, I can. Play it!
No.
The sea is lovely, dark and deep.
Grow up, stop being such a baby.  Other people get through a lot worse.
You know what happened to this?
Yeah.  A long time ago.
Oh?  You've tried?
Do you...have any more packages to deliver?
Keep painting.  Promise me.
What brings you out to the sticks?
Had a package to deliver.
I've got lots of time.
My last chapter's in there, and the damn machine's jammed.
Cold.
You don't seem too happy about it.
Hey, look at you.
I have to.
Could you watch Jango?
It's our dog.  It belongs to us.
A week, max.  Okay?  Okay?
I got married.
Your calendar, your cell phone, your whoo pig sooey hat, some pictures of that ketch you wanted.
That about sums it up.
The plane went down.  My friends died.  I washed up on an island.  Then I found these barrels, built the raft, and here I am.
Come on.  Try.
It means a lot...that you came.
The regular flight is scheduled for oh three hundred tomorrow.
Which I didn't have.
I am one lucky guy.
I used to drive one of those.  A long time ago.
Doing great, Mom, don't worry about me.
Trying.
Hmmm.  Durango, Colorado; Asheville, North Carolina, then...canceled her account.
Can you find her?
I'm touched.
The point of FedEx, as I understand it, is to make the damn connection.
I was making a point.
You are one sick fucker.
I braided them.
To Wilson.
To life.  Fuck 'em if they can't take a joke.
That's all there is.
That's what it's about.
I need to do it.
Only if you can afford it.
Wilbur, the adopting couple is waiting in your office.
"An internship and two years of training at the Boston Lying-in, South End Branch. For his age, he was judged an accomplished gynecological obstetrical surgeon; he is also experienced in pediatric care..."
You cook very well!
Homer, you know I would never kill anyone--you know I wouldn't.
Yes. But it's closed all the time now, because of the blackout.
I miss things. I miss... people.  I miss reading to the boys.
Sometimes... movies mostly bore Wally.
Aren't you worried that people will cut their feet?
I *know* this was right.
We should take her to St. Cloud's. That much is obvious, isn't it? Let her make up her mind when she gets there...
Well, we can't force her. It's her decision.
Stop it! Just cut it out!
So many children. Are they all orphans?
They wanted a girl.
Nobody's asked for me, have they?
You mean they'll replace you with someone who won't perform abortions.
Cirrhosis--it's a disease of the liver.
*Alcohol* killed him--he drank himself to death.
Did you know your mother better?
No. She was an immigrant.
I wonder if you might give me a ride.
This is all normal. Don't worry. The abortion procedure... it affects you. It's the ether, too. It'll take a little time.
I don't *have* any time. There's a *war*!
Slow down, Homer--don't be in such a big hurry.
Merthiolate, ether, vulval pads, gauze--lots of gauze.
Yes, for both.
If you take enough of it, your intestines lose their ability to absorb Vitamin C.
Okay, he's just a Wilbur then.
I'm happy I amuse you.
Try to look at it this way. What choice does Buster have? What are his options? Nobody will ever adopt him. 
Doubtless you'll let me know what immensely worthwhile or at least *useful* thing it is that you find to do.
In other parts of the world, I suppose there are other ways.
Mrs. Worthington, I feel I'm very lucky to be here.
"One: Please don't smoke in bed."
You okay, Rose?
That just ain't right, Jack--your cigarette's gonna end up in nine or ten gallons of this batch of cider! That ain't right.
I fail to see how someone courageous enough to make a commitment to a foreign mission is automatically to be dismissed--that part of the world requires precisely the kind of dedication that is needed here.
Tell that Vernon to mind his own business, Muddy.
Brutal day. They say the streets are lined with money down here, but I guess you have to know the secret handshake. What are you drinking?
Can --
Don't tell me you started a tech firm here before us.
We know exactly how we're going to make the money back. There in lies the Catch-22
Listen, what I'm about to tell you, I'm telling you in confidence, okay?  Have you ever heard of a company called Big.Com?
Big.Com. That Internet thing.
And I think it's because of this redhead...
So much for honor among thieves. You would have cut loose your friends, your girl...
It's not true.
Oh, Jake. You disappoint me. And you just let Lily here down again. What was it you said about playing the big con?
I think so. The airport's going to be crawling with police. Traffic will be a nightmare. Go down to the bar. If they pull it off, great. Have someone deal with Ashby.
I'm going home
We only owe the King a hundred and fifty.
I need you to stake me.
Something stupid.
Of course. Jake. Nice to see you.
Oh Jesus!
Uh-huh.
For what? A couple hundred bucks?
I'm your basic underachiever. Can't stand working and porn doesn't seem like a good option.
We were friends. I trusted him. I should have known it was weird. But, then again I was weird.
What about what?
I was supposed to meet him for breakfast. He likes that new IHOP they just opened, you know... He likes to order that thing. The Rutti- Tutti-Fresh and Fruity thing they got.
I'm just thinking out loud here, but... Two million in a briefcase?
Yeah, or D, it's a dumb fucking idea...
Then what do you want to do, Miles? Run?
We're getting a little old for running.
But if you wanna talk about bad luck...
Do you have a ticket?
My fucking heart bleeds.
What'd he say?
You really like that bitch don't you? I gotta tell you, I was pretty convinced that the whole thing before was blowing her off for her cut. You know how it is, get her to do some shit for you, throw her a bang to keep her happy. But, if you're into her... That's cool.
Sorry. What?
A Fed? Is he close?
I think so. What'd he ever do to you anyway?
What do you want?
This guy must have been a real pain in your dick.
Maybe another time.
I'll take you up on that.
You called the casino a cesspit.
The Indian rope-trick.
Not like Matt, you mean.
Look Bella, I don't know anything about this. You should talk to Matt.
Who was he?
She had to leave early. She asked me to thank you.
You shouldn't have done that. I know what it meant to you.
What's the time?
You're my conscience.
I don't finish till eight. Make it nine and you're on.
Oh really. Then why is he called Jake. Why don't you come clean and call him Jack.  There's no hope in it.
-- I don't care about her. Of course, I was angry. But not with you. The book is yours not mine. I was wrong, what I said about it. I hurt you, didn't I?
Here...use a spoon.
No.
So how are you doing, dad?
Great. I've just started a new company. Solid financing. It's good.  I love you Jacko, you know that
I've lived there.
No, no. I come every couple of years. I always think I'm going to stay. I'm from Cape Town originally
Absolutely not.
I'm in trouble.
I owe a lot of money.
I know that. But you can now.
The point is, they want a man inside.
You're serious.
It won't.
I can't do it, Jani.
What for?
Is it yes?
Well, life's not fair. We know that.
Of course I recognised him!
Nice car. How much did you pay for it?
Where to?
Because if a supervisor knew I'd seen you and I hadn't reported it, I'd lose my job as well. And I can't afford that.
You're talking about complicity.
I'm off. I need to sleep.
Loosen up, Jack. If you don't, this job'll get to you. The pressure's too much, believe me, it'll break you.
I'd like to buy you a drink.
Wait a minute. You got yourself barred.
You've been recommended by the management here. They know your father. He has a bit of a reputation, hasn't he?
Haven't you forgotten something?
I don't think so.
Five.
You want me to check?
Does he win?
I have a reduced drive reading of seven thousand.
I hope it's not the oven again.
The key!
Key? Key? What is the key?
No, no, the key, the key to the fail- safe lock!
Where is the key?
Oh, God...
What the hell?
Armed.
Are you willing to entertain a few concepts?
My sensory apparatus reveals it to me.
And you can only do it once, right?
And you wouldn't want to explode on the basis of false data, would you?
...nine seconds...
-- open circuit breakers --
I'm getting something here, on this readout...
Don't worry about it. We'll find out when it goes bad.
Ah, Lieutenant Doolittle? Sir?
When you fall, Doolittle, if there's anyone down there on the planet, somebody may see you. They may see you coming down. What a beautiful way to die... as a falling star...
No kidding?
I'm glad you've come to talk with me, Doolittle. It's been so long since anyone has come to talk with me.
Tell me, Doolittle, how are the Dodgers doing?
Sorry.
Man, you got a bad attitude.
Call the skank now or I start redecorating.
Some of us are trying to sleep.
Move it.
Same old story.  Not interested.
I made you coffee.  That oughta help you cope with the injustice of the world a little.
You have good taste.  French, 1920's, attributed to Chitarus.
Lemme get my coat.
Now you know who I am, where I live.  I figured I better find out who I'm dealing with in case you were looking to hurt me.
Too early to tell.
Bent?
You make it sound I pawed through your priceless collection of underwear.
How'm I s'posed to ever sleep there again knowing some pervo's probably touched everything I own?
You lost me.
I remember fine.  I just didn't understand what was going on.  They never told us anything except what to do.  It took me a long time afterwards to figure things out.
How much do you know?
So, you know the lengths he'll go to keep her from going public... I'm turning Lauren over to Canadian law enforcement tomorrow.  They'll put her in witness protection, but if you're with her the risk of her safety goes way down.
She's put her life on the line, and her faith in me.
Forty-seven people drowned last night off the coast of Vancouver after paying smugglers twenty thousand apiece to get into Canada so they could get work in order to eat.  Only they got marched overboard at gunpoint instead.
Know where I can find her?
Who is it?
Who are you?
I thought it was important for you to know the facts.
Well, it's over between you and him. We're getting married next month.
Who's this guy?  This isn't who we're looking for...her name was Hannah.
They don't exactly have a search engine for finding a bunch of kids with bar- codes on their necks, which is something I'm not even going to ask about--
How's this about me?
One-seven-four-nine-five Natoma.
You're way more philosophical than I could ever be.
Tell me the truth.  Am I a female fog bank?
If I knew what you were saying, I wouldn't be asking.
A fog bank.
You're actually gonna bail Sketchy out.
And because I actually kinda feel sorry for guys sometimes.
They don't have a lot of moving parts.
Look, you're a player... I'm bringing you this on a plate, and my fee is just the normal cost of doing business.
She's got my word.
Max--
Lydia.
And why should she?
She came by the apartment once already. Fortunately, I'd disconnected the doorbell as a precaution... Lydia's not gonna back off until she gets her pound of flesh.
And he loves you back, doesn't he?
Oh, Dicky, I c-c-can't...
Beth? I can't believe it.
I didn't mean for that to be so... intense. Forgive me.
I dunno. I think he had the piece of skin under his tongue removed so he could stick it out farther. I'm not too up on Gene trivia.
Coming dad.  I'll call you. Soon as we get a phone. Bye.
What's it worth to you?
Oh, God, how calculating of me to lead you all on like that after you offered me a ride in the middle of nowhere.
What are you, high?
Well, the least we, his only buds in the world, can do is take him along with us tonight and give him one last curl before he starts serving his sentence.
Just for the record, I understood the last part of what you said, but for a while there you guys were making no fucking sense whatsoever.
I have one question. How could a kid who wails on the drums like it's the only thing keeping him alive even think of such a femmy thing to say?
Second floor girls' john! Two minutes! He'll never look there!
That's Sherry VanHafton.
Ok, dudes, follow my lead.
...I mean, my mom's got insurance. What's the worst thing she could do? Ground me for the entire year? I can handle that...
Ahh, sunshine.
It's dirty laundry for one thing and for another, you still haven't worn the clothes I bought you. You're skating on thin ice already, young man, so I wouldn't push my luck. Now get out of those rags.
I made an appointment with Father Phillip McNulty at St. Bernard's. We're to see him directly where he will register you on the spot.
Mom, what're we...?
Yeah.
Okay, you better have something really sinful for me this time, son. My patience is worn to threads and your mom will be here any minute.
A bustier?
Well, here we are back at fucking school again.
But we took the keys?
What do you want?
Oh, yeah! You and what army?
I don't even think you have a gun!
Simple Simon on the Rock, go caller.
What was his name?
Donnie.
-- and be able to find one of these wormholes.
When you fall asleep tonight, I'm gonna fart in your face.
Where are you going?
Babies cry because they're afraid of the dark. And because they have no memories... for all they know... every night could be the last forever. Like, perpetual darkness.
That's not good enough. You've got to go back in time and take all those hours of darkness and pain and replace them... with whatever you wanted.
With, like, images?
We're moving through time.
Oh, yeah.  "The Philosophy of Time Travel". What is this?
My mom is gone.
What?
Come with me.
Grandma Death.
How does it feel to have a wacko for a son?
Would you like to talk about this friend?
I think he saved my life.
I don't own a television.
Follow him where?
I met a girl.
Do you think a lot about girls?
Who is the boss?
What about your family, Donnie?
How many times have you seen Frank?
Can anyone else see him?
I don't know. Gretchen has a theory. That Frank is a sign. I told her I thought it was ridiculous.
Do you wish that you were punished by your parents instead?
How did you feel... being denied those Hungry Hungry Hippos?
What else makes you feel regret?
Why?
What does time travel have to do with philosophy?
You're not gonna tell Mom, are you?
No I don't.  She worries about you.
Donnie is experiencing what is commonly called a daylight hallucination.
I haven't been accepted yet, mother.
Rose.
Rose, we have a crisis.  I am sure that you are aware of the horrible allegations against Jim Cunningham.
Yes, I saw the news. Something about a kiddie-porn dungeon.
Oh, Kitty, I don't know. This is so last-minute... Eddie is in New York...
Kitty...
Really?
Okay.
This came for you, sweetie.
Right by the airport -- Oh, Amber...
Loretta, don't do that.
Amber...
Go on! Get out!
Bye mom.
Mrs. Clark, why are you doing this to me? Why're you pretendin' you don't know what's goin' on?
Amber Atkins! That is not American Teen Princess language!
What're you doin' here?
So, uh, I -- I'm not really busy Friday. I just said that -- y'know.
You could be quiet.
Oh, naw. Hi.
Shut it up, Loretta.
That bitch from...
Wisconsin.
Can you remember the theme of your favorite pageant?
Gladys! Stop it!
That's enough!
I said I'd move if a cripple came. Let's just run in the store and pick out some outfits.
You know that sometimes it's hard to understand God's great plan.
Ow, Harold -- Mom said not the head.
From what I have been gathering, I think they think I should be king: I think they think I should be king!
King Solomon was game he gave each Girl his name to number them would make a list that long I'll bet his thousand wives led miserable lives if the king can do no wrong.
There's still something wrong with it... take out "President" ...now what've you got?
Yes, sir. 
Never mind His Excellency -- you gotta your pocketbook?
What's the matter with you?
Hey you!!
What kind of a dog is he?
I don't want him.
I'm sorry I'm not in.  I wanted to have a long talk with you...  Now look here, my good man, you've got to stop yelling "peanuts" in front of the House of Representatives.
You don't want to be a public nuisance, do you?
You wouldn't consider going over Niagara Falls without a barrel?
Let's see -- What've I got in my cabinet besides mice --  I've got it -- how would you like to be Secretary of the Interior?
Well, if you wanna work in the post- office you'll have to stick out your tongue.
Why wasn't I insulted?
Fine.  We gotta him. 
So! -- He's on your side, too.
Well, in the meantime, could you let me have $50 personally?
Yes.
Was it -- swine?
Your Excellency, the eyes of the world are upon you.  Notables from every land are gathered here in your honor --  This is a gala day for us.
Oh, Rufus!
But -
Ambassador Trentino, I am indeed honored...  But you see - well - I --
Maybe it's not going to be so easy. From what I've heard, Mrs. Teasdale is rather sweet on this Rufus T. Firefly.
I've always thought that myself.
Freddie?... Freddie, don't look so discouraged.
I shouldn't be. We made great progress today. I taught him to repeat a few basic phrases. He did rather well, too, but I had to lead him every step of the way. Though frankly, at times I was unsure of who was leading whom.
Perhaps you're just polishing a stone, endowing this Elephant Man with qualities he doesn't possess?
Our man is sick. Come right away.
Aw, Bytes, he's sick.
He's a clumsy git. Never watches where he is going.
You don't own this man!
Well sir, he's quite seriously deformed, and I fear the other patients would find him... rather shocking.
A few words? I thought he was imbecile?
Well sir, perhaps I should explain...
No, Treves, it's out of the question. Now if it was up to me, I'd say "Certainly, let's meet the fellow, by all means," I'm sorry, I simply can't speak for the other members of the committee.
Then will you meet him, as a representative of the committee.
Yes, I spoke to both the British Home and Royal Hospital for Incurables. I'm afraid that they weren't very encouraging, but they said they'd bring it up at their next committee meeting, so we should have their answers shortly.
Treves. Well done.
Don't we?
Has the response picked up?
I'm feeling very fit, thank you. How is your bronchitis?
I feel much better. Thank you.
Three quarters of an hour.
Abominable things these machines. One can't reason with them.
I say Freddie, what are you about?
Fair Katharine, and most fair, will you vouchsafe to teach a soldier terms Such as will enter at a lady's ear And plead his love-suit to her gentle heart?
Your majesty shall mock at me; I cannot speak your England.
Good day...!
Mr. Treves says that you are in the theatre. Do you live there?
Alas, no.
Of course! You want out?
Yes.
I'm sorry I could only get you a third class ticket, but it's all we had.
The main spire.
That's much better. I could understand that "yes".
Very good! Oh yes! Now listen. I'm going to say some things to you and I want you to repeat them... um... I want you to say them back to me. Do you understand? I'm going to say some things to you and I want you to say them back to me. Do you understand?
Yes.
John... Merrick
Say "Mmmerrick."
Why, my dear Mrs. Mothershead, how good of you to join us. Mr. Merrick, will you please introduce yourself?
Righteousness for his namesake.
Thank you very much.
Ohhh...
Good Lord, Mr. Treves!
YOU'RE NOT LISTENING TO ME! I ain't done nothing wrong. People pay to see your monster, Mr. Treves. I just take the money.
I'd pay handsomely for a private showing. Are you the proprietor?
Handsomely?... Who sent you?
She did, I tell you! She could blind me as easily as the night the day.
What... you mean "got into bed with" them?
What does that matter? But you've... you've... FELT like this before...
"The fifth one this week"!
Oh, for goodness' sake!
Five this week; how many the week before?
We mustn't let him land!
No. Don't look... The abyss will suck away your strength.
The second note.
I don't want to live WITHOUT you.
LOKI! Where did YOU come from?
And will the dead ever return, Freya?
You don't think our singing's going to be good enough for you?
Well, how d'you think I feel?
What?
About NOT raping you...
You DON'T like it, do you?
I didn't mean to!
You told them I raped you -- why?
Why should you care?
What's the point of being dead in the land of the living?
"But" what?
I know!
You talking piffle, son?
Slower! Nobody can row at that speed!
But you're the Gods!
Thank you VERY much indeed.
Leif, you sit there. Even, you sit there. Harald, you'd better sit over there...
That's better.
No! Let go, Snorri!
You'll be sucked down too!
You need to say a bit more than that!
What's the matter with them?
Well, what else do we do?
So Halfdan the Black's using magic, is he? Well, I have a magic to match his! 
Don't you see, Erik! She wants revenge!
Look, I bagged it last week.
Aaagh!
Well! Come on!
What are you doing, Keitel Blacksmith?
Get away, Snorri.
You just can't make enough swords and spears and knives and daggers to satisfy the demand. You could charge Halfdan twenty and he'd pay it.
Urrgh! Argh! Let go, you idiot!
It's a tradition.
You must only let the red rage take hold of you in the thick of battle.
I must KILL! Kill!
He drove me mad!
Thorfinn! You can't die!
And you've got BOTH axes?
Yes, Mum.
You weren't supposed to see that.
Thanks, guys.
I'm sorry Naomi couldn't make it. You okay? You seem quiet.
You were not.
I can't. I want to, but I have to study.
Oh, Tangerine.
Now. Now! I have to go now. I have to see the frozen Charles! Now! Tonight!
Well, I'm there. I hide in the back as much as is humanly possible. You have a cell phone? I need to quit right this minute. I'll call in dead.
Blue ruin is cheap gin in case you were wondering.
Huckleberry Hound! What, are you nuts?
Frost?
You just say. I'm not really --
Exactly. Exactly! That's exactly my feeling about it. It's hard to know. Like, okay, but how many times do I think something and it doesn't happen? That's what you're saying, right? You forget about those times. Right?
But I think I am. I like to think I am.
Sorry. My life isn't that interesting. I go to work. I go home. I don't know what to say.
Yeah.
I think so.
A wino? Jesus, Are you from the fifties? A wino!  Face it, Joel. You're freaked out because I was out late without you, and in your little wormy brain, you're trying to figure out, did she fuck someone tonight?
I want to have a baby.
Let's talk about it later.
You're drunk.
More?
What do you mean?
Don't call me Antoine. My name is Wally.
I want to enjoy my little time left with you.
Do you remember what we talked about?
I'm sure, I said.
But you weren't. I could tell.
Sorry to track you down like this. I'm not a stalker. But I needed to see you.
Well, you're married.
Okay.
I know.
Yeah, I know. I'm fishing.
No, I stopped. I didn't want to feel like I was being artificially modulated.
Do you know her poem that starts "Seaside gusts of wind,/And a house in which we don't live...
Tomorrow?
I think I should go back.
Oh, um...
I'm sorry. I just wanted to say that. This seems like the perfect romantic exotic place to do it and --
That's what it says. You drank too much, you picked on me for being passive and timid.
I don't know.
Did you send this? Is it a joke?
Your dried cum.
I might be making a mistake.
The thing is, Joel, whatever it is you think you have with this chick, once the thrill wears off, you're just going to be Joel with the same fucking problems.
You didn't miss much. Rob and Carrie say hello.
So you think the dissertation will get published?
It's just... y'know... I mean...
I know. Anyway --
Hey, if you're ordering lunch for Mierzwiak, would you --
We haven't checked.
Yup.
Don't you think Howard's like that? Smart? Important?
It's not erasing. He's off the screen.
I don't know! I just said that!
Do you remember anything else? What I was wearing? Was I standing close to him? Was I leaning against his car like I owned it? How did he look at me when I giggled? Tell me everything.
Nothing.
I don't know. I just -- there are a lot of really confused people showing up at the office.
Mary...
Yes?
Alexander Pope?
Do you love me? Did you love me? Something. I listened to my tape. I can't believe I've been sitting right in front of it for a year. It's like listening to someone else's story. I mean, I hear myself talking about having sex with you and I can't even imagine you naked. I can't even say "naked" to you!
You get some sleep, Howard. I'll take it from here.
I don't know what you're talking about, Howard.
Yeah?
Just wanted to let you know.
The thing is... my situation is a little weird. My girlfriend situation.
Mary hates me. I've never been popular with the ladies.
What do you believe in then?
How am I going to be the progenitor of a tribe when I'm living on an isolated ridgetop with Delores?
About being a cowgirl. What's it all about? When you say the word you make it sound like it was painted in radium on the side of a pearl.
That's Jellybean!
Ninety degrees to the left, I hope. How does she feel about you?
What do you think?
But I don't want you to leave. Please stay. We can go to dinner. I owe you a dinner. And tonight... we can... really make love.
I was the Yoni Yum feminine-hygiene Dew girl from 1965 to 1970, but got laid off.
Your ranch?
I can't be certain that you would. But what have you got to lose?
Holy shit...
...come on, Skipper, I already put my shoes on...
Captain Miller, we're ready to repressurize the Clark.
You been out there a long time. Trying to break my record?
Solid as a rock.  Hey, Smith...
The Event Horizon only had life support for eighteen months. It seems impossible, but in light of the transmission... I have to think that someone has managed to endure until now.
No, he didn't.
There must be a way! What about Engineering?
DJ. The Clark's gone. Smith and Cooper are dead.
Please... kill...
His peritoneum has ruptured...
Does he know that?
What, Justin, what shows you?
Oh my god OH MY GOD...
This is Weir.
I can understand your desire to redeem your reputation, Dr. Weir, but it doesn't factor into this.
Peters is right, no one's here.
Everything's been shut down. Conserving power, I guess. Green light on the hull, it's intact.
Justin, check the containment for radiation leaks. Peters...
I can run the image through a series of filters, try to clean it up.
I can see that, what're they for?
Easy, Peters, we're okay, we're okay. Let's finish the sweep.
It beats dying, Mister Smith.
Thermal changes in the hull could have caused the metal to expand and contract very suddenly, causing reverberations --
We're leaving.
What about my ship?
I told you... She won't let you leave...
...Make your approach vector negative fourteen degrees...
I guess we're about to find out. Keep us slow and steady.
Do we have enough time for a weld?
Where is it, where is it...
I just finished drying...
We can take the filters from the Clark...
Not acceptable. I want to know what's causing those readings. If the crew is dead, I want the bodies, I want the crew found.
Miller...
Tuck yourself into a crouched position, shut your eyes as tight as you can!
Weir.
Wasn't that ship destroyed?
Yes, we can see some kind of mist. What is that?
You got any coffee?
What the hell is that?
The safety circuit's failed!
If they are, they're screening their calls.
Get them back --
Relativity, yes. We can't break the law of relativity, but we can go around it. The ship doesn't really move faster than the speed of light; it creates a dimensional gateway that allows the ship to instantaneously "jump" from one point in the universe to another, light years away.
Could it be the crew? If they were in suspended animation, wouldn't that effect the scan?
Why Dr. Weir, I think you're in love.
It must be hard, being so far away from her.
What are you doing?
Those yours too?
You don't know what it's like out there. Walking around like some kind of circus freak. People staring, whispering --
I can only stay for one drink, Ben. I've got to meet with Victor.
Oh, he did.
Just give Reed a little more time. You know how he works -- analyzing every little step before he takes one --
What do you want, Vic?
He knew about NASA. What if he made the call to shut us down --
No. I cannot take orders from that underwear model. That wingnut washed out of NASA for sneaking two Victoria Secret wannabes into a flight simulator.
They crashed it into a wall. A flight simulator.
I don't know. I just keep going over and over the numbers.
You go through something like this, makes you appreciate having the right woman in your life.
Yeah.  You don't wanna know the details.
Ben, I'm afraid I've got to ask --
Ben --
Back on Earth. Victor's medical facility... We're in quarantine.
He's not responsive --
Back it down, Johnny!
Is there something about flames? About flaming, that you --
What is that thing?
I'm driving.
Johnny, slow down. Think. You know mom didn't raise us to --
What are you doing --
And if he's not...?
They're ready for you, sir.
Then what is it?
Get me on the AM shows, Larry King, cover of the Journal...  I've got to do something about this scar. Make sure they only shoot my right side.
Yes sir. You've got the Mayor at eight, then a nine-thirty interview with the Journal --
Well, uh, based on our history... you can handle the biogenetics, and I'll focus on the molecular physics. Or, uhm, maybe I should take the biotech, you work the microscopes, since you have some background in electropho--
I can tell you guys are enjoying what was the best part of our relationship --
Are you kidding?
If we can build a machine to re-create the storm, we can reverse the polarity --
Reed. How close are we to a cure?
Which is why I'm working twenty hours a day, checking every variable --
I could get Ben to tap into the Baxter's main power to generate enough voltage --
Funny how things turn out, isn't it?
Right, of course, the company... But you see, I've come to realize all the accomplishments in the world mean nothing without someone to share them with --
Victor, your scar --
If these molecules aren't stable, they could make us worse, maybe even kill us.
Brad, I really fuckin' hate McDonald's, man. Ever since they started in with the chicken, everything went downhill.
I can't do that. But if you wait a minute...
Look. Just put your little hand back in the cash register and give me my $2.75 back. Okay?  Please, Brad?
Brad! Have Mom or Dad seen this?
You are a virgin!
See you later.
Come on. Clean that counter off Brad. Let's go. Play ball.
You first.
Hey, Mike?
What's wrong?
I think I came. Didn't you feel it?
I didn't see you this morning.
We've got to get an abortion?
Half. Okay?  Seventy-five dollars. And a ride to the clinic.
All right... where did you see her?
She's in my biology class.
No. It's too soon.
Outrageous, Merv. Nice to be here. I feel great.
I was going to say... your eyes look a little red.
Naw. Any good?
My brother's car!
Will you just relax, mon? He's not gonna kill us. My father is a television repairman. He's got all kinds of tools. I can fix-this car.
Don't you like him?
Come on, Stacy, it's your section and your man.
He was hot, wasn't he?
I hear some surfer pulled a knife on Mr. Hand this morning.
Was it great?
I sent a letter to Doug today. I'll be so glad when he gets out here.
All right! Here's another one. 'The most satisfactory lovemaking occurs when your mate climaxes first, you climax first, you and your mate climax together?'
God, he hardly even talks anymore.
Stacy! I've got water in my ears. Do you have any Q-Tips?
That little prick.
I want romance.
He's not coming.
Dartmouth?!
There's a world of guys out there. I just wish I didn't have to date any of them.
Yes.
Yeah. The Graduation Dance Mr. Hand. It's the last school event of the year.
No way, mon. When I graduate U.S. history I ain't even coming over to your side of the building.
Where do you feel like going?
Is this your first time?
I think I'll have the Seafood Salad Special.
I had a really nice time tonight.
Where's your brother?
No. That's okay.
So... pretty nice house you've got here.
Do you really have to go?
What's April 16th?
Nobody noticed. Don't worry about it. We'll just stay out here until everyone comes out, we'll blend back in.
Hi, Stacy. How are you?
Yeah? About fifty people I didn't know wrote that in my annual.
Are you ready to order here?
Of course, I could hear what the Clerk was really saying...
What's the message? My light is blinking.
Mr. Duke? Hello, Mr. Duke, I'm sorry we were cut off a moment ago... I thought I should call again, because I was wondering...
They're everywhere. Nobody's safe. And sure as hell not in the South. They like warm weather... You'd never believe it. In L.A. it's out of control. First it was drugs, now it's witchcraft.
You're going to need to take the bull by the horns -- go to the mat with this scum.
Thanks for the ride. Thanks a lot. I like you guys. Don't worry about me.
What the fuck are we doing out here? Somebody call the police! We need help!
God didn't do that! You did it! You're a fucking narcotics agent, that was our cocaine, you pig!
Total control now. Tooling along the main drag on a Saturday night in Vegas, two good old boys in a fire apple red convertible... stoned, ripped, twisted... Good people!
How about "Nickel Nick's Slot Arcade?" "Hot Slots," that sounds heavy. Twenty- nine cent hotdogs...
Nonsense. We came here to find the American Dream, and now we're right in the vortex you want to quit. You must realize that we've found the Main Nerve.
Calm down. You'll be straight in a few hours.
Good God! Let's get out of here! Where's the elevator?
You're doomed. I'm leaving here in two hours and then they're going to come up here and beat the mortal shit out of you with big saps. Right there in that tub.
I want that fucking radio!
Lucy.
It's straight economics. This girl is a god-send. Shit, she can make us a grand a day.
NO! I felt sorry for the girl, I wanted to help her!
We have to cut her loose. She's got two hundred dollars. And we can always call the cops up there in Montana, where she lives, and turn her in.
Okay, Lucy, it's time to go meet Barbra...
Maybe we should take it easy tonight.
What could they do? The guy that took the head was about six-seven, and maybe three-hundred pounds. He was packing two Lugers, and the others had M-16s.
What's wrong with you? Hell, somebody has to do it.
Why not? We should get some of that. Just eat a big handful and see what happens.
Fuck the car. They should make these things with a goddamn FM radio.
I was stupid with shock -- not knowing whether to run or start laughing.
No! I can't get out! They'll crucify me. I'll have to take the blame!
Please... please... I'm only the maid. I didn't mean nothin!...
Could I have that, please?
Yeah. I know. I'm guilty. I understand that. I knew it was a crime but I did it anyway. Shit, why argue? I'm a fucking criminal.
What?
It serves you right. You cheatin' jerk.
Spare me.
Stop!
You know where it is?
We'll meet in three hours?
One keg of Beast for the basement, then, truck's dry.
Hey! Get quiet or get out.
I think I know where a CB is.
It's in the basement, about a hundred yards long. It spits out on the backside of that hill down the way. There's a truck there.
Why do you take shit from him?
Oh.
What is this?
Go for it. It's by the far wall. A small wave band. Channel 9 is the emergency frequency. But I don't see the point.
Covered.
Seven.
Look, the armed surround the unarmed in a circle and we move as a tight group. Those that can shoot, protect the rest to his ride.
Blow the goddamn hatch!
I'm in a wheelchair, the truck sounds pretty good.
Do we have anything else to defend ourselves with? Anything?
Shut up! Shut your mouth. You have no idea what is running through me right now. No idea.  I'm ready.
We all have to be strong, right?
What have you done now, broke the darn thing?
But we've been at it since six this morning. At least you could've let me go home and change.
No, I'm concerned with everything.
Huh.
Get your clothes on, lady --
Without me.
Dick, I can't even breathe here...
Dwayne! I'm Dwayne now! And you damn well better get used to it!
Listen to yourself, Frances. The resistance, the anger in your voice.
Yes, yes, it's all arranged. Everyone's collecting subscriptions in your name. And the best part is: the trip returns you to New York.
...until finally your mother finds it necessary to commit you to a state mental institution. Were you mentally ill, Frances?
Bye, baby.
He talked to me today. Told me to keep my mouth shut or I'd get everybody in trouble.
Is Kaminski a Communist?
If I didn't, I wouldn't put you through it.
Bread?
I have a right to talk to her. She's my daughter, and she's beginning to understand why I've sacrificed so much in order to achieve...
You've sacrificed?! If you'd practice law for decent folk instead of Communists and indigents --
They need help, Lil. They pay me back in other ways.
See you next weekend?
Oh, Kurt!
Name?
I wouldn't miss it.
Are you really serious? About acting?
You sound as if you hate it.
Yeah. Well if you didn't put it in the papers -- nobody'd even know about it.
Now wait a minute, sweetie. Do I look like a newshound to you?
Oh yeah! I saw you in the newsreel!
You know, my Dad's done some work for Kaminski...
Well... see the papers've got us pegged as pinkos, then you come along, the friendly neighborhood atheist --
Well... I'll give it a try, Mr. York.
I don't know... I did... feel different... Alive.
What?
You know, my old man was an inventor. Spent his whole life down in the basement trying to design transcontinental underground railroads, stuff like that. Well, I was supposed to be his partner. When I told him the smell of his workshop made me sick, I thought he was going to die right there.
I don't know, Harry. I... I want so many...
Well, the studio told me not to.
Tell you what. Let's ditch the limo. Let me drive you up to that red carpet in my beat up Chevy.
The chauffeur. He's watching.
I'll bet.
No, Harry, I can't -- 
Hey! Another shot for the lady and a double for me!
Why are you always leaving me, Harry?
Where to?
Right. Except... time has a way of --
C'mere. I want to talk to you.
I got a new car. Only it's red. Did you know Mama died?
Have you reported to your Probation Officer as directed?
You're on your way to a contempt citation, young lady.
Who're you?
'But how do I know you love me?'
'How do I know it's true? You'll get to be the champ. They'll all want you, all the girls! But I don't care. I've been undersea a long time. When they'd put their hands on me I used to say, "This isn't it! This isn't what I mean!" It's been a mysterious world for me! But Joe, I think you're it! I don't know why, I think you're it. Take me home with you.'
The speech? Real good.
Don't listen to him, little sister. When you're proud of what you are, you don't refuse the label, understand?
You kill me, Mama.
What's wrong?
I'll have lunch ready by one.
Oh Frances, do I have news for you! Guess who --
I'm going out!
You're not going anywhere!
Yes, I am, and you can't stop me! You can't tell me what to do, mother. I'm a grown woman, and I can decide about my own life.
Oh, just leave those things for now.
I was hoping for a kind word, little sister.
You were hoping for a kind word?! You're my mother! You're supposed to nourish me! Support me!
And what's that?
All right. Will you please sit down now?  Symington says.
Just a little joke, Miss Farmer.
Doctor, I hate to break this to you, but my mother is a little batty.
You what?
I'm sure you'll see it my way in the end.
Yeah?
Yes.
People can be kinder than you think.
Come warm yourself if you like.
Then why am I here? What did you want with me?
In which part of me did this knowledge reside? In these hands? In this mind? In this heart?  And reading and speaking. Not things learned... so much as things remembered.
Friend?
Soon?
Yes. I want this over and done with.
She's beautiful.
Scandalous! What would your dear mother say?
Something's wrong. I know it.  I've heard rumors of cholera spreading south from Hamburg.
Elizabeth. If it's true, travel into Germany would be banned. You'd never get near Ingolstadt.  Besides, they're only rumors.
Don't listen, Willie. Progress is a feast to be consumed. Women would have you believe you must walk before you can run. Or run before you can waltz!
I'll have to do better than that.
I've loved you all my life
This feels... incestuous.
Only you.
You make me weak.
I give you my soul...
Do you know this man? Is there something between you?
So do I.
We need each other now, I need your comfort and strength, not separation and solitude.
I remember the first time I ever saw you. Crossing the floor of the grand ballroom with my parents at your side. So beautiful even then.
Victor!
He died. Raving about phantoms. He was mad, poor devil.  Gather a detail. Have the body removed from my cabin.
I'm convinced. Not by treating symptoms, but by diving nature's most jealously-guarded secrets.
He was a frightened soul who acted out of fear and ignorance.
Keep your voice down. You don't know what you're saying.
Why Waldman? He of all people should have cheated death!
All the more reason for us to continue his work with the poor!
We all know how hard you took Waldman's death. Even Krempe is sympathetic. But it is time to move on. It is time to concern yourself with life.
Listen to what I'm saying. The militia's arriving to quarantine the city. Most of us are getting out while we still can.
Thank God your fever broke.  Slowly, now. Just a sip.  I've been worried we might lose you. It's been touch-and-go for a week.
No. They don't.
Murder Willie? In my heart, he was our child. Victor's and mine. Such a thing could never have entered my mind.
Or Albertus Magnus. Cornelius Agrippa...
It's utterly fantastic! This is the sort of thing I'm talking about! We should be learning this!
But the possibilities. Combining ancient knowledge with new? Something like this could change our fundamental views!
There's a startling question, coming from you.  I'm captain of this ship. We sailed from Archangel a month ago, seeking a passage to the North Pole.
Give them a little while longer. It's still early, anyway.
Cabin B is ready.
You want to leave?
Next Friday.
I didn't know I was asleep... What time is it?
It sounded like Brenda.
Jack?
You said we were special.
I wouldn't know.
No wonder they lost America. How could you sneak around in the bushes wearing that? What's to eat?
It's gonna be a long summer.
Wind's up. It's shifted a good hundred and eighty degrees.
He keeps on acting like such an asshole!
This is no dream. Want to escape for a while?
Cowboy.
You okay?
I have six new counsellor up there. They're all babes in the woods in every sense of the word.
That's thirty percent.
Have you ever been there before?
I'm sorry to hear that. What were they, psychos?
Oh, Seth, how can I ever make it up to you?
Why do you want to stop?
What's your name?
Jacob.
Where are the keys to the motor home?
Come again?
Sorry, I need everybody.
Is this real?
Why'd ya quit?
I swear to God I won't try to escape and I'll do my best to get you into Mexico.
I don't have the slightest idea.
Then?
He backed down.
What are you going to do?
Not enough to be a pastor. Look, I know this is hard on you kids. After Jenny's death, this is probably the last thing you need. But I can't do it any longer. My congregation needs spiritual leadership. Well, they can't get that from me anymore. My faith is gone. To answer your question, yes, I do believe in Jesus. But do I love them? No. After Jenny died, I just thought, what's the point?
What?
What?
How about you, cutie pie? Ready for round two?
Daddy's dead.
Not many.
Should I use the last bullets on us?
See ya.
-- you got your sink --
Haven't felt it a bit. Been inside with the air conditioner blastin' all day long.
I never said help us!
You can't come in here.
Gotcha!
What am I supposed to do, Seth? He recognized us.
Do they have cable?
Do they have a waterbed?
All I'm saying --
Where's the woman?
I just want to go on record as saying this is a bad idea.
As long as you don't act like a fuckin' nut, we'll be just fine.
What dya mean, don't worry about it. Of course I'm gonna worry about it, I can't fuckin' see.
I'm lookin' scared?
My shit is together.
Thank you, ensign.
Or rank.  But can you do me a favor and pull a transfer order?
Awright.  How's our girl doin', anyway?
I'm fine, sir.
Barber was my next stop, sir. Would've had it regulation sooner, only --
No, sir.
Across the board, sir.
Entering my scan now...
What, we're gonna pry 'em out with paddles?
White House boys want a private meeting.
I know that, sir.  Ma'am.  It's just that... Beggin' your pardon, Senator, but... do you understand that this involves combat training?
Can't complain, ma'am.
Wickwire was there to help.  To be my eyes on the inside, to make sure you were getting a fair shot.  At least that was the intent.
The reality is this:  We send far too many men off to war.  I don't need to compound the problem with women.  Can you honestly tell me you wanted that life?  Squat-pissing in some third-world jungle with --
I can make this wall without --
O'Neil?
Miller.  Thought the guy was made of depleted uranium.  Really didn't expect to lose him.
Boat Five -- Wickwire, Cozad, Vinyl, Intagliata, Ayers, and Wise. Lieutenant Wickwire is your senior officer.  Follow his orders to your death.
I'll try anyway, sir.
The Navy Cross...
Thank you, sir.  We hear back from the Pentagon?
By the way, I'll need that option paper by 11-hundred today so I can review it with Admiral Hanover.  And do we have any of that breakfast tea around here?
Well, you're doin' shit-hot at Intel.
This has nothing to do with you.
You know, I had an apartment about this size once.
Nah, they were dead-ass asleep.  But on every guard's chest,they left one Marlboro cigarette.  Just a little calling card to say they'd been there -- and could come back any time they wanted.
First big night of liberty and no date?  You're pathetic, Wickwire.
Maybe I'll just head over to McP's with the others, have a drink or four.  Don't wanna come, do you?
Maybe half.  Not even.
Are you hungry?  What's your favorite food?  We'll try to get it for you.
Would you have shot if it was a man?
That's what your crew said.  Are they lying?  Or are you?
Aw, lookit this, lookit this -- she's bringin' Tampax in here. C'mon, you got nothin' but rooms over there.
You mind?  I'm trying to eat here.
This ain't about some little soldier girl sloggin' her way through commando school.  The implications go way beyond.
I take it this file is still open.
That why you dumped him?
Great stuff, Animal. Weren't you scared?
Audrey, did you take the tape out of the camera?
So, you still picking apart cockroaches?
No, I'm into earthworms now. You wouldn't be interested. They're real "boring" creatures. Very reliable, dependable, no surprises...
I got pretty close.
Well, obviously these tests weren't designed for this but fundamentally they're looking for the same hormonal patterns that would indicate pregnancy.
Who is he?
What the hell are you doing?
He said he'd consider it. It's between you and Rodriguez.
And you're beautiful...
I want that story, Audrey. Remember you work for me.
No. Perhaps I work too much.
Merde!
Well your people are getting in the way of my job.
The radiation is not an anomaly, it's the clue. This creature is far too unique on every level to be some lost dinosaur.
You see, all we need to do is get a better shot at it with weapons that don't rely on heat seeking...
We have learned that your American friends have decided not to look for the creature's nest.
So why all the secrecy? Why aren't you guys working with the US military?
Don't do that. I'm not kidding.
Is that the bathroom?
Dr. Lazarus, here is your surface mapper.  I have programed it to the coordinates of a Beryllium Sphere of sufficient density.
Come on, old friend...
You WILL go out there.
Nothing.
Yes. Good was done this .....
Settle down, Alex...
Could you possibly try  not to hit  every  single  one!
You know, with the makeup and everything1 I actually thought he was smart for a second.
May I get the check?
You've got the utility systems walkthrough, right?
It's okay. Listen-
I knew it!... I KNEW it!...
Okay, we got it.
Commander, do you have a camera?  I'd die to see this in person... All they showed on T,V was a machine here, and a wall here... I don't know why they didn't show the whole thing.
We'd never have the budget for this.
The Beryllium Sphere has fractured under stress.
That possibly... The valence bonds have shifted bi-laterally?
Hey Commander. Listen, we found some Beryllium on a nearby planet. We might be able to get there if we re-configure the solar matrix in parallel for endothermic propulsion. What do you think?
The digital conveyer?  You mean I'm going to get diced into cubes and sorted up there in a thousand pieces?
You Okay, Alex?
Hi everybody.
Not a clue. You?
On the show I talk to the computer and repeat what it says. So that's what they built.
There's no hatch.  There's no hatch!
Gwen...
Because it was on the show!
Home.
NO, Thank God he has not.
A thousand apologies. We have failed you.
Well... Sort of...
But there it is!...
You said we do appearances together, or not at all.'
Oh, right, sorry.
NO NO NO.
Let's do it, Tommy.
enerao, I've host them. The maanetlsm o: the field Is disrupting our onstru- ~ait. There they are
Because they're coming right at us.
I capture Quebec leading an Army by river fordings through Maine... If we don't do it, the British will come down Champlain, take back Ticonderoga and attack us in the spring.
Well, you fought with them against the French and Iroquois, how good were they then?
Why in hell would John do that? Why in hell would any of them do that?  After all you've done, it's unbelievable!
What do you think, George, shall I resign?  It's what they want.
The army needs you.
Then, I need you.  We all do. Without your victory the men would have no hope at all.
That can't be.
Colonel, sir, Mrs. Washington inquires if you are going to join her for dinner?
Yes, General.  But if you have to shoot somebody, you can't.
Me?  You apologizing to me?
Because they have hardly any uniforms, they designate officers with colored ribbons.  My lord.
What the goddamned hell do you think you are doing!?
That's Greene.  He's supporting our reconsolidation.
I was a clerk's apprentice on Saint Croix.  But, then I went to King's College.
Are you going to keep him, sir?
Yessir.
He warned you some day you might have to act for the good of the people -- even if it was against Congress.  George, the time has come for you to declare yourself king of America.  Listen to me, the whole army would rise up as one and place you on a throne!  George, you must declare yourself with us or against us.
George, you're the only man the people trust... trust with power. They know you won't betray them.
George, I'm sorry.  We all know the army will acquit Arnold...
Of course the army will acquit him, that's not the point... Arnold is a man and will understand.  What I need to understand is, John, Sam... what is happening here?  Who are those people in there?  The fat ones in silk?
Washington is perfect.  He's a Southerner, he's a war hero and he's rich!
I tell you every damned place I go the man is adored!  "General Washington!  Champion of Trenton! Savior of the Republic!"  And you should hear the way people are deprecating Congress!
Did God ever make such a pitiful army?
The British army, sir!
Unofficially, General Greene.
If we have any hope for a compromise or truce with England now, we have to hold on here:  our men must believe they can win -- the British must believe that somehow, in some mad, impossible way we might actually be able to hurt them.
Joseph, the British spent thousands of pounds and precious months putting together a fleet that Arnold stopped by sacrificing a heap of old barges.  In my opinion he saved my army.
But the Hessians are there!  No one can beat them!  That's why Cornwallis stationed them there! They have the post of honor!  They are invincible!
George, I'm afraid if you go through with this madness I must tender my resignation as your aide. I see where we're headed, you're putting your trust in the likes of Hamilton and Arnold...
Well, I shall deny him to you!  He is evil on earth!
Sir, please accept my commission from Congress... and...  You must see this portrait of my beautiful wife, Adrienne, we had the most perfect little baby girl just before I left.  Her name is Henriette...
I... they look both the same.
I only meant...
My God!  Who ordered this retreat?!
But to go to war over trade, over money?  Surely there's still time for a compromise.
Well, a very real expectation is the British will hang you!  They'll burn Mount Vernon and they'll hang you!  Our marriage is a business just as surely as...
I think I heard that.
Martha!  For God's sake!
We can't take them.  Are you all right?
At one time I could have chosen not to be.
They're for my bodyguard.  I have an absolute conviction that Arnold is planning to have me assassinated!  It will be harder if I am surrounded by a body of men who look like me, don't you think?
George, you know I only love you, but...
But not more than your comfort.
So, you are William's wild young neighbor?  Or should I say, 'brother'; William claims you as a member of his family.  I have heard so many unflattering tales about you, and I understand, that except for you, this 'family' is quite cultivated.
Africa, of course.
Slavers capture them and bring them here.
Or, 'civilized'.
Do you?  When I saw those men yesterday in the field... and the women and children in those hovels? I'm not so sure if America is as far from England as I'd hoped.
Let's get you darker!
Just because they are born?
What is this?
So where's the money?
No. What's this?
Trade for what?
And that's for the airport.
Catlett says if you don't open the locker the deal's off.
Look, there's no fuckin' way I'm gonna give you the key, outside of you point a gun at my head. Then we might have something to talk about. Now step away from the car.
He's my sister's kid. No papa. Not too bright. Personally, I think he's a retard. I only gave him the job as a favor for my sister, you understand?
I gave him a key to a locker that had the money in it.
Where's your partner, the jumpy one? Why isn't he here?
You know, you speak very good English, Mr. Escobar.
I missed that one. Or, hey, you know who else? Morgan Freeman. You know Morgan?
It was Rio Bravo. Robert Mitchum was the drunk in El Dorado, Dean Martin in Rio Bravo, practically the same part. John Wayne, he also did the same thing in both. He played John Wayne.
Yeah, I hear you bagged Martin Weir for Mr. Lovejoy.
Last night. When he called me over to your office to talk about it.
I don't know.
You get to town, you go straight to the bank, raid the limo account.
Depends. Who's this?
What three hundred grand?
Hello? You there?
I work for Harry Zimm, alright?
Who?
Why would I do that?
I checked the bag at the airport, when I came.
The man you're steppin' on belongs to me and my partner.
You have a card in here?
I'm looking at you.
You know Dick Allen, Mesa's Casino?
I know what a marker is.
You gonna get rough now, threaten me? I make good by tomorrow or get my legs broken?
Part of it, yeah.
You mean, Leo?
I'm not the guy, Harry.
I'm out here looking for Leo. I just looked you up as a favor to your dear friend, Dick Allen.
What's it called?
One of his best parts.
Harry, I probably know 'em better than you do.
Lovejoy sits behind the wheel, watching the bar across the street, getting his video camera ready for action...  What's he doing? Following a guy?
Is he giving you a check or cash?
Which also means when I speak, I'm speakin' for Jimmy. So e.g. as of now, you start affording me the proper respect.
Bullshit. E.g. is short for 'ergo'.
You know, Marty, you were good in The Cyclone.
So you want to know.
No, I want you to look at me the way I'm looking at you. Put it in your eyes, 'You're mine, asshole,' without saying it.
How'd you know I was here?
But a week. That's a hundred and fifty percent a year.
Man, can you scream.
I don't like the title. Or the main guy's name.
And you think the movie business is any different?
This thing's actually accurate. I bought it for ten bucks from a kid in a lawn chair on Sunset...
Yeah?
I mean I could see myself in movies Robert De Niro had been in. Or I could maybe do an Al Pacino movie, play a hard-on. But I couldn't see myself in ones, like say the one where the three guys get stuck with a baby. They don't know how to take care of it and you see these big grown-up assholes acting cute -
I don't know.
You okay?
They're closing the Granview. You know, theater down on Biscayne?
That's what the guy said.
Hey, Chili.  Get your coat, but don't piss the guy off, okay? It could get complicated and we'd have to call Momo to straighten it out. Then Momo gets pissed for wasting his time and we don't need that.
Whatta you doing out there?
I'm going into the movie business.
I don't think the producer has to do much, outside of maybe knowing a writer.
Pick 'n' Save.
Yeah, me too. He was a helluva good writer. And I would know. I discovered him. Made him what he was.
What's wrong?
Harry, what're you still doing with those guys?
I'm sitting here, I'm looking at you and I'm having these flashes. You know, flashbacks, of memories.  Of us.
What is the vessel name, registry, and present position? Over.
Roger, Arctic Warrior. I say again, our records indicate the passenger vessel Chimera was lost at sea. Over.
Arctic Warrior, Arctic Warrior, Arctic Warrior. This is United States Coastguard Station North Island. Your radio check is affirmative. Over.
Hear that, Dodge? Epps don't think it's a problem.
Fucker!
Take it easy, Dodge. It's only a piece of metal.
What is your first name?
Maureen.
What the hell would a freighter be doing up here? It's way out of the lanes. There's not a port for 800 miles.
The number one turbine's pretty well trashed. Number two runs, but it's way underpowered.
Metal's crystallized. Gotta replace the whole deal.
A salvage claim to a vessel's cargo's as valid as a claim to the vessel itself. It's ours.
If he's reasonable, maybe we can make some kind of deal. If not. We'll have to re-consider our options.
That'd be my guess.
What is it?
How do you mean?
The radio!
Take it easy, willya? What about the radio?!
Don't fall asleep.
Morning everybody.
Showed him a hell of a lot more than that.
Lights?
Go on.
What'd you find up there?
Ever heard of the Mary Celeste?
Nope.
Nobody knows. There've been a lot of theories, of course. But we'll never really know for sure.
Why not call for help?
Just before I heard him yell there was somebody on the radio.
What?
Collision? With what?
It's a good bet they'll be asking a lot of questions when they get here too.
Murphy to Epps.
Epps? You there?
Could be a stroke. Who knows?  The general log said the crew were fighting among themselves. "Like wild dogs."
Hard to say which is worse, staying here or taking our chances in open water.
I didn't want it to turn out this way.
I think I see it pretty well.
I think maybe you been on this boat a little too long, with all that supernatural mumbo jumbo. There's nothing supernatural about greed. And that's what it comes down to, pure and simple.
I don't give a damn about the gold.
Let the buyer beware.
How's that?
Some classy tub in it's day, huh?
You're up late.
If they thought it was lost at sea, they probably just wrote it off.
Pretty low all around.
You don't remember?
We're still drifting.
He took the shotgun and a light.
So whoever did this now has our shotgun.
What about the gold?
Better late than never.
You got a leak in the number nine compartment.
Guess.
YES.
It's nothing -- it's just some hormonal thing... don't worry about it...
What?
Uh, no. I missed that one. But what do I know? I like Laurel and Hardy movies.
Hey... so, what brings you down here?
Did you actually do this painting?
What do you mean?
Well hello there, young employee of the Sidewinder.
What can you tell me, young man, about the various flavors of "frozen yogurt"?
So, where's "Weird Al"?
Yeah, right.
No.
Are you the one who left that note?
Why?
Why?
God, it's so weird that we're finally out of high school... We've been waiting for this our whole life! Now we can get our own apartment and do anything we want.  It's such a weird feeling.
Hey, look, the satanists are leaving!
What do you do if you're a satanist, anyway?
Or maybe not.
You can have that one.
I remember when I first started reading these I thought DWF stood for "dwarf!"
What does it stand for?
It's obviously him!
He doesn't even look that bummed out, really.
Gross!
I think it's cute - look at his little weasel teeth.
He should totally just kill himself... Hey, here's one  ...Oh wait...  you have to share it with a non smoking feminist and her two cats...
Not really...
That's who people want to rent to. It's a known fact that it's way easier to get a job and everything if you're rich... All we have to do is buy a few semi-expensive outfits and act like it's no big deal... it'll be fun.
Yeah, he's beyond human stuff like that.
How about this one?
I'll be right back, I'm gonna go get a beer.
Anthony's II!
That guy is totally amazing.
I wonder if I hang around with you because you're like my surrogate mother figure or something. Like I have this subconscious biological need to be nagged and bitched at constantly.
Or maybe... did you ever think that deep down we really might be lesbos? Maybe that's why we spend so much time together.
That's not true, I just hate all these obnoxious, extroverted, pseudo- bohemian losers!  Sometimes I think I act so weird because I'm crazy from sexual frustration.
Wasn't it like eighth grade?
Seventh... you wanted to move out right then!
Don't worry.
I can't, it's Seymour's birthday...  Shit! What time is it?  I have to go to the store! I was going to make him a cake...
Go ahead...
I can't afford stuff like this right now.
Do you still want to do something tonight?
What happened to Seymour?
It's a totally normal, average neighborhood!
What? When did you see Josh?!
He came into work.
Oh yeah, I can tell you really love it!
Hello?
Please let me come with you. Please please please...
Really? Both of you?... Why not?
What are you going to be when you grow up, Todd?
Well I'm going to major in Business Administration and, I think, minor in Communications.
It's really quite something to see you all grown up like this, Enid.  I'd love to hear about what you're doing. I can't help but feel that I had some small part in how you turned out...  What are you studying? You were always such a smart little girl.
I want to know what you think you're doing, staying out all night and worrying your father to death!
Perhaps the "Jam-in-ator" appeals to you.  Absolutely no practice necessary.  You shread like a giant. Just press a button.
Who does?
I know it's over, asshole, I --
Hi... what's your name?
Tsk! You Jews are so clever with money...
Hey, where are you going?
Five hundred.
A dollar seventy-five.
Oops! I dropped it!
I... I didn't think you would have any interest in this get together... I mean if you had told me you were coming I would have warned you -- it's not like a real party or anything.
Yeah, well...
Okay, what about this one? Are you into girls with big tits?
C'mon Seymour, I'm trying to collect data here! Don't you want me to find you your perfect dream girl?
So is that your boyfriend?
Yes, that would certainly do...
But it's not totally hopeless for you... I've had it. I don't even have the energy to try anymore.  You should make sure you do the exact opposite of everything I do so you don't end up like me...
For nineteen years...
What are you, a fry cook or something?
Are you okay?
Why?
Wow!  What was that all about?
Uh yeah. A long time ago... she called before once... it's just somebody trying to humiliate me.
Actually, it's kind of still happening... she's over here right now... I think everything's going pretty well...
Really?
So, what kind of stuff do you guys do together? Is she into old records and stuff?
I dunno... okay, I guess...  I fucked that guy Josh finally...
And you like them?
No, no... not exactly... she just doesn't understand how I would know somebody like you...
In what way do you mean?
What's up?
I mean... of course I... why wouldn't I want to go out with you?
So what's the story with the two cheerleaders over here?
Seymour? You gotta be kidding me!
Well, here's where the fun never stops!
So Josh, if this guy freaks out, will you protect us?
Talk to us about it...
Why? What did she tell you?
What do you mean?
Didn't she ever tell you about that? God, she really is pathological...
Yes?
Oh, you're a doctor now, too?
My wife is the game player in the family, sir.
-build the bridge over the Tsavo river. And be finished in four months time. Can you do that?
Lovely sound- they seem happy.
Don't they, though?
It hasn't been that simple so far.
-well, it's just...  ...other men don't abandon their wives at such a time-
All right- you'll spend your nights inside.  You'll have plenty of ammunition. You're totally protected, you have really nothing to fear.
-well, of course he kept moving- but he couldn't have been more than ten feet away from the three of you- surely you must have wounded the thing-
Excellent. Could I see the bridge site? 
I don't suppose I could watch.
John? I know this isn't the time to ask, but-
What a good week.
Nonsense- Samuel would have done something. 
Have you got it?
...misfire... it jammed...
Has it ever done that before?
Have you ever failed?
Where could it have gone? How could it get across the water?  They're only lions, yes?
Understood- you realize now you could never have done it without me.
Why do the workers look unhappy?
It's all wonderfully under control, Samuel- you've done a splendid job.
Did it look like this in your mind?
You've known him long?
Some mysteries should not have solutions.
Every day I ask you, and every day you've got something else to do.  Do I have bad breath or something?
Do you need anything?  You want me to come in?
I know.  Marry me, Dana, and together we will raise Vigo as our son.  There are many perks that come with being the mother of a living god.  I'm sure he will supply for us a magnificent apartment.  And perhaps a car and free parking.
What are you working on, Egon?
Does he ever mention me?
You're also a human being, Frank.
I'm sure you didn't come here just to talk about art.
I don't know what to do anymore.
Thank you.  Poor baby.  I think I should put him down now.
It's Janine Melnitz, from my staff.  She's one of my most valuable employees.
Does she know anything about babies?
Janine Melnitz, are you kidding?  Do I have a vase?  I brought some of your clothes.  Wear something intriguing.  I brought along some interesting possibilities.
I put them in your hamper.  I thought they were dirty.
Oh, Peter, I didn't dump you.  I just had to protect myself.  You really weren't very good for me, you know.
I think we hit the honeypot, boys.  There's something brewing under the street.
According to my sources, the world will end on February 14, in the year 2016.
Can I help you?
Oh migod!  I'm sorry.  I didn't mean to do that.  It was an accident.
What are you doing up here?
Have you made any plans yet?  You know tomorrow is New Year's Eve.
Janine, do you feel like maybe getting something to eat on the way home?
It's really not a bad place.  It just needs a woman's touch.
Pleasure to meet you.  I've seen you on television.
Your honor, may I approach the bench?
I can't do it, Louis.  It isn't ethical.  I could lose my license.
You were the one who got me in.
I fixed you up with Diane Troxler and she put out, didn't she?
It's working.  The positive GeV's are climbing.
You might want to check those Duke University mean averaging studies on controlled psychokinesis.
The New York Pneumatic Railway.  It was an experimental subway system.  Fan-forced air-trains, built around 1870.
I'm Egon --
If you two are looking for a fight, you got one.  Who wants it first?  Come on, Ray.  Try me, sucker.
Something that appeals to the best in each and every one of us --
Geez, I forgot how heavy these things are.
Like a goat on garbage.
I think she looks pretty good here, don't you?
Are you telling me how to drive?
Kind of makes you wonder, doesn't it?
To the bathroom, where do you think?
Oh, Dana, it's you.
Well, actually Louis I have a friend coming by.
There's nothing there now and I don't get any significant readings.
This is terrible.  Either there's a monster in my kitchen or I'm completely crazy.
That's it.  Get out.
Then leave.
I'll cancel the reservation,  I found the name "Zuul" in ...  The Roylance Guide to Secret Societies and Sects.  I don't suppose you've  read it.
You must have gotten the last copy.
I trust you're moving us to a better space somewhere on campus.
He's a big one.  You don't want to mess with that particular breed.
I don't care.  I see us as tiny parts of a vast organism, like two bacteria living on a rotting speck of dust floating in an infinite void.
I don't believe in luck.
Keep it anyway.  I have another one at home.
Janine, I'm sure a woman with your qualifications would have no trouble finding a top flight job in the housekeeping or food service industry.
Did you ever report it to anyone?
Great!  How's it going?
I see.  And now you catch ghosts?
You turned off the power!  Look, there was another man here ... You have to find him and bring him back.  A short determined-looking guy with the eyes of a happy zombie.
They're not guns.  They're particle throwers.
What have you got, Egon?
Oh, this is big, Peter.  This is very big. There's definitely something here.
Spengler, are you serious about actually catching a ghost?
I just realized something.  We've never had a completely successful test with any of the equipment.
Anything!  Just make contact.
You're always so worried about your reputation.  We don't need the University. Einstein did his best stuff while he was working as a patent clerk.'They can't stop progress.
You'll never regret this, Ray.
How was your date?
No sense worrying about it now.
So far all we got is a shit smell on the twelfth floor and we almost fried a Puerto Rican bellboy.
As a duly-constituted representative of the City of New York, and on behalf of the County and State of New York, the United States of America, the Planet Earth and all its inhabitants, I hereby order you to cease and desist any and all supernatural activity and return at once to your place of origin or next parallel dimension.
Every ancient religion had its own myth about the end of the world.
If I may be so bold...
What is that... wailing?
Tell Lykas to send a retiarius and a Samnite to help Tiger.
I want that bastard dead!
Gladly Caesar.
But they're not destroyed, not yet.
You and my father have become very close.  Perhaps one day I may say the same for us.
Ignore that?!  The sooner we leave this disgusting place the better.
Underdog!  How can he be an underdog -- he wins all the time!  I'm the emperor why can't I kill him?  He could be poisoned, or somehow killed to look like an accident.
A republican is a man who strives to create equality among all classes.  At the core he's a man who believes in doing what's right.
I need to give you my word when yours is worth nothing?
Commodus is just a young man, he'll learn what you had to learn.
So I understand.
Don't stop to visit -- take the children straight home and I'll follow as soon as I can.
Why don't we try to keep politics out of the conversation.
Then give the empire back to the people... the children who will grow up to become senators...
What are you fighting for in here? The good of Rome?  I can end this madness now!  Take the job for the sake of the Gods, live!
I never knew a more idealistic man than you.
When you get to Ostia, use this -- bribe passage to Africa or Spain. Save my family.  You should be able to find a merchant ship that will take you to Egypt then to Numidia.
I refuse to be your slave.  I refuse --
What would the poster say: "Narcissus would kill for a taste of Golden Pompeii Olive Oil?"
It will be good luck for you to wear that helmet... It belonged to Cimon of Smyrna... he was crushed by an elephant.
No more bad luck now!  The people are anticipating you!  I have posters up over half the city advertising you as the great warrior -- the true Roman!  The man who fought side by side with the wolf of Rome!
The point is you get to fight the easy country circuit, the small arenas, relax, live the good life!
I can really rape them on this!  Can I at least tell them you'll think about it?
Before they leave, get gold.
Right, right, what am I thinking of?
Listen -- could you stop crying, please?
No -- I was just thinking -- look -- it's still early -- we could do something -- go somewhere else.
Yes.
What is it?
No.
Benjamin -- I would like to know what you're doing here.
Here? In Berkeley?
Yes.
I want to ask you a question.
No. I want to know why you're here in Berkeley?
Is it because I'm here?
Well, I want you to leave.
Elaine -- I love you.
But you might.
We could go down and get our blood tests tomorrow.
Well -- I have to see Carl first.
Carl Smith. He's a medical student. We've known him for years.
Well, what did he say? I'm curious.
Thank you.
Exactly how do you mean?
Mr. McCleery -- do you have some change? I need to use the phone?
Could I make one phone call first?
Uh -- The Taft Hotel.
Oh -- yes. The Singleman party.
Sir?
I mean I'd -- I'd rather not go to the trouble of bringing it all in. I just have a toothbrush. I can get it myself. If that's all right.
How are you, Benjamin?
Is it a girl?
Benjamin, I want to ask you something.
Thank you.
Yes.
Mrs. Robinson, you didn't -- I mean you didn't expect --
Why no. I hadn't thought of it. I feel rather flattered that you --
We'll forget it right now. Finish your drink.
We had it done last Christmas. Would you like to see it?
Yes?
What?
Is that what you're trying to tell me?
Let me out!
Well -- I don't know.
I got a single room.
Yes?
The number.
Yes?
This is all terribly wrong.
Wait a minute.
If you want.
Well I just don't think we have much to say to each other.
Are you tired of it?
Oh my God.
Leave it on! Now we are going to do this thing. We are going to have a conversation. Think of another topic.
How about art.
I got up. I ate breakfast and went shopping. During the afternoon I read a novel.
What do you say to him?
What?
Thank you.
We don't.
No.
What?
All right. Now let's get to bed.
Not particularly.
I'm curious.
I wish you'd tell me.
Good.
We're not dropping it. Now that's the reason, isn't it? I'm a dirty degenerate, aren't I? I'm not fit to --
You're not.
Don't you expect me to be a little hurt?
Mrs. Robinson, you stand there and tell me I'm not good enough for your daughter.
But it's not.
But if it's sickening for you --
Promise me, Benjamin.
Mrs. Robinson --
Ahh. I don't think you'll have time for that drink after all.
I'll find her.
No -- actually I'm not --
Oh, no.
Then what do you do? Do you meet someone?
What about it?
You got me.
She's upstairs. She wanted me to wait down here till you got home.
Standing guard over the old castle, are you?
Here. It looks like you need a refill.
Twenty. I'll be twenty-one next week.
That's a hell of a good age to be.
Thank you.
I wish I was that age again. Because, Ben --
Sir?
I've watched you grow up, Ben.
Oh say -- Elaine gets down from Berkeley on Saturday.
Ben -- I want you to give her a call.
Ben, I think we're two civilized human beings. Do you think it's necessary to threaten each other?
Don't shout at me, Ben.
Yes.
And what are you going to do?
The pearls are in her room.
I could take care of her.
You can't.
How?
Have you seen it?
That.
You?
Oh -- work!!
Lord no -- charming -- but why one meal a day?
Free --
Where downstairs?
You're not a bit like you were yesterday.
Going?
Nothing -- only to be here.
Poor little Grusinskaya! Does it do you good to cry? Are you afraid? Shall I go?
I was so alone -- always alone -- and suddenly you were there and said that.  No. I am not afraid. It is strange.
I'd like to smoke a cigarette.
No irony. You're so appealing -- so soft -- so tired. I feel like taking you in my arms and not letting anything more happen to you -- ever.
You mustn't talk Russian to me.
Strange man...
Grusinskaya... Oh -- oh if you knew how I slaved and slaved for Grusinskaya -- for the success of Grusinskaya -- for the triumph of Grusinskaya... and what is she now? Just someone who has found that on the day success ceases life ceases -- Are you listening to me -- Do you understand? -- I want you to understand.
I think you must go now -- the key is on the floor.
Why do you smile?
No.
The veronal -- you. I'm going to stay here with you.
I am Felix Benvenuto von Gaigern. My mother called me Flix.
Yesterday I was a thief -- but now, --
I wanted money desperately -- Can you understand? -- That's why I wanted the pearls. I was threatened -- I was desperately in need of a certain big sum of money. I've been following you -- I've admired you. But I have forced myself not to think about you -- Last night, at last, I managed to came into your room and -- and now.
Why later?
Thank you, sir.
Not at all, sir. 
Oh -- here you are, Baron. A drink -- A Louisiana flip?
Gambling! I'd like that. I have over six thousand eight hundred marks with me.
We could come to my room.
Is that too much, Baron?
Grusinskaya -- well, to tell the truth, Baron -- tonight we are a little bit nervous. Were you at the theatre last night?
Yes -- He always seems to be waiting for something -- and nothing ever comes.
So that's how we stand, Baron.
No, Doctor.
Any letters?
I know -- I know -- when a man's collar is an inch too big for him -- I know he is ill.
Oh, thank you, Miss Flaemm. Oh, please, Miss Flaemm -- Permit me, Miss Flaemm, won't you have something sweet -- a Louisiana flip.  A Louisiana flip.
Please -- please!
Oh -- I was thinking -- Poor Baron -- Lying there, his eyes so open.
I didn't like Preysing right off.
You don't understand that do you?
What...! --
You...
Should throw a great weight into the balance...
My daughters -- yes, my daughters. 
Definitely off.
Come and dance with me, Mr. Kringelein.
I must speak to you, Miss Flaemm -- business.
No -- now.
I must go to England -- at once.
You see, I'd like to take a secretary with me for my correspondence and -- humm -- humm -- for company on the trip -- I'm nervous -- I need somebody -- I don't know if you quite understand me. You said you have travelled with gentlemen -- and I mean --
Wait -- I must figure it up.  First, I'll need -- clothes -- shoes -- it's cold in England in March, I'll need a suit... You'd want me to look nice?
You are late. I've been waiting for you -- waiting.
We are here to discuss our merger. Naturally I can make no statement at this time. We must begin at the beginning.
I'm laying before you the last general statement of our concern. Active capital, plant and machinery, raw material and finished product -- for instance -- mop rags --
No water -- What a place!
Here's my signature -- here Preysing, sign here.
But, Madam. cannot do that.
I've done my hair differently -- do you like that?
When a lady falls in love she does her hair differently.
I'm cancelling the engagement.
Hurry, Suzette.
Come along, oh, Madam, come along. The train will be going.
It is not stage fright -- it's something more --
Again?
Yes, the police must be called.
Oh, no -- no -- not the Baron.
Her room -- oh -- I see, Mr. Preysing -- I understand, Mr. General Director Preysing.
Yes, I know them --
The scandal -- we are men -- you -- you could take that affair of the young lady upon yourself -- take her and hold your tongue. Then you can travel -- I'll give you anything -- anything -- she was with you.
Ach! Here you are, Doctor Zinnowitz.
Waiting -- I'm waiting for news from Manchester.
What's the matter with you?
She had an engagement in the Yellow Room at five o'clock -- she was in a hurry.
One question. Do you want to stick to that story, or do you want to keep your teeth?
Oh, thanks, Bobo.
That's right. Take a little, leave a little.
Or else he's working an angle. If he doesn't steal a little, he's steeling big.
Good evening. I'd like a single for tonight.
One of those computer geniuses, isn't it?
We have to be ready. We have to have the money, and we have to know what the information means, and we have to move immediately.
What? He's going to be all right!
Well, make it stop!
His blood pressure is under a hundred. I don't think he'll live to get to the hospital.
Mrs. Langtry, I'm sorry.
You are a valued customer, as you know.
This is some of the finest filigreed platinum I've ever seen. But the stones, no. They're not diamonds, Mrs. Langtry.
It was a gift. It isn't worth anything at all?
You're right. I apologize. But I still want to talk to you.
I can't take that job! I mean, I mean, I can't take it right away. I'm still recuperating, I just dropped in to say hello, see everybody --
I take care of the being-fair-to-me department. Things've gone to hell this long, they can go a little longer.
Don't mention it.
Why?
Going somewhere?
No.
I wouldn't go in on a deal with her. She blamed you for it.
It is, isn't it? And maybe it's a break for me after all. I've been wanting out of the racket for years, and now I'm out. I can make a clean start, and --
I'm sorry. I hated to take your money, but --
Roy... What if I told you I wasn't really your mother? That we weren't related?
Is there nothing I can do, Roy, nothing at --
I'll have it tonight. Nine o'clock? Ten?
Where's the five?
You were bleeding inside, honey. Remember that bruise you had?
Get well soon.
Every day in every way.
No.
I watched you. Working the tap on those soldier boys.
I'm a salesman.
I was teamed ten years with the best in the business. Cole Langley.
And when he got serious?
No no! He never calls the cops, not after we give him the blow-off.
He retired.
Join up with you! I watched you, Roy, I've been watching you, wondering if I should talk about this at all, or maybe just... 
You were gone for a while.
I called a fellow I know in Tulsa, the one who plays my chauffeur. There's a sucker there he says is made for us. And a boroker that just shut down, we can use their office, not change a thing! Now, I can scrape up ten grand without much trouble. That leaves fifteen or twenty for your end. We could start this weekend, get the sucker into position --
What?
The last I looked, we were just talking things over.
No! Because I --
Bullshit!
Someone who knows her well could still identify her, that's not the problem. It's just there's, uh, it's likely to be a shock.
Well, thank you. And thank them.
Carter.
I can be real stiff.
Oh.  Sorry.  I'm on my way to the ring and --
Jimmy, what are you doing?
No.  Wait for the police.
Nothing's missing?
Nothing's changed since yesterday, or last week, or last month... the answer's still "no."
Where are you going?
John, you can't help her now.
What?  Where is she?
Well, I'm not going until I talk to you.
Aren't they doing a terrific job this year?
This kid just wants his freedom.
A box of fortune cookies... I'm running out of advice.
You just dropped a shitload on him... give him some time to digest it.
What's this?
Shit, Linda!
Wasn't scaring the hell out of me once today enough?!
Let the party begin.
Hold on, hot lips.  We got work to do.
Aren't you gonna answer that?
Mom, I want to go to the fair ...
Mommy, I'm scared.
What is it this time?
Who are you?
Runes were a kind of early alphabet that originated in Northern Europe thousands of years ago.  They were symbols -- carved out of stone or pieces of wood.  Of all the runes, Thorn had the most negative influence. Cults used them in blood rituals to portend future events and invoke magic.
Halloween.
You don't know that for sure.  It could have been anyone.  A practical joke. Kids.
What's wrong?  What's happened to Jamie?
What do you know about Michael?
Hm?
I hope the men do.  I would rather the women didn't.
At least!
You know what gets me?
Go home!
When I drive it, I feel like I'm in the middle of a great big wad of bubblegum.  I don't hear anything, I don't feel anything.  I figure somebody else is driving.  It's a bitch.
I know, I know.  I dunno.  At least she's in the same house.  Sure was spooky, looking in the window there, and there she was.
How short the skirts are.
Go home!
How do you know that?
Really?
I told you the uniform wouldn't help.
I dunno.
What's this?
I didn't like that violin thing. That was sad.
Me?
If what?
If I hadn't done it.  If I'd said to myself, "Screw it.  I'm going to let all those people down there live."
Selling vacuum cleaners isn't the best preparation you could have.
What?
As a matter of fact--I am home.
Hello.
Hello.
You don't know where your mother is? Does she put on a short skirt and go drinking all night?
And you've been roaming the streets while your mother is God-knows-where?
Everybody says he was so brave.
He worships Father.
She has a master's degree in English literature.
Aha!  He has a brilliant military record, I'm sure.
Dad was never in England?
Hid by day--fought by night.  At sunset one day, your father and I, peering through field glasses, saw a black Mercedes draw up to a village inn.  It was escorted by two motorcyclists and an armored car.  Out of the Mercedes stepped one of the most hateful men in all of history--the Beast of Yugoslavia.
We came up behind a sentry, and your father slit his throat before he could utter a sound.
Uck.
When I grow up, I'm going to go to Mhravitch.
Sir?
Alive and hale.  He's throwing a little surprise party for his own family.  Is your mother often this unstable?  Penelope!
The smallest thing I've got.
A hundred dollars for breakfast?
What kind of exercise?
We've got to do something to make this boy's voice change.  I wonder if we couldn't get bull balls somewhere, and fry 'em up.  Still miss your mother?
No.
Then speak, by God!  Can you fight with words?
Raw hamburger, please--and a whole onion.  I want to eat the onion like an apple.  Do you understand?
Not at all.
Disease?
A telegram--a phone call might have helped.
Please--
Now that's what I call fun.
I have a brain.
Mrs. Wheeler is dead.
I'd like to have the expert opinion of the fish--along with yours.
Go on.
The doctor.
And what is his most cherished possession?
Yes.
He did his best to destroy my most precious possession, which is the high opinion women have of me.  I'm now going to even that score.  I'm going to break in his door and I'm going to smash his violin.
Your clothes are at the city dump by now.  Perhaps you can get a map from the Department of Sanitation.
You took him to the funeral, I hear.
Money?  There's plenty of that. Mildred got the brewery.  You'll probably get the baseball team.
He's in East St. Louis with his mother--visiting an aunt.
I mean it!
Help your mother find the bullet.
The National Safety Council would be appalled.
Give me that Goddamn thing!  Now get out of here, or I might kill you.  Who knows?
Of course he can go--if he'll just go down on his hands and knees for a moment--and promise me that he does not find me comical in the least degree.
The door ws unlocked.  Is it always unlocked?
You're--you're old friends of Harold Ryan?
We tried to be.  We tried to be.
Look--I'm sorry--I have to go.
And still Mrs. Harold Ryan?
You wish the woman good luck, and you tell the man how fortunate he is.  That's how it goes.
Safe and sound, I see.  Oh--you came back.
You can also describe its cure. I'm eating its cure.
Would you say that again?
I'm going to have to report you to the Department of Health.
A living fossil!  Like the cockroaches and the horseshoe crabs.
Evolution has made you a clown-- with a cigar.  Simple butchers like you are obsolete!
In any event, I will not beg for mercy.
I put a poisoned thought in your head.  Even now that poison is seeping into every lobe of your mind.  It's saying, "Obsolete, obsolete, obsolete," and, "Clown, clown, clown."
I--I really must congratulate you. Something is happening in there.
I see.
I'm utterly satisfied.
She married an accountant named Stanley Kestenbaum.
Mr. Ryan just borrowed my birthday cake.  I don't really know him.
That is sad.
I don't care what she wears.
Don't worry about it.
You bet I'll worry about it.  I said something wrong?
It's my father's birthday--that's all.  That's all.  Who cares about that?
She doesn't care!  She's not married any more!  She's going to have fun!  I hope you have so much fun you can hardly stand it.  Dr. Woodly--I hope you make up even better jokes about my father than the ones you've said so far.
I worship your father.  That stuffed alligator your mother gave me--the one he shot?  It's the proudest thing in my apartment.
Don't touch me.
Not true.
I hate that thing.
I don't get it.
Then get him.
He's not anybody to tell somebody else what to do in a master bedroom.
Doing what?
If you want to wrestle, you got Lehigh.  If you want to play tennis, you go to Vanderbilt.
That's when I'll get my confidence back.
I figure he ducked in one place and ducked out another.
Then I saw this bakery store that was still open, so I bought a birthday cake.
Marry me instead.
You're saying no.
I'm saying no--and thank you.
I must take you to an emergency ward sometime--on a Saturday night. That's also fun.  I came to see Selma, as a matter of fact.
They made her so sleepy she couldn't work.
This is very good for us.
The only thing I ever told him about life was, "Keep out of the park after the sun goes down."
Why would you do that?
He can make the sound of human footsteps--which is a terrifying sound.
We've got to rescue him.
No.  But he's going to be.  If he is in the park and he comes out safely on the other side, I can say to him, "You and I are the only men with balls enough to walk through the park at midnight."  On that we can build.
You know each other?
I'm taking her to the airport a few minutes from now.  She's going to East St. Louis--to visit an aunt.
Hi kid.  Would you look what the car dragged in.
I'm glad you brought your vacuum cleaner.
Or get eaten alive.
None of my relatives are Chinese Communists.  Speak for yourself.
You think you're so funny.  You're not even funny.  Right?  Right?  You don't hurt yourself if you start out slow.
If he'd just get into scouting, and camp out some, and see how everybody roughhouses around the fire--
What a beautiful demonstration this is of the utter necessity of rites of passage.
Walt Disney, who gave us Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs, plays shuffleboard.  Jesus Christ plays shuffleboard.
No. I don't think so.
There's no evidence of any foul play at present. I hope she's just a runaway.
I heard you the first time. We had nothing to go on with this kid. Just a runaway.  Do you really think he's in danger?
Yeah.
I just want to ask some questions.
Pull out your cock.
Are you going to stiff me?
How many weeks?
Yeah.
...the disciplines: bondage, domination and humiliation.
Man, how many girls do you need?
What do you think of this... ah, shade of blue, Mary.
No, that would be much too overpowering.
Kristen went on that convention today, didn't she?
Sure. Like in Mikey and Niki. Did you see that picture?
Joanne?
Okay. My client pays for it anyway.
You don't drink?
Yeah.  I'm her father.
Her name is Kristen. She disappeared a couple of months ago.
She's dead.
You don't understand shit.
Tod was.  He was with Ratan.
You really believe all that?
Why do you say that?
I don't blame you, Niki. Really I don't. It's this culture, where everything's based on sex, sold on sex...  ...magazines, music, TV. It's destroying everything. Buy this 'cause of sex, use this 'cause of sex. Kids think it's normal. They think they're supposed to talk dirty, wear scanty clothes...
Andy.
No, I didn't think she was. Let me get the picture here. Let me guess. She was an absolutely clean girl, a model daughter, she never had rebellious or impure thoughts, she didn't fuck around...
This used to be a real city. I was here about fifteen years ago. Embezzlement case. It was always a little religious for my taste, but at least it was a city. With a downtown and all.
I don't know.
No.
I don't know.
Get out.
It's just a name.
Don't do anything more. I'll find out what I can.
Is Marsha there?
What?
What plan?
Yeah.
What you got in mind?
You're talking about real excitement?
I don't know no Ratan, but I may be able to help you out. It's not me, of course. Just helping out a friend. It'll cost you five hundred bucks for a single screening.
Take it or leave it.
I want to know where my daughter is. Her name is Kristen, or Joanne. She's with you.
You wait here. I'll find out where she is.
But I...
You don't want anything for your fifty cents?
In other words, you want to get laid?
Hold it, mister.
What's that?
I'm staking out this beer bottle. Trying to find out if I'll finish it or it'll finish me.
I'm worried about Jake.
Granville's looking for you anyway.
The guy who bought you that ring.
I'm still in L.A., but I'm looking for Tod. I heard he was around.
You are at the University, Candy?
Could I see your registration?
Oh, well. Must have been your brother.
How interesting.
Eh, no.
Oh, of course. What is your name?
What?
Yes.
Your hearse?
Still, I think you'd upset people and I'm not sure that's right.
Sort of.
Oh, it's fine. Fine.
Subways... Perfume... Cigarette...  ... Cologne... Carpet... Chestnuts! ... <u>Snow!</u>
That's a nice teapot.
Because they are all the same.
What is that he's working on?
The ice is melting.
Oh.
Don't you advance on me.
Do you think there is any life up there?
It's all right. It's organic.
But why now?
Fay, I'll call you back.  What did you say?
This is insane.
Well, a rough estimate... I'd say fifteen.
I wouldn't say "benefit."
Does that worry you?
I'm sure. But what else do you do with your time? Do you go to school?
Harold?
I see.  Were you happy at school, Harold?
Yes.
Yes.
Why?
And so I ask you - why the hell did we give up on the Germans? Those damn politicians in Washington chalked them up on our side and the wars ever since have been a national disgrace. Hell, look at history. The two best wars this country has fought were against the Jerries. Now I say, get the Krauts on the other side of the fence where they belong, and let's get back to the kind of enemy worth killing and the kind of war this whole country can support.
Sure. Be able to tell your children. Something for them to look up to. Be proud of.
And to use the bayonet? PACHOIE!
Harold!
Harold, calm down! This is...
Oh, yes. How did you like that?
I knew you'd come.
Sad, huh? She's been here six months. Her name's TIFFANY.
O.K. Let's go.
You're in the Malahide Institute. It's a psychiatric hospital. But, hey, don't feel judged -- it was just the nearest place to bring you. Remember? You and your boyfriend...?
Steve...
I need to touch it to "see"...
Story of my life.
"Paranormal"  But -- you read the transmission.
The freak in the gas mask --
Do you believe in hell?
Grigory -- That's Russian, right?  Thought they were on our side...
Me?? C'mon --
1958, the occult war finally ends when Adolf Hitler dies.
And as a father, I worry about him.  In medieval stories, Agent Myers, there's often a young knight, inexperienced but pure of heart...
Who's the squirt?
Got tired of me?
It is. You got yourself on TV again.
You will never fulfill your destiny. You will never understand the power inside you.
"One falls, two shall arise." So: you pop one, two come out. You kill two, you get four. You kill four, you're in trouble. We have to nail 'em all at once. And the eggs.
Those things never work. Never.
You'd better stay here. I'll find a way out. We'll come back for you.
Thank you.
Wait -- Wait -- You can't go anywhere -- I gotta go with you --
No. I never was.
Not from you.
You better have that looked at.
I like that...
A brute.
But it's not true, is it?
-- Section fifty-one. Step back.
You fucking ass-holes.
This isn't for real.
Let me alone, will you?
Nobody escapes us.
That's easily arranged. But first, back into bed.
Well can I come in or not?
What about Larry --
Wedded bliss?
You can't let me stay like this. Please. You can't.
Well?
I want an explanation first. I want to know what happened to you.
It gave me a little chance, and I took it. They won't get me back. I'm going to live, and you're going to help me. Yes?
Hi. I got soaked.
I was here this afternoon.
Not exactly modern.
Please...
I don't know where to begin...
Please.
You know it's not often I... you know...
Do you care ?
You know, you're very beautiful.
What a pretty tune.
Well, if you change your mind. What's this friend's name?
Where are you?
It's not a gesture. I want to do this on my own. Come on, trust me a little will you?
You like?
Upstairs.  Treat her gently, huh? She hates moving.
What are you drinking, love?
Really?
Would you... maybe call round sometime? Try to make friends.
I have to talk to you.
Poor Frank. He's better off dead.
Yes!
We're on the Cointreau.
You're not going?
If there's a train.
Are you alright ?
I'm sorry, I shouldn't have surprised you.
TURN IT OFF, BARRY.
Barry, I'm fucking broke!  I know we used to fuck with anyone who asked for anything we didn't like, but it's gotta stop.
I'm not snickering.  I'm smiling. Because I'm happy.
Oh no, Rob, that's not obvious enough. Not at all.  Dick, did you hear that?
...But the word "yet..." Yeah, you know what, I'd get the impression that you wanted to see it.  Otherwise you'd say you didn't really want to.
What the fuck is that?
Haven't seen it.
Oh.  Right.  But I'd forgotten about that.  I wasn't biting the idea.
What?
I'll give you 10% of the door if you don't play.
110%.  That's my final offer.  I'm not kidding.  That's how much it means to me not to hear you play.
Holy Shiite!  What the fuck's this?
He's got one!
A couple blocks!  About six!
Don't do it, Rob!
Oh, hi.
Uh.  That's me.
I'm Caroline Fortis from The Reader. I want to do a story on you.
Nevermind.  Any five.  So four more.
Yeah.
And the new label?  And the Kinky Wizards?
Hey Rob.
Hey.  Didn't you steal that one already?
I've ah... got some other stuff to tell him anyway, so it's no problem. I'll just tell him about, you know, Laura, when I tell him the other stuff.
Let's not.
Liz, hold on a second --  What?
Rob --!
Laura?  Are you okay?
Maybe I should talk to him.
Mmmm, no.  Not a good idea.
Come on, Rob.  My relationship with Laura has obviously disturbed you a great deal.
Good.  So shall we leave it at that then?
So shall we leave it at that then?
Hi.
-- Alright, alright but --
So you weren't interested in music at all?
Good.  So.  Is it my job?
What?  Gimme a fucking break.  Is that what you think?  That your not big enough a deal for me?  Jesus, gimme a little credit, Rob.
Just the obvious stuff.
What's the obvious stuff?
I am not living with him.  I've just been staying with him for a few days until I work out what I'm doing. Look, this has nothing to do with anyone else.  You know that, don't you?  I left because we weren't exactly getting along, and we weren't talking about it.  And I suddenly realized that I like my job, and I like what my life is could be turning into, and that I'm getting to a point where I want to get my shit together and I can't really see that ever happening with you, and yeah, yeah, I sort of get interested in someone else, and that went further than it should have, so it seemed like a good time to go.  But I have no idea what will happen with Ian in the long run.  Probably nothing.
Just ask it!
You really think it would make a difference either way?
I figured it was.  Where are you?
I'm not experimenting.  Why don't you go experiment.
Those look heavy.  Where's Ian?
Ray.  I hate Ian.
Sure they are.
Liz'll give you a lift.  She knows where to go and everything... I don't have time to talk, Rob.  I've got too much to do.
You're soaking.
No, no.  It's not... are you still on the pill?
Yes, of course.  There's nothing to worry about.
And hairstyles and clothes and attitude and friends and...
Hi.
Hi.  What are you doing?
What are you going to talk to me about?
Ha ha ha.  Hoo hoo hoo.
I mean it.
Rob here.
Hey.  It's Liz.
Enough, Liz.
I know I can't speak now because Laura's father died, and I just have to take it because otherwise I'm a bad guy, with the emphasis on guy, self-centered.  Well, I'm fucking not, not all the time, anyway, I'm really sorry Jo.  But you know, Liz... I can either stick up for myself or believe everything you say about me and end up hating myself.  And maybe you think I should, but it's not much of a life, you know?
Good.  'Cause I'm enjoying myself.
She just wanted to pick up some stuff. No big thing.  A relief, actually.
God, I hate that time.  That pick up stuff time.  I just went through that before I came here.  You know that song "Patsy Cline Times Two" I play?  That's about me and my ex dividing up our record collections.
Are you okay?
Would you like me to turn the lights out?  Or would you like them on?
What did Laura say?  Do you know why she left?
Suit yourself.  There are plenty of others who will.
I'm sorry but I think you better talk to someone else.
Sure.  Ten cents.
I think you have more.
Wait a minute.  Island Records charged U2 a million five against their overhead for one plane ride.
Maybe he's hiding from something.
Figured you knew more about swords than I did.
Claymore.
I've been trying to find somebody who knew him and any connections his family might have had with museums or historical societies.
Have you spoken to anyone else about this?
Yes.
Charming guy, Basil.  Once after beating an army of Serbians he blinded all but-
You needn't worry Miss Cartwright. I've been at this a very long time.
What about me?
He sees me as a threat.
No.  I had to talk to you.
I go my way and you can write all you want about the big bad Mr. Taupin.
You make it all sound so simple.
Yes.
They do it each year.
William Taupin seems to have left his mark.
I see.
I'm not even sure why.
My life has been chock full of people with complications and weak- nesses.  I can't stand it.  But you're different.  It's in your hands.  A clarity.
Perhaps.  There is something more. An inheritance.
There are differences.
I haven't killed _you_.
What is it you want?
It will be horrible.  The future.  I may die tomorrow or 10,000 tomorrows. I can promise you nothing.  Nothing but a moment.  Maybe two.  But a moment of love, is that not worth a lifetime?
You better have a warrant.  That's my notebook, you've got no right to be sticking your fingers into it.
But we might just give it the 'ole college try.  What with the court back ups, it could be days before you got an arraignment. But then, I'm sure the flunk-out neice of the D.A. knows all about that.
It's bullshit.  Everything. My job, the people I get involved with, I'm up to here with it.
Someone should check him out. Maybe a collection somewhere got knocked over.  He has one, he might have two.
Stop.
Juan Cid Romirez.  Chief surveyor and alchemist.
And but for a mark you are well as any man, no?
In my travels I heard the story of the MacLeod boy struck down and brought from the hand of death by powers not of this Earth.
Do you ever feel a flow, as if some- thing were pushing against you?
It is less.
Why does he want to kill me?
How can I stop such a man?
Harder!  You swing like an impotent cow!
And you?
I am a small player.  But if by helping you I can keep that monster from being the last, then perhaps my life has meant something.
You must be.  You have responsibilities. You must learn the rules.  You can never attract attention to yourself, never show the side that will draw others to you.  You will always know when you are in the presence of another.  Beware. But more importantly Conor MacLeod, will be your battle against time.  In the coming years you will see kingdoms rise then rot like wheat.  People will become a transitory, pathetic lot.  The only constant you will know will be the others and the tradition their greed and quest represent.  But life without morality, without the ability to truly taste the sweetness of wine and love, is no life at all.  That is how the others exist.  Nothing more than walking corpses living only to slaughter each other in an insane quest to be the last.  Keep your soul sewed to the earth.  Do not become one of them.
You cannot be real, Conor.  You had the last rites.  No man has been cut half as bad and lived.
I'll not take that kind of talk from you.  From those others below, maybe.  But not from you.
No doubt.
Our common heritage.  I am your only real friend, you know.  The only one who truly understands you.  I look forward to the day we meet again.  And I kill you.
Where did you learn that?
I don't know.
And the Bulgarian?
He got him.  He always does.  Eventually.
Not tonight.  Tonight I have a drink with an old friend.
I'll never forget the look on that Papal commander's face when his "heretic stronghold" turned out to be a rock full of whores climbing all over Neuvich.
Neuvich, the clown of the crusades.
No, seriously.  We used to shoot pool together in Rangoon.
How do you do it, Kahn?  How do you live so full of life for so long?
You're wrong.
Friend of yours?
Of sorts.
Are you here?
This your present address?
Mr.-  Taupin, what were you doing in that alley?
Did you know the victim?
His name was Iman Fasil if that jogs your memory.
It doesn't.
Two days ago a Bulgarian national was murdered the same way.  He'd also been in the country less than a week.  What is your citizenship?
What were _you_ looking for?
A mystery.
The money in the estate was enough to cover your costs?
Sure take after him.  Never seen a father and son look more alike.
No.
This is Murphy. More slop on the hanging.
Are you back?
Of course!  Roy Bensinger, the poet. Of course you wouldn't know! You probably never heard of Shakespeare, either! Put Mr. Bensinger right on the staff.  How much are you getting on the Tribune, Roy?
I'll keep you in mind.
I'd like to spoil him just once. Sure you don't want me to go in with you?
Wait a minute, Bruce. What's commission on a $100,000.00 policy?
Well, at his age, twenty payment life, a little over a thousand dollars.
What's the matter?
I lost my wallet.
Did you finish the interview?
No -- but I'm sure it'll be all right with Walter.
I know I got you into this, Hildy, but it does seem to me that you can't care much for me if you're willing to let me stay locked up for two hours.
No, I was going to give it to her -- but she left hurriedly.
Here it is, Bruce. One -- two -- three -- four hundred -- and fifty dollars.
I've just told you I was busy with Mr. Bruce Baldwin!
Mr. -- well -- no -- no -- not at all.
Attaboy!  Come on, Bruce.
I sometimes wish I'd taken out insurance -- but, of course, now it doesn't matter. Still, I suppose it would have been the smart thing to do.
Figure it this way: I ought to be good for twenty-five years. By that time, you'll probably have made enough so that the money won't mean anything. But suppose you haven't made good -- don't you think Hildy's entitled to a quiet old age without any worries?
You'll ask me to what?
Save that for the Tribune.
You know, Hildy, I sort of wish you hadn't done it.
Done what?
A fellow your age, hiring an airplane to write:  'Hildy: Don't be hasty -- remember my dimple. Walter.! It held things up twenty minutes while the Judge ran out to watch it.
Deny it! I'm proud of it! We beat the whole country on that story.
Let's not fight, Hildy. Tell you what. You come back to work on the paper and if we find we can't get along in a friendly way, we'll get married again.
What?!!
Just what I said. That's what I --
You mean you're not coming back to work here?
You wouldn't have taken me if I hadn't been doll-faced!
Sweeney?  Well, after all, he didn't do it on purpose, did he?
Don't mock, Hildy, this is bigger than anything that's happened to us. Don't do it for me! Do it for the paper.
Get married all you want to, Hildy, but you can't quit the newspaper business.
I don't know about water buffaloes, but I know about him. He's kind and sweet and considerate. He wants a home -- and children.
Say, sounds more like a guy I ought to marry. What's his name?
Then what does he want with you?
If he's nuts, why doesn't the State just put him away?
What tricks would I pull?
Exclusive? That's great.
No kidding, Hildy.  Say, this isn't a rib?
It better be fifteen minutes, because Bruce is waiting downstairs in a taxicab and that meter's clicking away to beat the band.
I know, but --
You know! You've got the brain of a pancake! That wasn't just a story you covered -- it was a revolution! Hildy! This is the greatest yarn in journalism since Livingstone discovered Stanley for the New York Herald! 
Well, keep going! We want an extra out on the streets before it's too late!
What happened?
It's Fate, Hildy. What will be, will be.
I'm looking at you -- you murderer!
How was that for a tight squeeze?
Worried! I was petrified. Weren't you?
Yeah. What about the time we hid the missing heiress in the sauerkraut factory? Six scoop interviews!
Where'd you wire him?
Walter!
What's the good of arguing about something that probably doesn't exist? Look, Hildy, I'm proposing to you. What do you say?
How about Bruce's?
Yes -- 'Hildy, darling'. I'm just a fool. That's what I am. I know what it's going to be like.
What do you mean, I handed her? The patrol wagon was on the wrong side of the street.
Beat it out and get hold of some guys.
You got plenty of money?
Walter!
Let's see the money.
Mollie Malloy -- what happened to her?
You ain't gettin' out o' here!
Oh, nothing much. Just that the state had proved he was sane -- and he admits it himself. If you don't want me to run it --
What is it?
They got him!  Wait a minute -- hold the wire.  They got Earl Williams surrounded -- the Riot Squad has -- in his house.
Hold your horses -- will you, Olsen? Hurry up, Fred!
Shoot to kill, I said.
Take those handcuffs off our friends, Pete. That wasn't at all necessary.
I hope you're pretty nearly through with me, Doctor, I'm getting a little fatigued.
But, Hildy, I can't. He's accused of stealing a watch. And they found the watch on him.
Don't Hildy me! Are you going to let him out?
Gentlemen of the Press! Always picking on somebody who can't defend himself -- the littler the better.
There goes another scrub lady.
Well, Hildy, we were only saying that a swell reporter like you wouldn't give this up so easily.
You didn't mean to kill that policeman?
How would you go about applying the Golden Rule, Earl?
A gun?  Why -- to shoot, of course.
Very simple, Earl.
Sure you could, Earl -- but you wouldn't want to do that, would you? You wouldn't want to kill anybody.
I don't blame you, Earl.  If I were in your place I wouldn't trust anybody, either.
They're newspaper men, Mollie. They can't help themselves. The Lord made them that way.
Quiet, Mollie!
They'll get him! They'll get him!
What do you want?
Yes, I did, just now. Don't you remember?
Who? Me?
Here's the picture of my wife.
What's your hurry?
What's he want?
I know.
I never was.
I know a secret.
What's that?
You want to join our gang?
Sod.
Go and ask her if she wants to play.
Ask her yourself.
What is it?
Could you seal it over with hot pitch, Clive? Caulk it like the hull of a ship.
Never done better. On the fiddle. Like everyone else.
We all had to write a last letter home.
Oh, that.
Well, it's off ration. We know that.
I doubt if a few bombs would wake up Dawn on a Sunday morning.
The ideas you get in your head.
I want him. I want him so much. I'll kill myself if I can't have him.
No, Mother! It's War! War!
Bless you, Mac. What would I have done without you?
To Mary McDonald, Thelma Richardson, Bobo Hinds, Lily Sanderson...  ...Little Sarah Whats-it, now there was a spirit. And Marjorie Anderson.
I don't know how you cope, Grace. Three kids, army pay. On your own.
I'm so glad you could come. Here we are, all together again.
Deadwood, is that what it's called? Cool, will you show us?
Who's your Daddy!
Where's that?
Don't worry, I'll be right back.
How much further?
He left!
Oh. Maybe R.J. got into a crash and killed everbody?
Wondering what?
Are you two gals all funny with each other?
Take that, you fucking slut!  Fucking redneck whore!
You all sure are buying a lot of holy water for two people.
I'll bet you do... how much we owe ya...  ...Goober?
Actually it's G. Ober... Gerry Ober, but the guys drew in the other O, fucking assholes.
Shit, I don't remember exactly. I took over for my Pa just after the Duke nabbed the Oscar.
I don't drive cross country.
I'll let it slide, she was only seventeen.
Don't panic yourself, way too much caffeine guy... I see a sign.  Captain Spaulding's Museum of Madmen and Monsters... cool. Also... fried chicken and... gasoline... next exit.
How awesome?
I'm not exactly sure... it looks close. Did we pass an abandoned school bus yet?
Come on, we need something like this. It could be the real deal. It's too far out of the way to come back to.
She looks like she stinks.
Thanks.
I can't believe what I'm seeing.
We'll need pictures of the inside too.
Hey, he moved.
Screw that, no way, I ain't letting you go by yourself.
What are you doing!
I gotta open the gate.
Come on, get with the facts.
What'd you see, who was she with, where were they going?
Hmmmmm.
What?
Hey, maybe she knows where this is?
Yeah, in this book there's a chapter called Self Made Freaks about how people would mutilate themselves in order to work in a freak show. It mostly talks about tattooed people and wild men of Borneo and shit like that, but there is one mention of a single case where a woman was suspected of having her arms removed on purpose to become an arm-less wonder.
Blah, blah, blah... it doesn't say, but she was released sometime in 1937, only to reappear as Ellie Bogdan, the arm-less wonder. Says she, "criss-crossed the United States constantly in carnivals and freak shows until her death in 1946."
Think, think. Try to open the lid, try to kick a hole in the wood.
I can't... I can't move my arms. I hurt so much.
Too late. You're in for life, let's move it out Private Shutterbug.
You got to be fucking joking.
What was that?
I don't hear anything.
Don't be such a fucking smart ass.
Shit, I wonder what these kids did to bring this much hell down on 'em.
Well Christ boy, don't stand there like a prize dog dick with his butthole caught up a tree.
So, what brings you kids way out here, ain't you got something better to do for Halloween than wander around out here in the sticks?
For the show. It's Halloween eve and time for our show.
I'm gonna go ask him.
Just back up.
I'm with Denise, can't we just walk to someplace, this is getting fucking stupid.
Sorry.
I appreciate your cooperation. I'm looking for a missing girl...  ...this girl here, Denise Willis... have you seen her?
Think... do any of these kids look familiar in any way?
What should I do?
Who's your Daddy!
Turn up this road.
That is the wrong fork, young man.  Harold, tell the boy.
Hello, my little boy.
Oui.
Is everything fine?
It's nice, yes. I'm glad I ran into you, both in our silly pajamas. It is two happy coincidences, no?
Really? No. Not at all. You're a very pretty girl. You should know that. You should be confident.
Unnhh.
The way you are taming him, it sends chills down my girlish spine and... everywhere else, too.
Yeah? What?
No!
Hunh.
Lila?
Yes, please, somebody ask him what is wrong.
I want our boy back.
We still have you and I.
Very well.
What do you mean?
Somehow it came up that you were a friend of mine. Mr. handsome, animal- loving psychologist said he would love to meet you.
No maid service! For God's sake, can't you read the fucking "do not disturb" sign on the fucking doorknob?
Go the fuck away, Rosie.
I hope you don't perform any of those dreadful torture experiments, Nathan.
You do?
Yes, and...
It's just that I have some peculiarities, and...
What SPF, sweetie?
Come on.
I don't understand you. This is fascinating and you just want to run away. I mean, here we have a human being totally uncontaminated by civilization, totally free, and all you want to do is run back to your...
What?
Feral, huh? Totally uncontaminated?
It's perfect!
You have to shave? Like an ape?
I love being female because it, how do you say, allows me to be close to men.
Oh, baby. I'm sorry. Can't you hire somebody else?
Have you?
I'm going to go down and check on Puff. See how he's holding up.
So he's doing okay?
I gave up my soul, my beliefs. I gave up my body hair!
How the hell would you know anything about the human heart?
I bow to your expertise in these matters.
And because you did so well, we have a little surprise for you.
Unka unka unka unka unka.
So anyway, that's the nightmare I've been having lately.
No, why?
Well, it seems that since Lila broached the subject of children, you've been on edge and I know you have an issue with the, uh, body hair.
Yes, I suppose so. I suppose I knew that was going to be what you would say. It's good to see you again though.
Pittsburgh?
About sixty, seventy bucks.
Give me some bourbon. J. T. S. Brown.
That's right, Miss Packard.
No, there's no tomorrow. Not with you. You own all the tomorrows because you buy them today, and you buy cheap.
You bastard.
Stay with this kid. He's a loser.
Yeah? Why?
You're damned right I'm sure. Everybody's got talent. I got talent. You think you can play big-money straight pool, or poker, for forty straight hours on nothing but talent? You think they call Minnesota Fats the best in the country just 'cause he's got talent? Nah. Minnesota Fats's got more character in one finger than you got in your whole skinny body.
That's your problem.
A thousand.
Sure, you got drunk. That's the best excuse in the world for losing. No trouble losing when you got a good excuse. And winning! That can be heavy on your back too. Like a monkey. You drop that load too when you got an excuse. All you gotta do is learn to feel sorry for yourself. It's one of the best indoor sports: feeling sorry for yourself -- a sport enjoyed by all, especially the born losers.
Ten reasons. Maybe fifteen. And also there's something in it for me.
For me.
How much you think you're worth these days? I'm puttin' up the money, I'm puttin' up the time. For that I get seventy-five per cent return on my money -- if you win.
I never saw you do anything else.
Now, when did you adopt me?
Hello, Eddie.
Maybe you oughta give me lessons.
I don't. But I got confidence in Findley.
Good. I'd hate to think I was putting my money on a cripple.
C'mon, Bert. Let me play him.
Bert, if that's his best game, I can beat him.
It's a long walk.
I got time, Bert.
Tell her what?
Yeah, that's right.
Just tell me where I can find him, friend.
Why?
Looks more like a morgue to me. Those pool tables are the slabs they lay the stiffs on.
Approximately? One thousand bucks.
Ah, get with it, will ya, Charlie?
Get with what?
Give me a drink, will ya?
I want you to come back on the road with me.
You're very direct, Mr. Felson.
Charles, will you call a cab for these gentlemen, please.  I'd show you to the door, but I...
Oh yeah, yeah. You're tired.  And beat.
Who's he?
Gimme ten bucks.
Call it.
You better not miss, friend.
How long you been waiting?
Have a nice trip.
Why not? We already know each other's secrets.
Two ships that pass in the night should always buy each other breakfast.
I'm a college girl. Two days a week, Tuesdays and Thursdays, I go to college.
No. No more. I'm getting sleepy.  Thank you very much, Mr...?
Thanks.
You got it all in your head?
Eddie, what's in that case?
You going out?
Sarah, do you think I'm a loser?
A loser?
No.  Yes, I want to know what for. But I don't want to ask.
I'm going to Kentucky. To Louisville. With a friend. Try to make some money. I need it, the money. I'll be leaving early in the morning.
Leave now.
Oh, grow up.
He went off someplace.
California. Oakland.
Well, you shoot big-time pool, Fats. I mean, that's what everybody says, you shoot big-time pool. Let's make it two hundred dollars a game.
I can't live like you do -- all your machines and -- cold metal and sharp corners --
Yes.
You are The Human.  The Hunter.  The thing that comes in the day and kills --
Have you always had it?
That's who you are too, Emma.
Tell me about the interesting people you met, won't you?
I surrender --
I'm am architect.  I'm working on a site back in --
I lost it.  It's kind of muddy out there.
I'm home now.
I got trapped in Mrs. McKeltch's van -- and she went to the tunnel and went down there with them -- behind my house.  I saw them.
They'll get us.
Who are you calling?
What?
When?
His teacher brought him in to see me. Said he'd been acting up in class. Creating a disturbance.  I couldn't get a thing out of him.
Jimmy's father is on the phone.  I wonder if you'd take the call.
I've worked with embedded loading. They're communicating with a hidden signal. They're going to attack...
What?
Better be. You left me for him.
With you? I don't understand why you can't just show someone how to plant the virus, somebody trained for this kind of mission?
I don't know how you put up with him.
What's the bad news?
No. The good news is I found the problem and it's not our equipment. There's some weird signal embedded within the satellite feed.
You have any idea how long it takes for those things to decompose?
Dad, don't start.
Because last time I saw him I punched him in the face.
This I can see.
Must be thousands of them. What are they doing?
Sir, what happens if they do become hostile?
Atlanta, Chicago and Philadelphia, destroyed?
And our forces?
Get on the horn with Atlantic Command. Let's upgrade the situation to DEFCON 3.
This is crazy. We're loosing our first strike capabilities!
It had been deemed classified.
You can't go. Call them back.
What?
Really? You don't mind?
You're late.
Before we do this, I want you to know I'm sorry.
Yeah, but what an entrance!
Really? Ballet?
Dylan, come here. I want you to meet the First Lady.
That is an affirmative. I have victory dance. Mmmmmmm.
Damn it!
Stop it.
It's all fuzzy.
What the hell's going on?
Above American soil?
Why the hell wasn't I told about this place?
The other bombers might have more luck. We shouldn't just give up...
And before here?
Can we negotiate a truce? Is there room for co-existance?  Can there be peace between us?
Venice, Italy!
Call Donovan, Marcus. Tell him I'll take that ticket to Venice now.
Tapestries?
I know who you are Mr. Donovan. Your contributions to the museum over the years have been extremely generous. Some of the pieces in your collection here are very impressive.
Hard to resist, isn't it? The Holy Grail's final resting place described in detail!
I've heard this one as well. Two of these brothers walked out of the desert one hundred and fifty years after having found the Grail and began the long journey back to France. But only one of them made it. And before dying of extreme old age, he supposedly imparted his tale to a -- to a Franciscan friar, I think.
DONOVAN!
As what? A Nazi stooge like you?
Yes?
But I'm already sad -- by tomorrow it will have faded.
Are you sure?
I said go around!
My room!
What are you going to do?
No, Dad. You listen to me --
Take it easy?! Why do you think I sent it home in the first place?  So it wouldn't fall into their hands!!
I came here to save you.
Booby traps?
I don't know. The first available flight out of Germany.
When we're airborne, with Germany behind us, then I'll share that sentiment.
We didn't talk. We never talked.
Did I ever tell you to eat up? Go to bed? Wash your ears? Do your homework? No. I respected your privacy and I taught you self-reliance.
Then what are you complaining about?  Look, we have work to do. When we get to Alexandretta we will face three challenges.  "First, the breath of God. Only the penitent man will pass. Second, the Word of God, only in the footsteps of God will he proceed. Third, the Path of God, only in the leap from the lion's head will he prove his worth."
Penitent. Penitent...
Junior, give me your other hand! I can't hold on!!
That car belonged to my brother-in- law.
I'll take the camels.
I don't need camels.
Why are you trying to kill us?
This is your last chance.
You think so?
Hard to believe, isn't it...?
His Highness has not yet taken a wife.
Lost? No, we're not lost. We're on our way to Delhi. This is Miss Scott -- and Mr. Round. My name's Indiana Jones.
We'd appreciate it if the Maharajah would let us stay tonight. We'll be on out way in the morning.
There are no stories anymore.
You know the villagers also claimed that this palace stole something from them.
When they lost this rock their fields and animals died. They also said their children were taken from them.
So, it is true, Dr. Jones? You found Nurhachi?
Indy, look!
Next time I flatten him! Did you see his eyes?
Slow on the curves or we'll fly off the tracks!
No. They are here -- somewhere. A century ago when the British raided this temple and butchered my people, a loyal priest hid the last two stones down here in the catacombs.
Hasn't the Pankot palace been deserted since the Mutiny of 1857?
Me seduce you? Honey, you're the one who took your clothes off.  I just came over to remind you that you never know what else might be in the water.
Just one arm!
Yes, stroke it right along the maxillary and precaudal vertebrae.
THE WHAT?!
By the way, how'd you end up in Shanghai?
I think you should sleep closer.  I meant for safety.
You're dying to come into my room, aren't you?
Too proud to admit you're crazy about me, Dr. Jones?
We'll see who gives in first -- I'll leave my door open.
Oh no -- oh no!!
Oh my God! He ripped out his -- he killed him!
I'm not leaving without those stones.
They don't cry about you. They cry about the elephants leaving.
Figures...
I said something.
Arrrgh!
Who?
You're in my head...
I just went there for a job.
Hear voices don't I.
You're gonna explain.
I'll tell you what to say.
What'd he look like?
Yeah...Who is?
You're the one talking to a little guy in your head.  ...We'll have to do it on our own.
Thanks.
That's it. They know I'm in here. We've got to find them.
Wait a minute. The fight. Where did he get you?
I'll be out of touch for a while. Just get to the airport.
I'm back.
I don't have any.
Use my credit cards.
What's wrong with how I carry myself.
The beach.
The beach?
The sky, the sun, the sea... There's no one here. It's deserted. What now?
What was?
Which language?
...Joe.
Well you did it today.
But what's it look like?
Much too blue.
What did that cost?
Get close to them.
You're not just after this girl, are you?
I feel like an idiot.
Even Rene?
No. What do you hope? AL  I hope. I just hope. That someday, you're real small, and you've got no time. And you got no one to help you. And you depend on me. And you know what I'll do?
You been had. We have.
Follow her.
What do I do?
...drink it.
Ow!
I can't see a thing.
I need a guide and you need a client...and $1000.
Plenty of circuits in a Walkman...
He hung us up dry.
Then, why'd he lead us here.
Aim just in front of his face.
Holy...
The man we want has the PEM, and is across the border by now.
What happened?
Be quiet.
Where've you been?
Never mind that, where are we now.
I have been... I think you're right.
Now, you're too suspicious.
I was wrong. She tried to help us get away.
It'll remind me of you.
Nice?
I knew you were trouble.
PEM115!
Who is your friend?
Your memory.
Was quite excited, when he came in...
Where?
And you.
I can't do that?
No. Ryuji just hires us.
Your friends, did they ask about me?
No, he didn't do that.
I'm not worried, I'm not going to eat it.
You know where he went?
He must be a good friend.
What'd he steal?
We figure out if it's in here.
Wait a minute! How'd you know Dieter was coming here?
Can you?
Yes. No. I'm...okay. They can't do this. They can't hold us here.
What a mess.
Doesn't matter. I'm on your side.
Must be a fulfilling occupation.
What could you find in this place?
Why'd you invite me here?
I have a seat. I've had it since nine.
Wait.
Why?
It's alright.
It'l be alright.
Screw the PEM...What about Al...
Look, nobody knows we did it.
That's great... Little early for cartoons, isn't it?
Did you see somebody or did you hear them?
Monday.
Push it.
These are their leads, their sources. I want you to have your reporters...
No. I'm not going to take "no" for an answer. No.
You think I put that bullet in the mailbox myself...?
What does that mean? "Rife with -- ?"
I'm told unusual promises were made to Wigand.
No, only that we would hold the story until it was safe for him...
How are you, Jim?
Hi, baby.
Here's how it works. You ask me questions. I tell you if you're wrong.
Yeah?
Lowell?
Did I tell you you were wrong?
I'm sorry, darling, have you seen my coffee mug...?
Soy sauce...
Why? Who said?
"60 Minutes," the television show?
Oh, someone took a poll? "Are all things Canadian boring...?"
No classes this morning?
"I'm Lowell Bergman, I'm from '60 Minutes.'" You know, you take the "60 Minutes" out of that sentence, nobody returns your phone call. Maybe Wigand's right. Maybe I'm hooked. What am I hooked on? The rush? "60 Minutes"? What the hell for? Infotainment. It's so fucking useless, all of it.
Alright?
Yeah.
Did I get you up?
But in all that time, Mike, did you ever get off a plane, walk into a room, and find that a source for a story changed his mind? Lost his heart? Walked out on us? Not one fucking time! You want to know why?
Oh, please, Mike...
Give me a break!
Yeah... Thank you.
C'mere. I want to talk to you.
This is my house... In front of my wife, my kids?! What business do we have?
How the hell do I know about Brown & Williamson?
It was on C-SPAN. Yeah.
You know, I was thinking of calling you tomorrow, anyway.  How are your kids handling the new house?
No, you said you were going to call me tomorrow. So, what about?
They're gonna dig up stuff from your past, they're gonna throw it at you. I got to know what they're gonna throw. You understand?
I drink. A couple of occasions more than I should have.  I was cited for shoplifting once. But it was a mistake...  I pushed Liane one time. We were both stressed out because of the pressure. She went to her mother's.  I got fired because when I get angry I have difficulty censoring myself. And I don't like to be pushed around!
You believe that?
I believe that? Yes, I believe that.
Jeff, call the FBI right away...
I called Richard Scruggs in Mississippi...
B & W may have threatened litigation... CBS is on the block...  But you, I mean, I know how...
I told the truth!
ABC...?
ABC Telemarketing Company.
I'm on a leave of absence. Forced vacation.
What's happening?!
We have a couple. One's hers, one's mine. Everybody uses a different name.  Modern marriage.  How's Liane?
Right.
You heard Mr. Sandefur say before Congress that he believed nicotine was not addictive...?
Part of the reason I'm here is I felt that their representation clearly misstated, at least within Brown & Williamson's representation, clearly misstated... what is common language within the company... we are in the nicotine delivery business.
The straw that broke the camel's back for me and really put me in trouble with Sandefur was a compound called "coumarin." When I came on board at B&W, they had tried to transition from coumarin to a similar flavor that would give the same taste, and had been unsuccessful. I wanted it out immediately. I was told that it would affect sales, so I should mind my own business. I constructed a memo to Mr. Sandefur indicating I could not in conscience continue with coumarin in a product that we now knew, we had documentation, was similar to coumadin, a lung-specific carcinogen...
And you sent the document forward to Sandefur?
"I would bet on it."
"You wish you hadn't blown the whistle?"
Okay.  I don't believe you can maintain corporate integrity without confidentiality agreements. I was paid well for my work. The health and welfare benefits are good. The severance package is fair. I have no intention of violating my confidentiality agreement and disclosing that which I said I wouldn't.
Miles, how nice of you to see us -- may I introduce Howard D. Doyle of Doyle Oil.
Harvard? Whoa, Daddy!
A Wriggle Room! Maybe we should put that in the Malibu house. Screw the screening room!
What part?
Who do you want me to kill?
Is that... one person?
Lemme tell you something. You are the pestilence. I'm the exterminator.
Grounds?
So. I won't be seeing her? Your clients usually visit me after the settlement.
It's a LeCoultre Revers. You can flip the face, and set it for two time zones.
It's your move, Miles.
Except for two years when he was in the Navy, in Korea.
So who'd you hire?
No.
You like kids.
Why do you think she did it?
Maybe she wanted a free trip to LA. Maybe they offered her money. Massey is very seductive. Who knows.
Do you have a hard heart, Marylin.
Why would you be here?
As a matter of fact, I'm a huge fan.
That is true, isn't it Miles? Your pre-nup is the best there is?
Howard is a beautiful person.
More pictures? My God, Marylin. You can open an erotic art gallery.
No. Just to comfort you, and appreciate you --
You're right about me. I am worthless. I am nothing. I don't deserve to live.
And your mother was very beautiful. She must be proud of you.
She didn't love you?
I'm sorry Miles. You shouldn't listen to me. I'm sure you have a very fulfilling life. I'd better go. I'm depressing.
I want to be your -- your wife.
Here's my card. Spend as much as you want. We get mileage.
Exactly. And then -- maybe -- not right away -- There's a room right off the bedroom -- It would be perfect for a nursery.  It's a walk in humidor right now -- but if I took out the refrigeration unit --
Comfy!
I want to nail you ass.
Salary. Unreported income.  By the way, what time IS it on Bellagio Road?
You can't prove anything.
Drop the bogus forgery charge and I'll forget about your generous friends slash clients.
Hello?
Marylin?
No buts. Now. Out.
Please! Leave the house.
Marylin. Run. I'll distract him.
Rex. Get away from the door.
Marylin.
What?
-- is not a challenge. I need something I can sink my teeth into, professionally speaking.
Please! No calls! I'm feeling very fragile.
Marylin Rexroth? When does she --
Sam is Sam. He's taking up fly fishing. He's in a yert in Montana.
What?!
My client is prepared to entertain an amicable dissolution of the marriage without prejudice.
Why not a hundred and fifty percent?
...The fault, dear Brutus, is not in our stars...
Mm.
The fault, dear Brutus, is not in our stars, but in ourselves. Well, let me ask you this: what kind of settlement do you seek? What are, for you, the parameters of the possible?
So, you propose that in spite of demonstrable infidelity on your part, your unoffending wife should be tossed out on her ear?
I tried to reach Ruth, but we couldn't get her.
And how would you define your relationship to Mrs. Rexroth. You know -- you are her...?
No. I haven't. But I've been out of town.  Hello, Rex. Hello there.
No. He's been trailed twenty-four hours a day since this thing started. He can't even get a phone call we don't know about.
Oh, no, sir. No different than
Who said anything about a reward!
We'll go into that some other time.
You were taken for a buggy ride?
That's an evasion.
If Gandhi had a chef like Paul, it would change the whole political situation in India.
I won't thank you! I'll never thank you!
No.
He doesn't think so much of you either.
Fine man to fall in love with.
It's no use, Dad. I practically threw myself at him. 
Been sending her meals in regularly?
What would you like to have me do?
Oh, no. She'll be crazy about it. Well, see you later. I'm going out on the lawn and arrange for landing space.  Goodbye. 
Here's another wire, sir. This one's from Charleston.  "Checking every northbound train. Also assigned twenty operatives to watch main highways. No success yet. Will continue to do everything possible." Signed: Lovington Detective Agency, Charleston.
Any others?
Don't want to talk todon't want to talk to anybody. Don't want to see anybody.
But it's King Westley on the phone.
Ooooooh.  Hello my would-be ex-son-in-law. I've sent you a check for a hundred thousand. Yes. That's the smartest thing you ever did, Westley, not to contest that annulment. That's satisfactory, isn't it? Yeah. Well, it ought to be. Oh I'm not complaining. It was dirt cheap.  Don't fall out of any windows.
No.
What do you think you're doing!
Oh, yeah?
Oh, my heavens! It's gone!
What am I going to do now?
Don't be a fool. You lost your bag. The company'll make good. What's your name?
See here, can you understand English! I don't want it reported!  Please stay out of my affairs!  I want to be left alone.  A CLOSE-UP of PETER shows him glaring after her.
That was foolish of me. Why didn't you shove me away?
What are you talking about?
Listen, if you'll promise not to do it, I'll pay you. I'll pay you as much as he will. You won't gain anything by giving me away as long as I'm willing to make it worth your while. I've got to get to New York without being stopped. It's terribly important to me. I'd pay now, only the only thing I had when I jumped off the yacht was my wrist watch and I had to pawn that to get these clothes. I'll give you my address and you can get in touch with me the minute you get to New York.
Oh, I forgot to tell you. I registered as Mr. and Mrs. 
This?  Oh, that's a matter of simple mathematics. These cabins cost two bucks a night and I'm very sorry to inform you, wifey dear, but the family purse won't stand for our having separate establishments. 
That, I suppose, makes everythinguhquite all right.
You've got a name, haven't you?
High time you got back.
Very outspoken, too. Said I looked funny. Wasn't that cute?
I thought maybeuh"believe you me" told you a couple of snappy stories.
Yeah?
One consolation; you can never be lonesome.
Oh. Is that how you met him?
That's Father at work, What'll I do?  Peter, what'll I do?
There you go again! How many times did I tell you to stop butting in when I have an argument?
You don't have to lose your temper!  That's what you told me the last time too. Every time I step in to protect you. At the Elk's dance[7] when that big Swede made a pass at you
I was never built for these moonlight strolls.  Why did we have to leave the bus?
Not a sou. I had some before the fainting scene.
Never! I'll get to New York if I have to starve all the way.
Must be some strange power Westley has over you women.  How do you expect to get there?
knowbut
What?
Uh-huh. Want one?
You don't think I'm going around panhandling for you.  Best thing in the world for youcarrots. Had a tough time getting them. If that farmer ever caught megoodnight!
Oh, they'll stop, all right. It's a matter of knowing how to hail them.
There's no end to your accomplishments.
You figured that all out yourself, huh?
Here comes a car!
Come on! come on! 
That's swell!
Same to you.
Why don't you stay and watch the fun? You'll enjoy it immensely.
No, it isn't. I'm hungry andand scared.
Eight o'clock! Why, that's twelve hours!
Oh, thank you. Thank you.
In about fifteen minutes.
Isn't he here?
Why, you can't put me out in the middle of the
Serves you right. Oughta be careful who you take up with on the road. You can't go plyin' your trade in my camp.
That's it. Dyke's Auto Camp.
Here's another wire from Peter Warne.
Collect?
Joe, listen
Don't "Joe" me.
What!
Huh?
You're drunk.
Looks like we're going to be stuck for a long time. 
Huh?
Yeah. Just babies.
Boss, Oswald impersonators?  Sounds like James Bond now.
If this is Oswald, it must be our third Oswald.
Susie, watch the language, would you please.
There you go.  Grain of salt.  Two sides to every coin.
Yeah, she was pretty, all right, but not half as cute as you, Deano.  You shoulda tried a legitimate line of business.
Mario, Jose - they wear names like you and I wear clothes.  Today the name is Candy, tomorrow it's Butsie. I wish I could help you, Jim.
Well, the kid musta gone nuts, right?  I said Oswald must've flipped.  Just did this crazy thing before anyone could stop him, right?
Your boss got a serious problem, Bill.  Real serious.  We know what's been going on at your office
Frank, I don't want to hear it.
He'll never sign a statement, boss, let alone get on a witness stand.
When something's rotten in the land, Bill, it generally isn't just one fish, we'll get corroboration... find this Clay Bertrand.  If I were a betting man, I'd give you 10 to 1 it's an alias.  Start checking around the Quarter.
I don't buy it, chief - why would the FBI cover it up?  You're talking the whole FBI here.  A telex that disappears from every single FBI office in the country?
So for those reasons, you're going to trial against Clay Shaw, chief? Well, you're gonna lose!  We should be investigating all our Mafia leads here in New Orleans - Carlos Marcello, Santos Trafficante - I can buy that a hell of a lot easier than the Government.  Ruby's all Mob, knows Oswald, sets him up.  Hoffa - Trafficante - Marcello, they hire some guns and they do Kennedy and maybe the Government doesn't want to open up a whole can o'worms there because it used the Mob to get to Castro.  Y'know, Castro being assassinated sounds pretty wild to John Q.  Citizen.  So they close the book on J.F.K.  It makes sense to me.
I know this, Bill - Lyndon Johnson got $1 billion for his Texas friends, Brown and Root, to dredge Cam Ranh Bay for the military in Vietnam. That's just for openers.
Nick, what would happen if a man suffering from hypertension were to take an entire bottle of Proloid?
No, I did not.
Dave, you know that's where this road leads.
What do you mean?
Who was paying you, Dave?
Black, black - just give it to me.  Shit.  I'm so exhausted.  My neck is killing me.  I've got cancer.  Had it for years.  I been working with mice, y'know, trying to come up with a cure.
I don't remember his name.  You must understand it was quite crowded, and when you are called in circumstances like that to look at the wound of the President who is dead, you don't look around too much to ask people for their names and who they are.
That doesn't make sense, Mrs. Hill. We have the man that killed the President.
I want the truth.
No, I saw a guy shooting from over there.  He was behind that fence. What are you going to do about it?
Finally they shuttle him to a radio factory in Minks where he lives as high on the hog as he ever has - he's given 5,000 rubles, a roomy apartment with a balcony, has affairs with local girls.
Don't get sidetracked!  How does he get back to the States?  That's the point.  Does he have any problems?
None!  The State Department issues him a new passport in 48 hours and loans him the money to travel.  He's never investigated or charged by the Navy for revealing classified information or, as far as we know, debriefed by the CIA.
The FBI finally gets around to talking to him in Dallas and runs a file on him as a miscreant Communist type.
I wouldn't imagine where.
Let me show you his picture. 
You really have me consorting with a cast of sordid characters, don't you, Mr. Garrison.
It says that this company has heavily Fascist ties to the French secret army organization that tried to assassinate de Gaulle in 1960.
...and that this company is linked to the Schlumber tool company here in Houma, Louisiana - which is where their arms may have come from to David Ferrie and his Cubans...
I can't believe a man as intelligent as Earl Warren ever read what's in those volumes.
I cannot believe this.  It's four- thirty, Jim Garrison.  I have five children are gonna be awake in another hour and ...
My sympathies.
Did they live?
How do you know?  How do you even know what goes on in this house anymore!  You're too busy making speeches, stirring up every crazed Klansman in Louisiana after us!
Anything else unusual about him you'd be able to describe in a court of law, Willie?
Oh no!... How bad?
One little guy with a cheap rifle - look what he can do.
I'd say he was probably getting intelligence training.
Bill, Lou, we're standing in the heart of the United States Government's intelligence community in New Orleans.  That's the FBI there, the CIA, Secret Service, ONI.  Doesn't this seem to you a rather strange place for a Communist to spend his spare time?
Beats me.  City officials.  Secret Service.  Dallas police.  They did a dry run with Chief Curry a few days before.  But they didn't bother running through Dealey.  They stopped right there, said something like, "and afterwards there's only the freeway," and went home.
His boss was the one on the Warren Commission who handled all the leads to the intelligence community.
Well, if that's what you want to call it.  I didn't ever think it would come to this.  I guess I am, boss.
Sad thing is the way it's screwing up this country, all these hippies running around on drugs, the way young people look you can't tell a boy from a girl anymore.  I saw a girl the other day, she was pregnant - you could see her whole belly, and you know what she painted on it? "Love Child."  It's fuckin' outa control.  Values've gone to hell, Jim... Course it figures when you got somebody like that polecat Johnson in the White House.
Russell, honestly you sound like one of those kooky critics spreading paranoia like prairie fire.  I just can't believe the Chief Justice of the United States would put his name on something that wasn't true.
Are they?  Why would they?
You didn't get that break you needed, but you went as far as any man could, bubba.  What can I do for you?
Any chance of one of them confessing someday?
It never did. 
Just think... just think.  What happened to our country .. to the world...  because of that murder... Vietnam, racial conflict, breakdown of law, drugs, thought control, guilt, assassinations, secret government fear of the frontier...
Hate mail here.  Fan mail here.  The bad news is the IRS has just requested an audit on your income from this office.
Germany.
Less than you would guess.  Most days two to three assistant D.A.'s. A handful of police investigators.
And what would I have to do?
Yes.
Then do you understand that I cannot tell the truth here?  In Dallas. That there are people here who do not want me to tell the truth... who do not want me to have a retrial?
No, that could not be done, Mr. Ruby. There are a good many things involved in that.
This looks pretty good on me.
Tomorrow I'll talk to your probation officer. Karen's a good kid, but she's mad at you, because you lied to her. This business about your grandmother's funeral
So you're gonna call Karen tomorrow?
Who?
I'm still scared as a motherfucker, Ordell. They talkin' like they serious 'bout me doin' that machine gun time.
Why were you with him?
She almost sounds scared.
I doubt it.  Who's your friend?
This is your money?
Oh, I wouldn't be so sure. What with all the cash, I think I could go with Conspiracy to Traffic.
Take your time.
I thought you might want a drink?
It's kind of a sports bar
That doesn't sound dark.
Was she helpful?
The federal agent kinda half hinted Ordell might of done Beaumont.
You mentioned a guy from L.A.P.D., but you didn't mention the Federal.
No, you didn't. What branch?
Thanks, but I have my own now.
Uh-huh.
I'm fine with it, or I wouldn't of done it, I did it to feel better about myself, and I do. When I look in the mirror it looks like me.
Bigger?
"American President"
Bring the money in and they follow it?
He always just picked it up at my place. But with A.T.F. involved, I want to stage it. You know, make it look more intriguing, like we know what the fuck we're doin'. Then it's up to Ray Nicolet, the A.T.F. guy to follow the shopping bag.
Maybe. But I'm thinking it might be something like he wants the money for himself.
Not really. But I knew this narcotics cop one time. Told me that in a raid, the whole package never gets back to the station. His exact words.
What? If I was in Nicolet's place?
If I saw a way to walk off with a shopping bag full of money, would I take it?
Hi, I'm Max Cherry. Your bail bondsman.
I told them Ordell's changed the amount he's bringing in.
Do you think they bought it?
Less ten percent.
Yes'm.
You know what's in the bag you're taking?
We can look into that.
Then how do you know he sells guns?
This is A.T.F. agent Ray Nicolet, Jackie Brown, Ordell Robbie money exchange trial run. It's three p.m., July 4th 1997. The location is the parking structure at LAX.
You talk to him?
White girl named Melanie Ralston. Another girlfriend of Ordell's.
I was told ten thousand in each pack.
Do you think I took some of that money?
Buy ya a beer?
Uh-uh.
Hi, Melanie.
Got some o.j.?
Now, baby, that's got nothin' to do with you. I just carry that. You been listenin' to them cops too much.
I understand woman, damn!
I got a problem...
The Cockatoo Inn? Where's that?
It's right on Hawthorne Boulevard and Manhattan Beach Boulevard. It's red brick...
Naw, naw, that's too much exposure. I ain't goin anywhere near that money.
No, I give it to someone else first.
That's an agent. Manager's get fifteen percent.
Who?
Are you sure she don't know about the money?
Designer clothes.
Where you gonna be during all this?
Who's paging you?
That works on my nerves, you bein' so buddy-buddy with him.
He thinks he's Joe Gunn now.
Where at?
Bank robbery.
It's like this major meal in a shake you drink instead of having a big meal.
It's a diet thing?
Which one?
Yeah.
Detroit.
He killed a man worked for him the other night.
That's not what I'm saying at all.  You know where he went?
Please.
Let him and that stewardess get that money over here...
Is it this aisle, Lou-is?
You ain't got to do nothing. Just point at it and push the button. You'll hear the car go "bleep." That means the alarm's off and the doors are open.
Guess where I am?
What did he do?
What's your relationship?
She tryin' to work your ass against me, ain't she?
You didn't even hafta say it. I know the woman.
I got it. Listen, there's something else I have to tell you.
When I see you. Pick me up at Sam's. You count the money?
The fitting room. It went down exactly the way it was supposed to.
How long was she in there?
Okay, so it was Jackie Brown.
Cops can't locate him, huh?
C'mon, you know how they do. Black man comes in with ten thousand, they wanna fuck with 'em. First off, they gonna wanna know where I got it. Second, they gonna keep a big chunk of it -- start talkin' that court cost shit. Fuck that shit, Jack. I'll go through you.
What's his full name?
They do consider this a violation of his probation. Your boy's looking at ten years, plus the concealed weapon.
House.
She is an airline stewardess. Got caught coming back from Mexico with some blow. They set her bond this afternoon at ten thousand. Now, what I was thinkin', you could use the ten thousand you owe me from Beaumont and move it over on to the stewardess.
Somebody already did.
Hear what?
What does she do for you?
Jackie ain't got time for all that shit --
I'm telling you what I have to do. What you have to do, in case you forgot, is come up with premium of a thousand bucks.
Well, come back when you do, and I'll bond out the stewardess.
If I don't see it in front of me, you're right. It ain't shit.
Falsely accused? She didn't come back from Mexico with cocaine on her?
Where is it?
You know who this is?
The bond collateral on Beaumont Livingston you moved over to cover Miss Brown, remember?
Winston found you.
This place stinks.
She's been there since Thursday night.
She wanted to see me, why wasn't she home?
That's why she's givin' up my money huh? Not that bullshit about Melanie. I didn't trust her ass neither, but I knew how to handle her. She was my blonde-headed little surfer gal. I fuckin' told Louis he could've just given her a punch in the mouth, he didn't need to shoot her. She's at your office.
Now, is there anything you want to tell me before we get out of this car?
Hey, hey, hey. I think somebody's got some new clothes.
He leave town?
Dead? No. I just hurt my back. I'm not dead.
Della?
I'm okay.
Do you want some help? I can call upstairs.
Daddy. Let go.
Listen, I just got a strange call from Geary. He said the guys backed down. What's he talking about?
Things happen? What the fuck are you talking about? They did something to us, Frank. We have to expose this.
Shit! You know it's not half the case if I go it alone. We're all suffering the same symptoms, Frank. The army is to blame. They've done something to us. How can you not want to know?
What the hell? What kind of mumbo jumbo ... ?
Gabe?  What are you doing ... ?
Don't go.
War games? Thailand? That's not true! How can you believe that? Can't you see what they're doing? It's all a lie. We were in Da Nang, for God's sake. You've got to believe me.
What did she have to say?
Turn on your right side.  How about the other "right?"  I don't understand you philosphers. You've got the whole world figured out but you can't remember the difference between right and left.
Loves me!? She hasn't said a kind word about me in years!
What? She threw me out, remember. She wanted some professor to carry her far away from Brooklyn. Only we didn't make it. She can't forgive me that she still lives in the same house she grew up in.
God almighty. What did you do to me?
What?
Louis, you're a life saver.
Jake, you need to rest.
Oh, you'd be surprised. They just don't have their doctorates, that's all.
I know very little about demons, Ja- cob, fleshy ones anyway. I know them as literary figures, biblical ones ... Dante, Milton ... but Jacob,  this is the 20th Century. We don't see demons now.
I'd like to speak to Dr. Carlson, please.
You want me to spell it out? There's nothing here.
I'm not cold.
What a dream I was having. I was living with another woman ... You know who it was?
Guilty thoughts. See what happens when you cheat on me, even in your mind?
I'm not dead. I am not dead.
Who did?
What do you mean?
Your kid dropped it off.
And where do you think Jezebel comes from?
A good lay.
What's in here?
Not to me.
Jake!
Jake.  You're gonna be all right, Jake. You're gonna be fine.
I don't believe this.
Where were you, Jake? Where've you been? Why haven't you called?
I have no idea.  I was right. There were experiments. I knew it. I knew it. My God.
It's amazing, you know, that a drug could change things like that, destroy a life and then give it back. It's hard to believe that the world could be so hellish on day and like heaven the next.
I tell you, it was so wonderful. I felt like a little boy. I saw Paradise, Jezzie.
It's not practical, Jez. It'll be hard enough alone.
Reasonable? Reasonable? Jake ... You're gettin' me angry.
Sit down.
So tell me ... am I still an angel?
It's going to be all right, Jake. It's going to be all right. Don't be afraid. I've got you now.
Cause you know goddamn well who I am.
You look terrible. What happened?  Jake ... is it the antidote?
Shit! Can't I just have a bad day?
West.
Do what? I haven't done a thing.
Where have they gone?
This isn't happening.
Like it was yesterday.
The truth can kill, my friend. Five hundred men died out there. This isn't a story they'd ever want out. When Paul's car blew up I realized the scope of the thing. I knew they meant business.
Throw that torch away, young man. Give yourself up. You're under arrest.
Jacob Singer?
Me neither. Nothing too exciting. So tell me, to what do I owe the honor?
It's almost like a conspiracy, huh?
You and everybody else. God I hate this area. Makes me nervous.
Last month, before Thanksgiving.
I have some ice from the machine.
Okay, enough of this shit.
When the left hull goes, so will the right.
Blowing the walkway? You come up with that yourself?
Where the hell were you?!!
Creepy.
Everyone okay?
Hurry!
My god! This is way over your head, pal. We need to call some experts and . . .
I am an expert!
My job.
Got it! Let's move out girls. Yllo go to Lab two and cover out backs.
You sumbitch! Three dead! On my watch! If that...that thing is out there, it's dead! You got it!!!
Don't just stand there! Shoot him!
See? We're not so bad.
Oh great...yeah, having a great time, and you?
God damnit! Will you stop doing that?!
I'll help you in.
Now this is getting exciting.
YeaH, GREAT IDEA! And I'll keep the big guy distracted with a blow job.
No.
Any connection between your reality and mine is purely coincidental.
I'm surrounded by idiots.
No...  That's the sound of the men working on the chain gang.
Ow!
Sorry, sorry.
Yes, I've reprogrammed you. You are very brave. Bad ass.
I am now. I missed you, Thorgan.
How do you know?
The power's back up!
Impossible! He was dead before he entered Cryo-statis. There is no possible way he could be alive.
So, you're saying thse guys have like, lasers and stuff? They could hack him to pieces?
Do me this favor just once. Use the ponds.
Just a favor for your old man.
My cars. And a comic book.
You got it.
Sexy, hm? What was I before?
Michael! Come inside!
Martin!  Are you going to shut down the beach on your own authority?
I don't think you can appreciate the gut reaction people have to these things.
...height and weight may only be estimated from partial remains. Torso severed in mid-thorax, eviscerated with no major organs remaining. May I have a drink of water? Right arm severed above the elbow with massive tissue loss from upper musculature. Portions of denuded bone remaining.  -- did you notify the coast guard?
We will. There's something I've got to find out.
You're situation here suggests that a Great White has staked out a claim in the waters around Amity Island, and that he will continue to feed here as long as there is food in the water.
I hope we get some more help.
What's that, a ship?
I didn't know her.
You wanna call it a night after here?
You do this all the time, right, Charlie?
Like those Cousteau specials on television? I think it's for the kids, but I love them.
I've got all these signs here...
Transplants?
-- and an America's Cup Trials...
What do you see?
Bull shark scraped me while I was taking samples...
He's heading under -- !
You ran eight miles today, Puppy.
My mom uses color-safe bleach.
I thought I might, you know, nip it in the bud before it gets worse. Because I heard in health class that pregnancy often results in an infant.
Hey Juno... A couple of us are going to the cineplex after school to donut that movie with the guy with eighteen kids.
Sorry, Bleek... Going for my ultrasound. Gotta note and everything.
Okay, cool.
That's not how our thing works! I hurl the accusations and you talk me down, remember?
Like I'd marry you! You would be the meanest wife of all time. And anyway, I know you weren't bored that day because there was a lot of stuff on TV. The Blair Witch Project was on Starz, and you were like, "Oh, I want to watch this, but we should make out instead. La la la."
I still have your virginity!
No...
Huh?
You shouldn't be carrying that heavy bag. I'll take it.
Yeah. That was me.
I try really hard, actually...
I was just bored. I only think school is awesome like, 80% of the time.
What are you talking about?
I think kids get bored and have intercourse. And I think Junebug was a dummy about it. But we have to move on from here and help her figure it out.
Did you see it coming when she sat us down here?
Oh God yeah. But I was hoping she was expelled or into hard drugs.
They said they wanted to know about this stuff. They said to keep them updated, so I did!
Ow, ow, fuckity-ow. Bren, when do I get that Spinal Tap thing?
No Josh, I don't take orders. Not from you and not from any man.
What? My eyes are not lying!
Fine. Call me when you learn how to love just one person and not cheat at your brother's college just because you had four Smirnoff Ices and a bottle of Snow Peak Peach flavored Boone's!
Why aren't you at work?
Like what?
Yeah?
Don't you remember you told me you loved me, baby...
Why? What the big deal?
I doubt anyone's throwing us a shower.
I'm dying to see what you've got to teach me.
I... How do you think of me, Juno? Why are you here?
I heard that was you.
Well hi Vanessa! What brings you to the mall today?
Oh my God -- It moved! I felt it!
You should have seen this octopus furnace. I had to get out my Hazmat suit just to get up in there...
Do you need a large sum of money? Legal counsel?
What?
Well, it's kind of skanky. Isn't that what you girls call it? Skanky? Skeevy?
Tore up from the floor up?
How did you even generate enough pee for three pregnancy tests?
I'm staying pregnant, Le.
What did you have in mind, a family of disturbed loners who are into gunplay and incest?
You sound shocked or something.
Keith's hot.
Katrina? Pfft, no way. He doesn't like Katrina. It must be a pity date.
I wouldn't be so sure about that. He did it with you. He's a man now.
Obviously, we'll compensate you for your medical expenses.
I've been just wondering if we're, you know, ready.
Of course we're ready. We've taken all the classes. The nursery. The books --
You lose!
...Hey you're good. Thought you said you never played before?
I'm cool.
That's me.
Yeah, and in California you never have to buy fruit 'cause it's all on the trees everywhere you turn...  ...and, 'course there ain't no speed limit out there, and all drugs are legal... And I heard your first month's rent is free; state law. I figure 'til we get settled we can just move around month to month...
Can you believe thirty bucks for this room... for what? A lumpy mattress, that crummy TV and a crapper.
Well, it's like this, Mr. Kessler.
This guy killed a mess of people.
Yeah.
Sure.
Wait a minute. You're gonna hustle me?
...and?
You two been busy in here.
No we can't. We can never leave once you start talking about tenure... and vacation pay... and parking privileges and... oh shit! let's just go to California now, right now, before it's too late.
Carrie, watch for Early.
...Apprehensive. Let's not forget these are the people who banned the Mapplethorpe show. Anyway, California's loaded with galleries.
Bri'.
...never?
Darlin' you were 'bout that far from spendin' the night at the morgue. You understand?
Well it took me longer than I thought it would take. It took like 15 minutes to talk her into it. But once it was on, we fucked for a good half an hour. I had to keep taking it out and putting it back in. It hurts the first time.
I can tell that she had just entered puberty.
Yeah.
What do you mean?
That would be good. But I mean more like. I don't know. Like when I was having sex with her, I kept thinking how much I would like to put it in her ass. Just to see what would happen.
Are you hungry?
Telly.
You got any money?
You down with the boost?
Yeah, that would be fun but I don't like any of the girls you go out with. Like that one girl with two teeth and a clit ring.
I wanna fuck Darcy.
Darcy?
That's just it. It's elitist. It's reverse elitism. Because you give money to whoever is the most fucked up. I notice what you do.
Man, Telly, your little brother is getting big.
Yo, you got any weed around here?
Hey Jennie. Long time no see. What are you doing here?
I don't know. But all I know is that I kicked him so many times my fuckin' toe feels broken.
Man we fucked him up.
Yeah, watch where you walk dukes.
Yeah. Come on.
You have?
No. I can't. My mom won't let me have boyfriends.
I don't know. I guess it's cause my sister Nicki had a baby when she was like 15. She was really young so my mom is like very protective over me.
You should come back with me to Steven's house.
I don't know. I'm supposed to go to Nasa tonight.
I like you so much. I think you're beautiful. I think if we fucked you would love it. You wouldn't believe it.
Fine Fidget. What's all this?
Come dance.
Have you ever had anal intercourse?
No, not everything? The sun is still shinning. It's a beautiful day out. Some things are OK. Right?
No.
Now that's it. A smile. You look like a prom queen when you smile. Like a glamour girl.
Yeah?
You still mad at him?
I know.
Mine?
Yeah. And you're not getting anything out of it.
Shh. Come on, it's gonna be OK.
I don't know. Just some messy little scrap. You know that bullshit.
Who, Benny's little sister?
Uh, let's see here, would you happen to have diss digg?
Me. I can only take it up to fifteen minutes. Cause I get bored.
And I know that one of them fucked like two other girls, who were both virgins, so I knew he was safe.
Not too late.
It's me. Telly.
What kind of problem?
No.
The message!  I figured out--
Local?
Take it easy.  Both of you.
No shit!
You should be an actor, Frank.  You looked like you were really mad.  The veins popping out on your neck was a really nice touch.
It isn't him.  Frank, you brought me in on this in the beginning because you wanted my opinion if he was capable of doing this.
We'll find the evidence.
Hello, Peter.
Very amateurish, Peter.  I'm surprised you would use such an obvious tactic.  I'm not an idiot!  Don't treat me as one!  I'll call you everyday... You get one minute, whether you put me on hold or talk is up to you!  Are you ready to play?
Huxley's quote also says, "his play is always fair and just."
Have you any idea what the message is?
If it's so important, why don't you just tell me?
Congratulations on your daring escape. You just missed me by a few seconds.  It's check, Peter.
What's this?
Can we correlate data?  Look for specific things, like player's ages... stuff like that?
Nope.  Nothing.
Never mind.  He died two years ago.
He was watching you.
Yeah -- that's what we've always thought -- but what if he wasn't?  What if I had nothing to do with the reason he came here?
I can't sleep.  My beds lumpy.
I see.  You forgot to bring you're night-light, didn't you?
You ready?
Whaddaya got, Nolan?
You mean, no prints but hers?
I'd say at least eighteen hours.
Kathy?
Before we go in I gotta tell you this isn't going to be pretty.
He's right, Kathy.
We can't rely on your judgement anymore.
Did you see his face?
This is a printout from the hotel computer for all the messages logged to your room.  Here's one at 9:04 pm.  It says:  From Debi.  Please call me at home.
Why didn't you tell us you were there earlier?
"Wee Willie Winkie runs though the street."  We think he might be making a reference to himself.
I understand that this is just another one of your games.
On a variation, yes -- but it must be a variation that is unique.
Because I love them, but they drive me crazy.  You know how parents are?
It is.
I can't right now.  I've got a game.
In a way.
What about you?  Aren't there times when a young child is telling you a story so sad you just want to cry?
Relax.
How the hell can I relax after seeing what I just saw.
No.  But I'm open to distractions.
You know, you're not the easiest person in the world to get close to.
Would you settle for pepperoni?
Peter, you have to admit--
What?
Peter...
It's not that easy.
Of course it isn't.  It's always difficult when someone you love dies. But you can't feel responsible because she had a car accident.
I'm sure you are.
No, I want you to do good.  That way when I beat you at the end I'll look that much better.
If you're going to marry a warrior, you'd best get used to it.
I don't have to look around. I've found the husband I want. You can kiss me now.
I lied.
About what?
Lyssa ... Lyssa ...
Lyssa ...
They have Lyssa!
I must follow the Slayers. They've taken Lyssa.
This is not the first time the Dark Ones have attacked our world. They came once before, a thousand years ago. A young king and queen, with extraordinary powers, were given to us then, to lead the struggle. My fore-father was their Councilor, as I will be yours.
I have no extraordinary powers.
Two or three days! While Lyssa is in their hands?
There is no other way.
You have rope?
No. Then they were led by his underlings. But I knew he had come this time, from the ferocity of their onslaught, from their use of The Fortress. They use up much of their strength to do these things. They are taking great risks.
Like you, she has extraordinary powers. He would make her his Queen.
No. She must agree of her own free will.
What use is my sword? I can't reach her!
What business?
How did you know I had sons?
Subject to the King, no doubt.
A good thrust, my friend. Another second and there'd have been nothing between my head and shoulders but bad memories.
Would you settle for a boar?
Me.  May I eat with you tonight?
A small house.
No.
I'm hungry.
The greatest boon of your otherwise worthless life, blockhead, is the privilege of dining on boar roasted by the hand of Ergo the Magnificent.
Look at its beauty. Look at its grace.
For some, the lure of power is stronger than the ties of blood. No matter. I had hoped to have the wedding next spring, Lord Turold, with all the nobles of the kingdom in attendance. But Fate and this war have ordained otherwise.
I will tell you something you did not know, Turold. Had it been my choice, all those years ago, I would have chosen you for my king. But my parents chose otherwise.
You knew! You are a rude bumpkin!
Modred! Impossible!
We seek the Fortress of Krull.
Such a vision will be opposed. Who seeks it?
It is fifty years since I spoke it to you.
It will not help.
He forgot his money...  My mother's got a pub, behind the corner, and he forgot his money, about 100$.
Give me his name, I will mail him.
Yeah, pal! And I didn't say anything, I said I don't know you.  But do you know what did she say, that stupid Raphaella?
...What?
...You can leave whenever you want. I don't refrain you.
Not taken.
It's cool departing this way... warm... music...
...I'd like knowing what he's listening to...
...I don't know.
Nothing, for the moment.
Why did you unleash the pipe, I don't know?
Yes?
Excuse me, Mister... I'm looking for Mister Rubens' apartment, but it's dark out here and I got lost...
Huh?
Huh? Why?
Can I sit on the stairways now?
But... He works for your same employer?
Huh? Are you Alfredo's son, then?
Where?
What is it?
Uncle Maurice -- I spent all our frequent flyer miles on a one way ticket here... I have a rented car outside, just listen to me.  Come back with me now, and if you still want to do something like this in a year -- maybe we'll plan a car trip across the country -- Gerald and I will come along --
If you really want to do this... plan it out.  Rest up.  Train for it.  Build up your body.  Plan every stop along the way.  How much money?  Time?  Really do it properly.  This is all so -- by the seat of your pants.
I've all ready gone six hundred miles... I can't do it again.
Then it'll have to wait until I finish.
I have to finish first.
We're very sorry about that.  Some of our men were on the scene of the accident.
How long does this... Mania last?
What are the odds?  Do I have a fifty-fifty chance of surviving the operation?
I mean why the sudden voluntary visit  -- usually it takes gun- point to get you in here...
Yes -- you are.
I've seen it before.
I don't know -- maybe twenty miles... Of course I'm not recommending that... if someone like you had to I mean... that's how far they'd probably get before encountering serious physical walls.
Honey, I told you.  If it makes you happy, we should just do it.
Sometimes people need to see things done for them -- because sooner or later they don't believe the words anymore.
A Book Society Award is a very prestigious thing.
Please not, 'The two kinds of people' speech.
It must've hit the window... I think its neck is broken.
Why there?
I don't want my wife's soul having any doubts.
Not our problem.
Shit!  He jumped!
Your parents would want you to be in bed.
Okay nine.  Big Billy's team was losing and he was on base.  That's when Isaac came up.  He could barely hold the bat... Big Billy winked at Isaac... The ball was pitched -- Isaac hit the ball hard. It soared up and out over the stadium.  Everyone cheered.  Isaac hit a home run and won the game. After the game, Isaac asked Big Billy why he let he play.  Big Billy smiled and said, I wasn't always Big Billy, I was Little Billy first... Isaac and Big Billy went off after the game and read a classic book together.  The end.
Don't worry baby, it shouldn't take you more than five days if you just stop to sleep and eat.
What are you saying?  This story is too big for this paper?
This is a ghost town.  Nothing ever happens.
When are you leaving?
Phileas Fogg?
She knew you loved her.
I'm really lost.  What does this have to do with walking?
Pacifica, California... that's a long ways away.
Come on Mr. Parker.
You ever lose somebody Stephanie?
Hello.
No alcohol?
...Noooo.
No.
Oh... well, maybe we better synchronize our spells... or stagger them.
No, I came here to drink... myself... you know...
Sera... you know I'm not much good in the sack.
Three nights, two days. When is your rent coming up at the motel?
Sera...
Don't you think you'll get a little bored living with a drunk?
Sera... what you don't understand is...
How are you doing?
What was that all about?
I don't understand any of that.
Yes... I'll give you that.
Please don't raise your voice. I won't bother you about it again.
Don't hit me.
You understand you're on trial for murder?
What?
He thinks I'm guilty, doesn't he?
I'm glad it's you and not Donovan.
Did she have a weapon in her hand?
Okay -- Ms. Windham, when you uh arrived back at the house? Was your father there?
Yes, Your Honor. Had you ever gotten a perm before, Miss Windham?
Dewey Newcomb?
Due to the fact that you retained the residence, Ms. Bonafante is entitled to full ownership of the canine property in question and we will be enforcing said ownership immediately.
All I know is -- it's not Brooke.
Thank you.
I think it's time discuss your career path. Have you thought about where you might be a summer associate?
For what? Breaking my heart or ruining sex for me with any other man?
Uh -- both?
Could I be anymore goddamn spastic?  So you're sure, this Warner guy is "the one"?
I feel so bad for her. I mean, she's in jail! And she's innocent. But I'm the only one who believes her. Donovan totally thinks she's guilty.
So, this is the only interaction you two have ever had?
Too bad you and I are the only ones.
I think you should go with red. It's the color of confidence.
No, but she made me cry once. Not in class -- I waited until I got to my room, but yeah, she can pretty much shrivel your balls -- or you know, your whatevers.
Don't ask.
Uh, for starters, she won't give us an alibi --
She's completely untrustworthy.
Why?
But maybe it's not what you think.
Damn. We can't see her for an hour?
I can't.
I don't --  Do that stuff.
Whoa -- Why?
Someone missed you.
How could this happen?
Girls -- I'm going to Harvard!
I miss you guys! The people here are so vile! Hardly anyone even talks to me unless it's to say something that's not nice. Law school sucks!
I wish we could stay longer, but I have a game.
Why not?
I did?
My family expects a lot from me. And I expect a lot from me. I plan on running for office some day.
Tell me about it. I can't imagine doing all this and Donovan's internship next year.
In court. On opposing sides.
And what is your boyfriend's name?
More fun win battle?
My generosity is not so large as that.
You are cruel!  Your heartless jesting worse than torture!  How can you speak of love when you see what I am!
Not from me, surely...
I know no more of shame than I do of fear.  I wear this mask not for concealment but protection.
Like some vile toadstool.
Why have you brought me here?
Yes?
I see...
Do as you wish with my body, you'll never possess my soul!
Might we watch, too?
Now I want to live forever.  I've never felt so strong or happy.
Yes.  I feel that, too.  Weakness is what is ugly.
You don't ravage the countryside, devouring maidens and burning the crops?
Flozen foleva not good.
And if I cannot?
Generally known!  What general ever knew more than to lace up his boots?
Don't you know?
Lamentable news, Jack... but tis the fate of the living concerns us now.
Did you hear?  Twas the killing of the unicorn caused it.
Tricks, is it?  Why I'll trick ye! Ungrateful whelp!  I'll sour your milk and bird droppings'll fall from the sky wherever ye walk.
Fine-looking army.
Aye.  Said to follow it to the edge of night.  But is this the right bird?
Birds speak to me all the time. What did it say?
Foul fellow, this Couer de Noir.
Your imagination runs away with you, Jack... Those bones be but battlefield gleanings, like I mentioned.  A wee bit of carrion to frighten off the uninvited.
My God!  Look!
We're not in a tournament, Gump.  Ah, but a sword twice tempered in the blood of living dragons...
We're blind now.  Oona was our eyes and ears.  How do we find the Castle Couer de Noir without her?
There isn't much time!
Been telling you that all along, lad.
Nay, lad, we're here to collect a weapon you'll need fighting the Baron.
A good day for singing...
Not in the mood, I'm afraid.
On a day like none other the blessed earth has ever seen... A day so fair as forty springtimes --
Where's your joy if you cannot sing?
She tossed her ring in the pond and bid me fetch it.  Said she'd marry me if I did.
And did you?
Look at that shot!  Three at once! I can't miss!
Nay, Sire, I'll cling to it as to life itself...
You promised!
But you did... you did!
It's my father, gone a-hunting.  The Baron Couer de Noir is his guest and must be provided with some sport.
Only were he a fool to boot.  See yon viper?
I detest serpents.
I've no fear of failure.  Your implications are most unbecoming.
What happened?
I don't know.  They've hurt the unicorn.
Damned hunters.  It was a trap, and you were the bait!
They tricked you.
There's no happier thought under heaven.
My heart intends no more than that you love me as I do you.
So, he's hiding in the dark...
Nay, dearest Jack... you are to be my husband.  I want none other.
Lili... I love you!
What's this now?
I bring you the only treasure worthy of your loveliness... for naught else in the universe rivals the reflected glory of your beauty.
You'll need the fastest steed alive, for Couer de Noir's castle rests at the very edge of the earth.  Only the sharpest sword and the golden armor of Achilles will protect you from his fury.
What became of the princess?
Don't be sad, Jack, not with me here to give you cheer.
I live in an abandoned fox den neath the roots of a thousand-year-old oak.  My bed is pine boughs and rabbit skins.  There's no need of weaponry to keep the maids away.
I'm partial to oaks, as are all faerie folk.  Mayn't I come visit sometime?
Only that?
I had no thought of offending you, Oona.
Jest with me then.
Oona... don't cry... please, you mustn't...
What care I for the human heart! Such a soft, spiritless thing it is. I prefer the hearts of hawks and wolves; fierce and free and keen as steel!
Master Jack!  Master Jack!  These woods are alive!  They're alive!
Your fond wishes give me strength, dear friends.
Can you show us the way?
To Castle Couer de Noir?
A castle's but stone and mortar --
Marco!
Oh.
Mom?
I'd be more comfortable if he slept in the guestroom.
Why?
Don't you have school?
What's today?
Can you keep Sam straight?
He's not gay.  I found out purely by accident, believe me.
He wouldn't use around me.  I don't like any of it.
My mother would die.
Where to?
You look better without make-up.
I can use your mom's.
You're off, you know?  You're way, way off.
Just, I mean, well, you're here every single day.
Will he talk to me?
It could have been a squirt gun.
how much weight have you lost?
I didn't recognize you!
I'm sorry.
You're here early today.
George, this is the third time.
Hello?
You'll know me by the time we're through.
I'm not going!
What are you doing?!
I can promise you complete privacy.
Where is it?
I've been using since I was twelve! You're all so unbelievably stupid.  You didn't give a shit about anything I did until now!
I gave up on you.
I was just thinking about my mom.  She wouldn't leave him.  I remember one time she made us dinner wearing sunglasses.  I mean it was dark outside and in.  But we never talked about it.
I loved him too much.
After everything he did to you and your mom?
After everything.
Are you taking them still?
The kind where there isn't really an answer.
I still don't know what that means.
What kind of house?
Your kid was down around Diver's Cover again, smoking pot.  I didn't write him up...told him I wouldn't tell you...
Thanks for telling me.
You should lock your doors.
Four days.  I left to think.
Severance pay.  And I'm going to cash in my life insurance policy.
I love those doors.
Friday...God, I hate the thought of him home all day.
I'll be by Saturday to pick him up.
One of you would end up dead.
George --
Didn't you once dream you could lick people well, though?
With your hands or your tongue?
What did I say?
I'm married.
Back.  Neck.  Back.
Been thinking?
What's your deal with Alyssa?
He said he heard hammering.
It's 1945. It's a different world now.
Not for me, it ain't.
Then what's the problem?
Well, alright then. What do you think about this new tie?
She's alright, isn't she?
Married?
Yes, sir.
Goodnight, Mr. Wilkins. Mr. Pike.
Cool it, Ray. You're gonna get us in a lot of trouble.
Did you go see my cousin Maynard like I asked you in my letter?
Ray Gibson?  No, no. He's the reason I'm in here, Daisy. For all I know, he's got a record a mile long. I got a better shot of getting out of here on my own. You tell Maynard to think about me, concentrate on me. Understand?
You're cute. You have any money, Claude?
I don't think so.
Here, this belongs to you.  It was empty when I found it.
I don't see where that's any of your business.
Look, man, I don't want friendly conversation. I don't want to be your friend. I've seen your friends and I don't like them. I just want to do this thing and get back to New York in time to start my job.
Like this?
Are you kidding? Tell me you don't want a slice of that pie right over there.
What are you complaining about? It worked out. Everything's cool. Now, come on, let's head down there and see what's shaking. We deserve a little reward.
It ain't here.
So?
So?
That's why we won't take the train. Cookie showed me where there's a farm house. They got a boat there.
Cut the bullshit. What do you want, Claude?
You did it, man! You got us out! Next stop, New York City!
I knew you wouldn't come if I didn't have a map.
That's right, we'll get off at the next stop. The train's pulling into the station right now.
Hundred and Sixty First Street? That's Yankee Stadium.
Give me back that hot dog. I'll eat it myself.
What you're dealing with here is a complete lack of talent.
Well, if that's the way it is...
I was sorry to hear about your mama passing.
Wilkins' driver's got the flu, so he asked me to fill in for him.
And what will we do when we get there? I'm sixty-five years old, Ray. So are you. What are we gonna do out here? Get married, have kids, settle down? That boat sailed without us, man.
I don't like it, I don't like it one bit. We shoulda taken that car when we had the opportunity. We'd be half way to New York by now.
That's because you're soft. Gimme the gun.
Why the hell not?
Soft and supple. Like a lady's.
That musta messed 'em up pretty bad.
I was already here a good many years when they came in in 1932.
Just like Elvis.
I can't take that, mama.
Hey, Ray, you ever been to the Cotton Club?
Last night? What are you talking about, Ray?
Understood.
Well maybe you should go back and talk it over with him.
Welcome to the party. It's so nice to see all of you here.
And he's dead serious.
You know, New Hell really only needs one new Satan.
It is awfully hot down here. How do you manage to stay so cool?
Okay, can I just ask you something? What do you know about your mom?
Oh my God, he just opened his mouth and swallowed that spit.
You're on Earth now, kid. Gonna have the same physical needs and limitations a human has. We'll stop by K-mart. Get you some warm clothes.
Look, it's okay for me to shit the street. But you gotta use a toilet.
We had the greatest afternoon of my life until Adrian made me tell her she had a heart-shaped ass.
Can I take him with me and have sex with his head?
Check one-two. Check one-two.
Nothing, Dad. Just re-arranging the furniture.
Who is this, Metal-lick-a?
This is bad, Nicky.
Well, I guess I'm going to have to take a mulligan on this one.
Thanks.
What was it called, sir.
Boogerland!
That's nice, Grandpa. Why don't you just enjoy the fishing?
So go get 'em, Jimmy!
I'm just a demon, Nicky. I don't got devil blood in me. I'd last two minutes up there with your brothers.
I've never been to Earth. I've never even slept over at some other dude's house!
Should we wake him up?
Which way did he go?
Oh, that's terrible, Reege...
Yes, great movie...
I'm not Nicky. I'm not home! I don't live here!
You gotta kill yourself.
My dad's in hell, and he's falling apart.
I'd love to have a dog. But I go to school full time. It wouldn't be fair to the dog.
I think I'm floating.
Why would you be floating?
Remember when I told you my Dad was in Hell?
..."The Devil?"...
I don't know.
No cubs over fifteen, Billy! Ever heard of a cub with a green flower? You'll leave Cathedral then, Billy, when you're on green, because they won't let a green stay here.  If you try to stay the young ones will gut-rip you apart!
Thanks.  I thought you'd be older. I expected a Red.
You need a lift. Let's go to Arcade and celebrate...  your alert successor... Logan-6.
I don't know what makes you so curious. You have any idea who his seed-mother was?
The damned Yellows are getting out of hand. Those three ought to be in Cathedral. No business scrambling in Arcade...
I just might look in on New You 483 myself.
What the hell took you so long?
Did you?
He's the one. You too. I remember. He was in a hurry. Just a face job. Dark hair, I said. Then he killed Doc and you grabbed me -- and the machine blew up and I ran... I ran.
When do you go up?
No.  Just no.
You felt sad. What's your name?
You're beautiful. Let's have sex.
But you put yourself on the circuit!
Of course.
You know something.
Some people say children need human mothering.
I'm only telling you what I've heard...  Haven't you ever wondered what your seed-mother was Like...?
When did you begin to question Lastday?
Just follow -- no matter how it seems...
I'm ashamed. I was bringing you to be killed.
That's nothing... there's a Sandman behind us, too and there'll be more soon. Take me to them.
Will you take me with you?
Do you think everything's going to turn to ice?
Maybe we're the first ones to get through...  Maybe Sanctuary is near, now... another protected place. It couldn't be outside.
You can have any woman in the city. What do you really want?
They all have names and numbers on them. I wonder what they are?
That sweet madman -- how could he come to exist?
Come with us.
Hello.
We don't get many Sandmen. I think we've only had one other since I've been here.
It's all right with me. Is he here?
How did you get here?
Gracious... no.
My parents thought so. Mother and Father. You know?
They're beautiful. May I have one too please?
What's beyond this place -- do you know?
Are you ready to put him in?
I don't know who you are. I'd like to thank someone.
Why not?
Why not?
We'll keep a watch on the house.
Now we'll see what this son of a bitch is up to.
How'd you get in with these fuckin' people?
Yes.
Alice...
Yeah? what did they want?
Please tell me.
His condition? What do you mean?
Repeat that, Bill.
Warden, it's not him. It was not Fred Madison in that cell.
Where is he now?
I couldn't say, sir... Captain Henderson?
What's the matter?
What is it?
I called, you know.
We've got to call the police.
Let's go home.
I don't remember... Anyway, Andy's okay...
Why? what is it? Why did you make me wait out here?
They're gonna cook him.
Andy would go for this, don't you think?... Firing squad, definitely.
Do they aim for the head or for the heart?
Beautiful! Smooth as shit from a duck's ass. Let's take a ride.
Look... It's late, Mr. Eddy... I ...
Yeah.
I don't know.
I don't know.
Yes, sir.
This is the only thing I was able to save when those heathens surrounded me.
Uh-huh.
It certainly is.
Yes.
Certainly not.
That's too bad. I got a half million shares. My whole foundation! And now look at me!
colossal nerve you have sitting there and talking about it so calmly - you, the swindler of thousands of people
Barney? Why should I? Never! We have nothing in common. Hmmpf, Barney! What effrontery!
Yeah. You know.
Hey Lovey, come here! Lovey, I asked for a glass of wine and look what I got. Come on, sit down.
There you are!
I'm going to sleep in my bed. Come on, Lovey!
They were in a quandary, and
That's what I say. What do you say to a rubber of bridge? I saw some cards in the other room.
Hey, hurry up, you slow-pokes - I'm starved!
Think of it! In times like these.
That's intelligent.
Why, we have no crime here. What makes a criminal?  Lack, usually. Avariciousness, envy, the desire to possess something owned by another. There can be no crime where there is a sufficiency of everything.
Very often.
And very true. Your lives are therefore, as a rule, shorter, not so much by natural death as by indirect suicide.
And he can arrange for the porters to take us back?
Suppose she should leave it?
I'm sorry, but we have no doctors here.
"Ungrateful fool . . . !"  Those were my very words to myself last night. "Here are these people in Shangri-La doing everything in their power to make our stay comfortable and happy and I haven't done one single thing to show my appreciation."
Oh, thank you. Thank you!
We were just going to bury him when you came along.
In that event, we better make arrangements to get some porters immediately. Some means to get us back to civilization.
Now, my dear boy. You shouldn't
It's astonishing - and incredible, but
That I be brought here? Who had that brilliant idea?
Yes.
Hello, Freshie. Did you make that report out yet?
Yes.
Don't worry, George. Nothing's going to happen. I'll fall right into line. I'll be the good little boy that everybody wants me to be. I'll be the best little Foreign Secretary we ever had, just because I haven't the nerve to be anything else.
He's dead.
What's it mean?
Hello, George.  Cigarette?
We've had plenty of it the last few days.
You talk as though you intend on staying.
I don't know.
Did I say "if"?
What's on your mind, Bob? You talk as though we're going to have trouble getting out of here.
George, I've been putting things together. Do you notice the resemblance between those natives and the pilot? And why did those clothes materialize so conveniently when they met us at the plane? Chang himself just said that they never venture beyond that point. What brought them there? Unless it was to meet us?
I'm tired of owing you things. You're free to go. Go ahead.
What do you mean - "fade away like an echo"?
So everyone is serenely happy in Shangri-La? Nobody would ever think of leaving?  It's all just so much rot! She's pleaded with me ever since I came here to take her away from this awful place. She's cried in my arms for hours, for fear I'd leave her behind. And what's more, she's made two trips to the plateau to bribe the porters - for me!
What about the others?
Where were you hiding?
What if he refuses?
I don't know. He must have had some purpose in taking the plane away from Fenner.  When he lands, we'll find out.
What do you suggest?
At the mercy of a mad pilot.
You suggested my being brought here, didn't you? What gave you the idea I'd fit in?
Oh, you've read my books. You do more things! What have my books got to do with it?
Yes, I know.
I'm thirty.
I'm so glad.
Ouch!
It would serve you right if you were left behind.
I tell you, we're going west, and Shanghai is east of here!
EXCUSE ME
You promised to come for tea yesterday. I waited for so long.
I'll make some for you!  You will come today?
Please say you will. The days are so very long and lonely without you.  Please . . .
All right, I'll be there.
Thank you.
The hell happened?
No. just peace on Earth.
They don't?
It'll make sense later?
She didn't even know you. .
Well, Mr. Intuition... When the neighbors report screaming and we hear nothing but silence, what does that lead you to believe?
Then wouldn't we also know if he's here?
There's gotta be a hundred pawn shops in downtown Philadelphia.  I take it there's a reason we're going to this one.
And what's this ... ?
Ernie Goose?  Cynthia?
Jesus...
What if he's telling the truth?
Cause I've been doing this thirty years and if I don't know when something doesn't feel right by now--
Kay, you're scaring your partner.
I haven't been training a partner -- I've been training a replacement.
Right, right-- I like that stuff.
Exactly.  I very much enjoy that.
Why not?
But it's definitely a nest, isn't it?
Is it my eyes... or is that thing a little...
They respond to fear, right?
Your licence is revoked. Permanently.
And I'm arranging deportation papers.
Pardon me.  I hate to break up this lovely little group hug, but we people aren't ready for what we have.  How is this going to help?
Er. well, nowhere special.
Oh yeah?  Well if you're suddenly such a good samaritan, why didn't you file a departure report, like you're supposed to?  You know how many rules you've just broken?
Noon exactly.
Wouldn't happen to be the Lincoln Memorial, would it?
They're not my pals--
I don't think it's a tradeoff you really want to make.  Now give it to me-- I can reverse the effects if you give it to me now.
Which way?
Jupiter, actually. well, one of the moons.
I'm getting a trajectory...
Anderton --
Someplace safe.
I always wondered what the world would be like.  But now that I've seen it, I don't need to see any more.  It's all right.  Once I'm in the tank, I won't remember any of this.
The drowning woman.  Anne... But it was too late.  Her little girl was already gone.
Just some guy... they found.
That's not much.
It's all I could safely move.
You made those tapes...
I can't even stand up --
Lara --
I'm fine.
I can't.  They're following me right now.  They'll meet me there. They'll halo me.
Uh, sir...
Everybody runs.
Send a DCPD blue & white out there, set up a perimeter and tell 'em we're en route.  What's our confirmed time?
Look at the kid.  In this one, he's on the left of the man in the suit.
Jad.  How come you're not out there with Father Witwer?
Confirm with trig and image.
I'm sorry Danny, but I'll have to give you the full tour later on.
Because it was going to fall.
You're certain?
The fact that you prevented it from happening doesn't change the fact that it was going to happen.
There's no question.  You don't have any.
You gonna tell on me?
She's got information inside of her.  I need you to get it out.
Okay... now let me time you.
Oh, Sean --
The more you want to believe something, the easier it is to be fooled.
I don't know -- I never saw his face.  All I know is, the next day I was out, so the guy must've had juice somewhere.  Look, man, you gotta go through with this.
Yes, I'm afraid that would be from the Doll's Eye.
I'm not.  I was trying to heal them, not turn them into... something else.
You say some of the children died?
How can you avoid a man you've never met?
Does Burgess know about this? About the Minority Report?
Hold that thought.
If... you have one.
It's always in the more gifted of the three.
This is all my fault.
Congratulations, sir.
According to the Sentry, Anderton was watching this at Containment right before he was tagged.
Uh, yeah, being concert master of the Philadelphia Symphony Orchestra is one of our most popular choices...
I think you're swell company, Knott.
People, if you don't let the spyder scan you, we'll have to come in and arrest you.
Raincheck?
Thanks.  You take anything in your coffee?
So you haven't seen his apartment?
I haven't seen him in two years.
Shhh!  They're sleeping.
What does he want with a precog?
Hi, uh, excuse me. I'm here to see Mr. Reuben.
Here. Take it. Bring me back eighty.
Yeah. Take it.
What, sir?
What if I gave you forty?
It's as good a suite as we have, unless you want two bedrooms.
Thank you, sir.
Women?
I don't know, Forum's pretty hot tonight. It might be hard to get in, though.
Manhattan.
You girls aren't from Brooklyn or anything?
I don't get it. What do you do?
Will you leave me alone, already...? No, Sean, it's over... I don't care... As a matter of fact, I am... Yeah. In his hotel room...
Holy shit.
Bullshit.
No.
Chloe?
No.
Who's watching the baby?
What'd you say?
There's no touching.
Look, man, I'm the bachelor, alright? I gave her a hundred bucks in tips alone --
I -- I -- I... Don't...
What's your record at?
He making the drop?
A million. Easy.
That prick tried to get Jessica to blow him in the bathroom --
Who the fuck do you think you're talking to? This ain't a fucking democracy. You want out?
I gotta tell you, Mr. Reuben, I'm not comfortable getting in any deeper. It's one thing to look after Jess...
I already told you, I parked it for five minutes and I locked it with the club --
There won't be a next thing.
That's him. Now you all know the drill, right?
Don't 'easy Ruiz' me. Y'all turned a Easter egg hunt into a butt-fuck-a- thon.  Bring me four eggs Benedict and a mimosa. You all want mimosas?
A bad heart.
Where's the drop?
Hi. I'm Jimmy.
Where is the Soho Grand?
Harlem? What is it, a restaurant?
Thanks a lot. Don't worry about it.
You said if you didn't have a winning record after eleven fights, you'd talk to Max.
So, it's not a winning record.
This is the opportunity of a lifetime. What are you? Nuts? You've been waiting for this kind of opportunity.
Nice work.
C'mon, man, not in front of the baby. Put on your seat belt before I get another ticket.
I'm not taking her to a bar.
She wants you to paint the ashtray.
I don't know.
I'll get the girl.
We're not supposed to get drunk. We're on call.
Shhh... Hello, room service?
How much? Okay. Make it fifteen minutes and you can add on a ten dollar tip. Bye.
Yeah, I guess.
Don't even start.
Motherfucker...
You just don't fucking get it, do you?
You know he fucks all his girls, don't you?
Well, I thought you understood and I was just missing it.
Why you gotta make everything difficult?
You too?
Hey, Jimmy, where they taking us?
Wait a minute. You want to look at fucking penguins now?
Why?
Three and a half hours?
He's on the list.
A little.
Cool. See you later.
It's in your copy of Hemispheres. I believe it's Mickey Blue Eyes.
Drinks are free, right?
It means you got a gun?
Why? What I say bad?
Well, he ain't gonna be around no more.
I've heard you've got the best coke in the States. The shit back home is pants.
Yeah.
A lot of Persians?
I call 'em wiggers.
Yeah, bring us four fernet.
dollars in c-notes, a numeric pager, a double-A battery, and a first class round-trip ticket to JFK.
Yes. You're going to New York.
What?
You looking good, Little. Real clean. Clean as the Board of Health. But you missing something.
What?
Solid, daddy.
Sometimes you got a big ugly mouth.
Shit, what else she gonna say?
I'll give you back the 600.
Yeah.
Put it in a cup of water. It's nutmeg.
Man, what do you want?
Cause I don't want to walk around with my head all nappy, looking like --
Like what? Looking like me? Like a nigger?! Why don't you want to look like what you are? What makes you ashamed of being black?
Leggo. I got to wash it out.
Okay, okay.
They sure ain't no black man's books in here.
"I'm telling you God's words, not to hustle."
Do you?
We need more young warriors like yourself, stick around and we shall see if your heart is true.
What?
I'm sorry. I've had you on your feet for hours.
I can handle it.
No, good Sisters are rare. We need every one. Tell me something: how tall are you?
Why do you ask?
What do you think?
Talk about what?
The talk is everywhere!
"Both women, in their 20's, charged they had had intimacies with Elijah Muhammad since 1957..."
Dear heart, you have to help me. I'm raising our kids practically by myself, while you're running all over the world. You don't know how many times the girls ask me when is daddy coming home?
Shhh!
I'm tired of praying.
The way I feel, I ought not to go out there today. In fact, I'm going to ease some of this tension by telling the black man not to fight himself -- that's all a part of the white man's big maneuver, to keep us fighting amongst ourselves, against each other. I'm not fighting anyone, that's not what we're here for.
That's right.
I told you we don't know for certain.
Sure, man.
Two years in the Women's Reformatory at Framingham.
Let's go.
I think sometimes, Mrs. Little, candor is the only kindness.
You'll regret this, Mrs. Little.
What mission?
I forgot to tell you I'm wearing a bulletproof vest.
Don't never try to cross someone who ain't afraid to die.
Head nigger in charge?
I'm Minister Malcolm X. Two witnesses saw him brought in. He was not brought out.
Who the hell are they?
Brother Minister he often talked about you. He loves you, loves you like his own son. Says you are the best, his greatest Minister but that someday you would leave him and turn against him.
Then I hope the one who gets me has got lots of kids. What do you want?
[How does it work?]
[What's the PIN number?]
[The number you use at the bank machine.]
[What money?]
[The bible says, "Be not overcome of evil, but overcome evil with good."]
Who's he?
[I see him sometimes at the handball court in Chapultepec on a Saturday afternoon.]
So how's business?
You did something on impulse?
And what if, just say, there was a kidnap attempt?
Then one day, he calls and says, 'I'm in love and I'm moving to Mexico.' I said what happened to the plan?
Cut the stock here. The barrel here. Make sure you file it smooth.  Rocket launchers?
They'll be back in a week.
I had to do my homework on them when I worked there. Also I enjoy history.
You don't flinch when a gun goes off; you react. You go. Don't listen for the sound; don't anticipate it. Concentrate on the sound itself.
I'm not afraid you, Creasy.
Then be trained.
Like St. Jude. A hopeless case that has a complete block about 'C' Minor. But remember, "Whoever resists authority will bring judgement upon themselves." New Testament, Romans 13.
Where are you?
The family paid the ransom and he was returned two days later.  His father still hasn't gotten up the nerve to ask him if they fucked him up the ass.
For a year?
For an American she understands this country very well.
[No. Why?]
Good news. You're going back to school.
Our child's safety is at stake.
Hmm?
[Because he's outside. Because he's not tied to the same system we are.]
Pollo Pibil. Chicken and chorizo sausage. Hmmmh. They marinate it in lemon and orange juice. It's a stew really.
Two tourists who never went home.
You and Creasy both. A two man army according to Interpol. Panama. Lebanon with the Druze. Desert Storm. Where you were contracted by the U.S. Army to hunt down elite Iraqi military commanders.  You two were a married couple.
Pinta Martin Ramos is just a number to you. Tragic, a public outcry, but a number. One more dead.
I told you she wasn't attractive...
Well, we oughta do something. It's Saturday night. I don't wanna go bowling like last Saturday. How about calling up that big girl we picked up inna movies about a month ago in the RKO Chester?
That big girl that was sitting in front of us with the skinny friend.
Yeah, sure.
There was one nice-looking one there inna black dress and beads, but she's dancing now.
Where?
I'm gonna take Clara home. It's close to one.
Who you gonna call?
Marty, let's go downna Seventy-Second Street area tonight.
Angie. He says she was a real scrawny- looking thing.
Who?
So I am an old garbage bag, put inna street.
Oh, Catherine, please! Don't make a tragedy. You come to my house where you know you be happier yourself.
These are the worst years. I tell you. It's gonna happen to you. I'm afraida look inna mirror. I'm afraid I'm gonna see an old lady with white hair, like the old ladies inna park, little bundles inna black shawl, waiting for the coffin. I'm fifty- six years old. What am I to do with myself? I have strength in my hands. I wanna cook. I wanna clean. I wanna make dinner for my children. Am I an old dog to lie in fronta the fire til my eyes close? These are the terrible years, Theresa! Terrible years!
Hey, I come home from your house last night, Marty was here with a girl.
Were the lights on?
They're the worst. College girls are one step from the streets. They smoke like men inna saloon. My son Joseph, his wife, you know, she types onna typewriter. One step from the streets, I tell you. Mrs. Pilletti ponders this philosophy for a moment.
Yes, I know.
No, Marty, please...
Nothing.
We better get started to your house, because the buses only run about one an hour now.
Siddown, siddown. You want some chicken? We got some chicken in the ice box.
No, thank you, really, Mrs. Pilletti.
It's a very sad business, I tell you. A woman, fifty-six years old, all her life, she had her own home. Now she's just an old lady, sleeping on her daughter-in-law's couch. It's a curse to be a mother, I tell you. Your children grow up and then what is left for you to do? What is a mother's life but her children? It is a very cruel thing when your son has no place for you in his home.
Well, maybe that's what they teach you in New York University. In real life, it don't work out that way. You wait till you are a mother.
Yeah. I was just asking you if you was here stag or with a girl.
That's the one.
Well, I understand the problem about the supermarkets, but I was talking to this girl last night, and she made the point that a likeable personality is a valuable business asset.
Sure. This girl said...
Oh, we got plenny-a room here.
Oh, Thomas. Ma, it's just a big dance hall, and that's all it is. I been there a hundred times. Loaded with tomatoes. Boy, you're funny, Ma.
Ma, when are you gonna give up? You gotta bachelor on your hands. I ain't never gonna get married.
Sooner or later, there comes a point in a man's life when he gotta face some facts, and one fact I gotta face is that whatever it is that women like, I ain't got it. I chased enough girls in my life. I went to enough dances. I got hurt enough. I don't wanna get hurt no more. I just called a girl just now, and I got a real brush-off, boy. I figured I was past the point of being hurt, but that hurt. Some stupid woman who I didn't even wanna call up. She gave me the brush. I don't wanna go to the Stardust Ballroom because all that ever happened to me there was girls made me feel like I was a bug. I got feelings, you know. I had enough pain. No, thank you.
How'd you come home, Ma? Thomas give you a ride?
I don't like her.
I look over at this one nexta me, not bad, about thirty-five -- Hiya, Marty...
The nurses Leo and me picked up last night. We got a date with them tonight.
That's the big tall one, the fellow with the moustache.
He says okay, it's all right Catherine comes here.
Hello, Aunt Theresa.
Well...
No, Virginia, I know how you feel.
That's all right, that's all right...
Okay.
Tommy!
Tommy...
Never this close.
Yeah, maybe move that nurse in. She don't seem the type to keep you awake praying.
What are you going to do with him?
I mean, what were you doing? Were you a resident or on a staff someplace?
Where?
Hospital.
I don't know what else. You've been that route a little, haven't you?
What?
There might be another tiny piece we missed. I want to look around before we close up.
Where you from with that crazy way of talking?
The chest-cutter.
Sixteen times.
What's he got to write, for God's sake?
Me, too. Y'all just seen me play my last game.
If we had closer relations, there wouldn't be any misunderstandings. That's where a football game would help. Between your outfit and mine.
Special Services in Tokyo are all for it. They say it's one of the main gimmicks we have to keep the American way of life going here in Asia.
Gimme three.
Hawkeye's asking the Major's opinion on a point of anatomy.
...But I turned in my knee pads.
We'll need room. The sixth rib goes.
He only lasted one season.
It isn't always this rough?
You have a certain modest charm yourself.
Same here.
I don't make the distinction. But the sex urge is a powerful force. In women just as much as men.
Even if I weren't.
Though I guess who it'll really be rough on is your husband.
You're asking for somebody else?
You please excuse...  I have been making examination of this young man to find if he will be soldier in our army.
Thanks, Reverend. Thank you both for tipping me off.  You don't know a Captain Forrest or a Captain Pierce, do you?
They missed the boat.
Glad to know you. Drop in at my clinic anytime you feel like playing a little poker, or even if a tooth is bothering you.
There's this native broad works in the laundry. I don't know if you've noticed.
Now I know that's been my problem since I was a kid. But it only caught up to me last night.
Just about enough to say goodbye to everybody.  Line up over here, men, if you want to pay your last respects. Keep moving and file on out when you're through.
Okay, Lieutenant Dish. I guess she's already... involved with somebody here.
Don't come so quickly when I call. I want you to take these officers...
Morning, Radar. How were things?
Thank you, Spearchucker. I'll certainly take a look at these. Where the hell did you ever get that name?
Well, there's one big satisfaction.
Action?
Yes, you're sore at the world. Come on, now.
Never mind those guys. All right, stand up. Now let's see what you look like when you protest.
Oh, yuh did, huh?
Of course not. He wouldn't be.
You were? I thought you were chasing me?
Better let me talk to him.
Devoted entirely to the interests of all the John Does all over the country. Which practically means, ninety per cent of the voters. He will also announce the third party's candidate for the presidency. A man whom he, personally, recommends. A great humanitarian; the best friend the John Does have.
There's enough in it for a hundred speeches, things people ought to hear nowadays. You be careful of it, won't you dear?  It's always helped keep your father alive for me.
That's right. But you have a piece of property that still belongs to this newspaper. And I'd like to have it!
The letter.
You made it up.
He's perfect! A baseball player. What could be more American!
Oh.
And you! Start pounding that typewriter. Oh, boy! This is terrific!  No responsibilities on our part. Just statements from John Doe and we can blast our heads off.
No.
Oh, let me go, will you!
What do you do when you work?
Did you find her?
Ann! Say, why didn't yuh
Hey, Doc, look. Look, Doc. Gimme that again, will yuh? Who's gonna get him?
Well, I'll be doggoned if over forty people don't show up. 'Course none of us knew what to do, but we sure got a kick out of seeing how glad everybody was just to say hello to one another.
And then we started to find out about a lot of other people.
Well, sir, about a dozen families got together and gave Grubbel a job watering their lawns. Isn't that wonderful? And then we found jobs for six other people and they've all gone off relief!
It must be some kind of a gag.
Sure, you are.
What was I doin' up there makin' a speech, anyway? Me? Huh?  Gee, the more I think about it the more I could . . .
Tear down all the fences. Why, if you tore one picket off of your neighbor's fence he'd sue you!
Join the John Doe Club.
Hello, Mr. Connell.
You're all wet. Miss Mitchell writes those speeches and nobody can make her write that kind of stuff.
Go down to the office and arrange for some radio time.
Why, D. B., you're not going to fall for
Run a story. Say John Doe was in here, and is sorry he wrote the letter and
If you ask me, Hank, you're playing around with dynamite.
No.
It's not a lie! Nickels and dimes! To stuff into their own pockets! You can read all about it in the newspapers there!
Ah, you bet your life you didn't! You look in your papers, ladies and gentlemen, and you'll find Miss Mitchell's signed confession that she was the one that wrote it!
That's too bad.
Shh!
I didn't see anything.
Is there a crowd in the street?
Then he may be caught on a ledge! Look again!
We don't know how much time we have. If I can get in to talk to him -- maybe we won't lose anyone.
Mind if we make a stop on the way? We busted Frank Antonucci on possession. He gave us a lead on that Polk Street jewelry heist.
Perhaps for his own reasons he entangled me in this... situation.
You told Antonucci that shit came from me.
Particles, man. I feel them all the time. I feel them in my arms and legs man, that's how they punish me.
They have less power over you if you look into my eyes.
Tell my dad.
I hate fucking Springfield.
The Old Guy? What kind of show of faith is that? I want Debbie.
You signed out twice.
Hi, Roper.
Did you check out DMV for any vehicles registration?
Roper...
Open your shirt.
Satisfied?
How do you feel after a shooting.
I grew up in Oakland... Crossed the Bay Bridge and here I was.  So you're looking for "fast advancement".
Is there something wrong with that?
You living together?
Oh, "city girl". Don't you ever long for companionship with her such a long way away in New Jersey?
Get good at it.
You know the ten commandments?
Yes.
My name's McCall. I'm unarmed.
See the favorite? Tail up. Washy. He doesn't want to run today. Cross him off... Now the Six looks good. On his toes. Coat shiny. This trainer/jockey combo does well. We can't leave him out.  What do you think?
To run last?
The jockey!
We won.
There's your answer. He's smart.
I thought I could do it. I was so damn sure of myself. But I didn't know what to say. The words wouldn't come. My mouth turned to mush. You make it look so easy, Roper. But it is not. It's not easy.  It's a different job than looking through the rifle scope.
Roper. Metro Division. Hostage Negotiator. Give me the short version.
Same thing happened to me, man. She cheated on me, but I forgave her. You know why?
Ray, think about how she looked when you married her. Think about how happy you were. Don't lose that, man. Don't give up everything.
Who the fuck are you, Mother Teresa?
Ronnie, forget this what's-his-name.
Hey.
What do you think?
Scottie, remember the day you lost that hostage in union square. You came over that night and we made mad, crazy love. But I didn't even know what happened... 'til I heard it on the news the next morning.
Korda escaped.
Hmm?
Yeah.
I was just thinking...  There's something special I want to talk to you about.  I think it's time we went to a whole other phase in our relationship.  A deeper level.
What if you die and no one can do what you do as well as you do it?
It's been decided that you take on another partner and train him to be able to take over for you.
You let us worry about that.
Who's running it!
This is Halden.
You're in there.  Everybody dies, you go with them --
She said I have a son...
As long as it's not 'what's your sign?'
This is how you pick up women --
Who are you?!
No.
But what would happen to me?  I have no body to return to.
Divinity?
You were the one who was dying.
Unlimited energy out there.  Enough to run this world for all eternity --
-- But you'll never be able to get it through the maze.
Only up there in the dream they called life.
Unfinished business.
You sure he's going to come?
Who?
Won't be time if he gets access --
We can be there in fifteen minutes and rip him off the system.
Because why the hell would you be interested in a program that allows people to live inside your machines?  I mean how much profit could there possibly be from owning the universe and selling space in it to people who are dying, or people who are just God-Damned sick of this world --
What?
The truth.
Just like that?
Don't know what you're talking about.
Connection approved.  Ready to transmit --
Male.
Standard, modern, upscale --
I can hardly walk...
In a place that came to be known as Angel Grove.
To assist you I have retro-fitted your helmets with new Opti-Scan devices.
Two thirty three a.m.
Let's go after him!!
GET OFF ME!
Isn't this just TYPICAL!  We finally do somebody a good turn and just look what happens!
How the heck?!...
There seems to be some confusion about your registration. I believe I can find you a place at the Ambassador. Many persons of the Jewish faith find it quite...
Ya still owe me fifty bucks for the train ticket.
Torrio ain't like them guys. He thinks like an American. You'd like him, Charlie. He'd like you.
Why should you be payin' me when we're all equals?
No. Not everything.
What do you mean?
Scotch is a very valuable commodity these days.
You got men on Profaci's place?
You ain't even a man yet.
Why? You're the innocent one.
If I look weak now, it's over.
You fellas got names?
Bugsy, you and I don't need to be in business with Maranzano. We got more jobs than we can handle. That's not the problem.
At least Masseria plays by the rules. Maranzano thinks he's God, and the rules don't apply.
Meyer.
So we end up with everybody but the two Bosses, at our meet. We ain't sayin' we're the leaders, but we're leadin'.
After all this time I'd think you'd know me better, Meyer.
What you mean? Tommy ain't done nothin'.
Why's it gotta be Tommy!
I know. When the storm hits, it don't pay to be caught outside.
He's trying to make it.
If I wanted ta kill ya, I woulda done it long ago. It's not like you ain't given me reason.
I'm still the Boss of All the Bosses! And you'll do what I say!
Take one of 'em out, and they'll all line up against us.
Don Maranzano. Welcome.
Salvatore. My young Caesar. First me, Sallie. Then you.
Mussolini is raping Sicily like every Roman before him. So our brothers are coming to America. Soldiers willing to fight and die. Men who know the meaning of honor.
I found that out.
Why didn't you tell me that Maranzano had made you an offer?
Jeez, Bugsy. Ya like ta scared the crap outta me.
Know something Tommy? You're a mensch.
How do you get from <u>here</u> - to <u>there</u>?
Switch hands.
What's the maximum safe dose?
Olive. - Where exactly am I?
You're mad at me. Great. You have every right to be. But we're both mad at Dark Town. We're both mad at Hypnos.
I'm a simple man. I'm just doing my job. I <u>enjoy</u> my job. Why does everyone want to make it difficult for me? Stealing tickets, switching bodies...it is <u>so</u> <u>irresponsible</u>.
If it wasn't for that comic strip of yours, I wouldn't be doing this. But a good chuckle is darned hard to come by. <i></i> That one where Monkeybone stole the soap cake out of the urinal - I thought I would die.
It's irregular, but...I just love that strip of yours. I figure I'll take the "Family Circus" guy instead.
Death! Thank you!
Well, nothing. It's a benefit. But we could probably get <u>People</u> and <u>Entertainment Tonight</u> to cover it.
I don't want to be rich. It's just a trap!
My life was totally crappy, Herb, and she... fixed it. She made me happy. Which I'd never been. She loves me the way I am - <u>right now</u>. <i></i> I don't want everything to change. I don't want her saying yes to some big success. I just want her saying yes to me.
The Nightmare Juice! It's gone! Somebody switched it for a beaker of grape Kool-Aid!!
You're Death's <u>brother</u>?
It's simple, Stu. We need nightmares - lots of 'em. So whenever we can swing it, we send a guy up to stimulate the flow...a <u>nightmare maker</u>! Like Steve here. Poe. Rasputin...we've been doing this all the way back to Atilla and Genghis Khan!
Sure. Why?
Me? Nowhere. I was asleep.
Boy, the nuts are out tonight. What'd that creep call you - ?
They don't love me. They love Monkeybone.
Can't you give it to me later?
The monkey!! He's everywhere! He'll take over both our lives if we let him.
I'm trying. It's weird, that's all. I never had any good luck, until I met you...what if it's all just another bad dream?
What's the "bad" part?
I might wake up.
Oh, Stu. Tell me I'm not dreaming.
Oh, Julie...my poor Stu...my poor baby brother...
You're such a beautiful man. Look at you - stuck in this place, and only thinking of her.
How am I gonna get past the guards?
Pact? Pact? NO LIFE SUPPORT??
Stu, you have my <u>absolute confidence</u>. - DEAD MAN! DEAD MAN WALKING!!
You saved my life, Monkeybone. I never would've made it without you.
Well, I'd love to see inside your club.
I just can't seem to focus on anything these days.
What about the fellow in those pictures?
You know ...  ... whoops!
What do you think?  I left it on the curb?
Not me, sonny. I'm just going to sit around and listen.  What's this?
Look out for those fellows--they tell the truth about you--sometimes. That corner over there is reserved for guides and sightseers who come in for five minutes to rest their feet. That section over there is reserved for Senator's friends. The front row--the empty one--is for the President and White House guests-- see that old couple over there-- they've attended every session for the last twenty years. Over the clock back here is the Diplomatic section. They and the page boys are the only real class we have in this place. The rest are mostly people who come here like they go to the zoo--
Here--let me give you a Boy Ranger button.
I--I discussed it with him--yes-- because I--you see, I've always had this camp in mind--but I made no contract with him!
Eight to five Little Boy Blue is plastered.
Tell me why!
Would you settle for a husband?
No--don't do it. I'm sure. The truth is, Diz--there's no man I've seen yet or--must be something wrong with me. I've been feeling low for weeks.
Get my *whole* fall outfit--and quit this job in style!
Yeah.
Good idea. When?
Tonight?
Tunnel?
Yeah--that's right. Diz--
Okay--I mean--
Susan? Nah!
Well--let's dig up the preacher, kid.
The war's on!
Diz!
Yes, Joe, yes--right away. 
How do you feel, champ?
I *can't* wait, McGann! You go into that room and tell Jim Taylor and Joe Paine that I give them *one more minute*--
*You won't?*
No. No. A signal service to the State. Yes, indeed. And not only that but-- uh--I've heard of your excellent work in leading and guiding our youth--
I *thought* I heard... Yes?
Washington!
Yeah, for the fifth time, Senator-- Washington.
Just a minute, I better make sure.
Look! There it is!
Will the Senator yield for a question?
You don't have to tell me Jeff. We were a team, the two of us, a struggling editor and a struggling lawyer. The twin champions of lost causes, they used to call us.
Yes, Ma found him slumped over his desk that morning...
Well--goodnight.
Jeff! You're trying to understand in a moment everything about a project that took two years to set up--the reasons--the benefits--
Yield *how*, sir?
Mr. President--
Just fine.
Gee--I'm sorry about that, Miss--you *are* Miss Saunders, aren't you?
Yes, I'm Saunders--and this is Mr. Moore--a member of the press. Meet the *Senator*, Mr. Moore.
Now, if you're ready, Senator, we can start for the hotel. I'll *see* that you get there.
The Capitol Dome! Lighted up!
You--uh--you better relax, Senator. You'll be plumb wore out.
I had a lot to do with that little press conference last night--
Sure! A Bill. Senator Paine and I decided it was the one way in the world I could make myself--
Oh--dinner. Yes. Well, I'm hungry, too. I thought--maybe--we could have something brought in--you know, like big executives who eat off trays. You see, we've got to light into this and get it going--
Uh-huh. Well, dinner comes in on trays. We're executives. And we light into this. It is dawn. Your Bill is ready. You go over there and introduce it--
How?
We're over in the House.
Uh--have you?  Did you ever have so much to say about something--you couldn't say it?
Try sitting down.
He did?
Now, this camp is going to be out in your state, of course--
I also answer to whistles.
You--you've *got* a first name, haven't you?
I know. It's--Violet.
No, I haven't. I guess I thought the name was familiar.  By the way, you discussed with Senator Paine where the camp was to be situated and everything?
No--not today! Boy, I feel like a house afire! Saunders--how did I do?
Gee--I hope so. What's all this?
Already? All these letters?
Do you want to dictate them?
Thanks a lot.
I don't care *what* you've done! Don't quit. Don't grab a measly chance like this to save a few pieces--other men could--but not you. As long as you lived, you'd remember you ran out and threw this country of yours to the jackals--!
Hurray!
You're not going to take your *suit* off!
However, Senator Smith is still a member of this Body and as such has equal claim on the attention of the Chair--
"--We hold these truths to be self- evident, that all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights--"  Well--looks like the night shift's comin' on.
Since the time of Adams--not Washington.
I said--I mean--Washington didn't live to see it finished. Congress didn't move here from Philadelphia till eighteen hundred.
Yes. Washington laid the cornerstone though--wearing an apron for the ceremony that was embroidered by Madame Lafayette--
Oh--nothing--nothing. My idea is-- for the Government to lend us the money--and the boys'll pay it back-- sending in a penny or a nickel--no more than a dime--no, gosh--the Government's got enough on its hands without--
My, my--you sho' are pahwerfully upset, Mister McGann--but you' awfully cute.
My daughter isn't here to carry out assignments like that for *anybody*.
Well, then--this is too much for *my* lame brain. I'm calling Jim Taylor.
No?
You're the best nurse I can think of--
Nice *compliment*!
And I'm an old hand at following instructions--
Yes--
I thought I could, too.  *My* business--this fine future! I have no future I *care* about, if this boy is broken! I--I can't sleep. The only important thing in my life now is to save what I can for him. I want him to get a start again--I'll see that he's taken care of as long as he lives--!  Saunders--whether you ever mean anything to him or not--
That'd be a crime--after all this work--getting it buried in this Deficiency Bill as nice as you please-- approved--all ready to roll--
How much does the Willet Dam mean to you, Jim?
Wait a minute--Jim--you didn't ask *Smith* over here!
Oh, I see. Out steamroller methods are getting too hard to your sensitive soul, is that it, Joe? The Silver Knight is getting to big for us. My methods have been all right for the past twenty years, Joe, since I picked you out of a fly-specked hole in the wall and blew you up to look like a Senator, and now you can't stand it. Well, maybe you won't have to stand it, Joe. Maybe we can fix it so you and your Boy Ranger can go home together.
Oh, it's all right--it's all right. It seems a shame, though, to part company like this after all these years, especially now with a national convention coming up. Joe, I've put everything I have behind you. And so did all of our friends, but I guess we'll survive. We'll just have to find somebody else that's got a little more sense, that's all. In the meantime, you explain to Mr. Smith about Willet Dam. It's your bill-- it's your reputation, and if he can't find enough facts to break you with, you just send him to me and I'll give him a couple of good ones. I'm taking the next plane home.
You can't say *that* to--
Here, here, Susan--this is Jeff Smith-- our new Senator.
All right, we'll take Jeff with us--
Such pretty knees for a big boy!
Mr. President...
Is there objection?  You may proceed, Senator.
Are you married?
I don't mind though. I had a lot of fun doing it.
It's obviously a frameup! They're trying to railroad this man for the money they can get out of him!
Thank you, Your Honor. Are you employed by the Morning Mail?
Are these the articles?
Are they true!
NO!!
It isn't all! I'd like to explain
Oh. What's happening about the opera?
Have you seen the papers?
I say, to most people it's a washout.
You must have met a lot of swell society girls since you've been here. Don't you like them?
He played in the town band, too.
Oh, I suppose you could do better.
Sure. Look! You sing it over again, and I'll do "Humoresque" with you.
You know what I've been doing since I got home? Been working on a poem.  It's about you.  Sometimes it's kinda hard for me to say things - so I write 'em.
Let's just walk, okay?
No, I don't mind.
A girl?
Yeah, then what?
Huh?
It don't look as though we're gonna get any pictures tonight.
I wonder if they'd want to make it a quartet.
Miss Dawson on the phone, sir.
Yes, sir.
That goo. That stuff that tastes like soap.
But your honor
Yes, I know. My first concern is to locate the lucky man. When I do, it's your job to keep the newspapers away from him.
I can't find him.
Why, no.
You're not my attorney yet, Mr. Cedar. Not till I find out what's on your mind. Suppose you get the books straightened out quick so I can have a look at them.
Well, whenever I run across a funny name, I always like to poke around for a rhyme. Don't you?
Oh, I don't mean that. I'm sure I'm going to need your help.
Oh, sure. Sure. We don't want to fire Arthur.
That's funny. Why is that?
I can't hold out on you any longer. Lamb bites wolf.  Beautiful.
Entertainment?
He's the shipping clerk at the Tallow Works. Wants a $2 raise - or he'll quit.
And what'd you do to those bodyguards? They quit this morning. Said you locked them up.
But what about this "Cinderella Man"?
Now, where were we?
Here's the order for the plows. We got a good price on them.
I leave it to you, Mr. Deeds. Can you conceive of any court not being in sympathy with any woman who gave up the best years of her life for an old man like your uncle?
I'd like to get in my two cents' worth.
Anything else, Mr. Deeds?
What is your name?
Christian Svenson.
Farmer?
Yeah. What?
Nice day out - er, nice night - wasn't it? - isn't it?
No, sir.
You're Walter, aren't you?
Prairie? Oysters?
Hey, did you hear that?
What do they want from me?  What have I done that's so wrong?  They act as though they don't have their own peculiar things... They do! Believe me. Everybody's got something...  Even you probably have things.
You can go out there if you like...
It's my daughter Sofie... she's gotta problem.
Why's that?
Better make yourself comfortable. We got a three hour drive here.
My mentor was an amazing teacher named Benton Mandlebaum. Died quite tragically in the collapse of a gazebo.
-- 'cause in that instant I saw the beginning of a vixen's smile and I knew --
Stop now.
Go to hell.
My guess is these images were burned into your brain when you were young. Maybe if we could nail down the exact fantasies that are haunting you -- maybe you could get past them... Anyway, I thought we could try an experiment.
Whoa, whoa, what are you doing? I want to know what's in here.
What brought this on?
Doc. Nice to meet you.
I think you'll like this. Know much about Cuban cigars?
Are you a man who likes to treat himself right?
Well, in '85 four of us left our firms and formed an investment banking venture. We've got twenty-three people working there now.
We've done... very well. You know anything about addiction, Doc?
Tastes good.
No... I mean about Althea. About her...  ...behavior. Do you think you can fix her up?
...People who have come to you with the faith that you know what you're doing... and that you are who you say you are?
Meat loaf, turkey quesadillas, or salad nicoise.
What do you want to know?
How ya doin', Ainge? Evenin', Lily.
It was insane here, man. 'Hadda call in the National Guard.  Then I did my laundry... watched 20/20.
Lily, I want you to meet Skip. Skip, Lily.
Here it is, some advice -- do the hard thing.
What's wrong with her?
What'd you want?
Finally, some common sense...
What do you mean?
I think you know what I mean.
Just who is here, can you tell me?
We'll take it slow. You'll never feel you can't handle it.
I'm not making any promises.
Maybe... but you're the one whose ass is dragging.
Sorry... I'm done.
You actually address yourself by name in your thoughts?  So you really think having two opposing ideas in your head does some kind of damage?
I don't know if I'm going to make it the whole way.
...who thinks there's nothing really wrong with me.
That's one way to put it.
It might've been more appropriate if we had followed a traditional approach to the doctor-patient relationship.
All right... I'm going to come right out and say this, because that's what your shrink is for, right, so you can tell him what's bothering you?
Okay...
Transference!
I am irate!
Will you think about it?
...but first, you have to tell me something...
...so he already had the tattoo that said, "Naomi Forever"... and now they're broken up, see, and he has to have it removed. But while the scar is still healing, or whatever you call it when you have a tattoo removed, he meets Chandra. And it's serious, immediate love. So in no time, he's gone from the most gorgeous model in the world to the most gorgeous actress in North America.
In maybe three or four issues.
Isn't she amazing? That is such a wicked look.
I want to have the session. I thought it would be cool if I could show you some of the things that interest me. But I guess you're not into it... which we already knew.
What happened today?
These appointments were not my idea, remember.
I don't know if I can quit. We're gonna try it together, like, you know, AA or something. And I made him give up his .22. No more sneaking around the hills with his fucking nut gun like some loony tune.
Would you like another beer?
Of course! That's exactly what I want.
Is that the question?
Skip, you're the head of the whole deal here. Are they busier than you?
You're concerned that maybe I can't be trusted with a secret.
No, Doc, a private secret! It's perverted, it's pitiful. What am I -- Dr. Frankenstein? Aren't you repulsed?
It wasn't the best situation.
Did you carry a gun?
English Lit.
Jeez, man. But you're good at it!
It's not going to be me. I'm giving it up.
Skip, you know that it's improper -- completely unethical -- for a licensed psychologist to carry on a romantic relationship with one of his patients?
I suppose your extended training was at an institution in that area?
Yes... your particular approach.
I never killed a priest before.
We saved him! Saved him before the creature could finish his work. Now leave, all of you, quickly, before he finishes you all.
And what ritual would that be?
Oh yes, of course.
Personally, I would like to surrender. Why can we not just surrender?
Now go find me a big stick.
Why do you like to fight so much?
Beni ya little stinkweed, where did you slink off to?
Oh yeah,... sorry bout that.  So who's this guy?
This is Prince Imhotep, High Priest of Osiris.
You put up with me, because I can read and write ancient Egyptian, decipher hieroglyphs and hieratic, and I'm the only person within a thousand miles who knows how to properly code and catalogue this library.
No women allowed.
Twenty.
What are you doing here?
Still angry that I kissed ya, huh?
There's something out there, you know, something under that sand.
Can you swim?
Oh my god,... it looks like, it looks like a sarcophagus.
Unlike your brother, Miss, you I don't get. You're a whole new brew.
You sure you outta be playin, around with that?
Forget it, we're out the door down the hall and gone.
According to that Book, once this creature has been reborn, his curse will spread, and as he grows in strength, so will his curse grow, infecting the people until the whole of the earth is destroyed.
Yeah? So? Is that my problem?
Two questions. Who the hell is Seti the First? And was he rich?
He was the last Pharaoh of the Old Kingdom, said to be the wealthiest Pharaoh of them all.
Do you really think he'll show up?
Sit down, O'Connell, sit down, we could use another good player.
Yes, awfully tempting, wasn't it?
Whoever's in here, sure wasn't getting out.
Ya know, ever since I met you, my luck has been for crap.
What?
Okay, now what the hell does this Horus guy look like?
I knew you'd come. I left that skylight open for you.
Except for one little thing.
Do I?
The Bowler? I remember him from when I was a kid. He was killed years ago.
But you're a superhero.
I know... My girlfriends all dumped me after I put on the mask. They thought I'd lost it.
It's me... Elizabeth.
How's your dad?
He's dead.
Doc, these are my friends. We're superheroes, and we need your help.
They always call the great ones nuts.
Thanks for reminding me which team I'm on.
Are you an actress?
Me too... I love this stupid old town. It's noisy. It's smelly. It's falling apart.
I've thought of leaving, going to Chicago or New York, but...
I just want to be a superhero.
At the Frankenstein Center.
So, let me get this straight. You have the power to become invisible.
So what else has Superman got?
But she still might call!
He's Lance Hunt! Just take off the glasses -- and it's him!
Nah.
Let's go.
Sounds good.
But... only when no one is looking.
So you're only invisible... to yourself?
So you're only invisible, when absolutely no one is looking at you?
We're superheroes.
We prefer to think of ourselves as unsung... I am the Blue Raja, Master of Silverware... 
It's on the television.
And why are you wearing that silly costume?
It is?
Definitely.
This is bad.
This looks like a job for Superman --
Be a Mohican.
Twenty years ago all the major hoodlums of this city were united into one great brotherhood of evil, and Casanova was their king.
It's time.
Through there!
But, since the fire, a completely new spirit has been aroused in the nation.  The French have become an army of criminals, against whom Russia must be avenged, against whom she is now prepared to fight to the death.
General Kutusov, I would like to call a meeting of my cabinet tomorrow morning and have you present this idea to them.  I think it has merit and is worthy of consideration.
And, what a delightful idea!
What do you have in mind?
Cavalry?
There are none here.
I must be honest with you.  I first approached three generals more senior than yourself, and they all very prudently sent excuses.
And who is defending Paris?
But did she have the best doctors? Wasn't there any chance at all to save her?
I have never heard an unkind word about her spoken.
Who is there?
To Joseph Bonaparte -- Dear Joseph, I have been informed by my wife of the cold and spiteful treatment she has been receiving at the hands of my family, since my departure.  I am also informed that you have refused to pay over to her any of the money I left with you expressly for this purpose.  Must you, too, take this opportunity during my absence to indulge the petty jealousies of the Bonaparte family?
General Bonaparte?
Was it he who assigned you to command the escort which accompanied Madame Bonaparte's coach?
Was the trip normal in every respect?
A glass of champagne, please.
When you eat him, may I have some?
Ah, my dear Francis, what a genuine pleasure it is to meet you at last.
The weather is terrible, isn't it, sir?
No, I'm only here on leave.  My regiment is at Valence.
Please, sir, come into bed or I shall die of a chill.
No... nothing at all.
It is time to clarify the situation. Everything is over between us.
Are you trying to insult me?
Ah, that is good.
Five minutes.
Five minutes.
I thought he would be seeing you before I would, and would give it to you.
I must have the breakdown now. Where is Berthier?
Nothing.  That's all I can say.
Look, Junot, you aren't going to leave this room until you explain yourself.
I didn't want to hurt you... All I wanted to do was to keep from hurting you.  I swear I didn't want to hurt you.
Yes.
I was in her maid's room at an inn we stopped at for the night, outside of Dijon.  It was an adjoining room to Madame Bonaparte's.
I wanted to kill him but Joseph convinced me it would be a mistake. He said people would say you hadn't the courage to deal with it yourself.
May I inform you, monsieur, that I am Major Fidon, official courier to the court of the Emperor Napoleon, on my way to our Embassy at St. Petersburg and, in accordance with the rules of the road, no one may overtake or pass me.
Does she deserve anything better?
I very seriously doubt it.  I don't think there is any possibility of making peace with England so long as she sees herself safe from invasion. That is why we must increase the pressure on her economy.  With Russia in the Continental Blockade, England must collapse.  More than 40% of her trade is with the Continent and Russia.
What you are talking about is a gamble on moderation -- when I gamble, I prefer to gamble on force.
Sire, you have only enemies in the court of St. Petersburg, and I fear outside your influence, Alexander will have another look at what he has agreed to.
What did you say his name was?
Come in.
On December 2, 1804, Napoleon was made Emperor of France.  He would later say:  "I found the crown lying in the gutter and I picked it up."
Anything you need.
I don't know!
Me, too.  You think they're in there?
Dude, dogs hate me.  I don't know why. Me and K-9's just don't get along.
Shut up.  I been trying to tell yo' ass that... Day-Day is my cousin.  They're right there in the back.
What's crackin'?
Yeah, that's me.  Just a little somethin' somethin' I picked up.
You straight?
I can't taste nothing.
That ain't the worst part.  Her little sister, Baby D.  She's the one that gets real physical.  But I got a restraining order on her, too.
Man, I don't think I can do this, Craig. I got the B-G's.
Karla.
You want us to give you a ride?
I hope you don't think I'm crazy, but I just had to come in here and show you I ain't scared of yo' punk ass brothers...and you wouldn't have be scared of 'em neither if you had a man like me in yo' life.
Most of it.  I just hate to see you in this situation.
Thanks for noticing.  It used ta be peaceful before they got out.  Took over the house and caused my mother's nervous breakdown.
Delivery!
What is it?
Here I come!
Hold up, Elroy, that's my boy.  Craig, what the hell wrong with you?  Where you been?
Bullshit!  I'll go postal in this mothafucka!
Look, Roach, I know you ain't never worked in a record shop before and you're a little excited.  But if Pinky catches you doing that X-Games shit off his counter top, we both getting fired.  You feel me?
I say we go over there and kick their asses.  I can take the little one.
What?!  What that mean?
Thanks for the help.
Uh...um...I mean uh, can we borrow a cup of sugar?
Hey, what's going on?
What about that ugly dog?
Lousy. And I have siesta hair. I'm thinking of canceling the speech.
What's he doing here?
Don't remind me.
Uh, yes..
Sorry.
I appreciate that.
I remember you...in the elevator.
Who did?
Can we go now?
Pay attention, Mr. Watson. Pay attention and your daughter won't be hurt.
Don't you threaten me.
All right, let's just...let's get security in on this.
I'm serious, honey. Don't get out of my sight, all right? I want you to stay right by me. Will you do that for me?
Will you promise me that?
No...kisses to you.
Keep it.
Something is going to happen. When it's over you'll know what I was talking about.
Please...
I don't know.
It's already done. I've already done it. You have to pay me now.
Goddamnit, you fuckin' bum, come here!
Oh, yes. I'll show you. I have much more colors at home.
Where are we going?
You got this under control?
Foreigners! Fuck!
What gives?
What do you figure he done with it?
You killed two men, Ben Harper.
How come you got that stickknife hid in your bed-blankets, Preacher?
That Sword has served me through many an evil time, Ben Harper.
Keep talkin', Preacher.
..."and I won't never tell about the money."
I been mindin' Pearl.
Leavin', boy?
And the Lord told that man --
Yes! Yes!
The Lord said, Take that money and throw it in the River!
See ye got two more peeps to your brood.
Ain't heard from Ralph since last Christmas. Don't matter -- I've got a new crop.  I'm a strong tree with branches for many birds. I'm good for something in this old world and I know it, too! We know that she will rout the Devil.
Walt!
What's wrong, Mother?
Is he hit pretty bad?
There's a little peach brandy -- maybe a sip?
Sure, but you was worried too, Mother; takin' off with never a word of goodbye. I even got to figurin' them gypsies busted in and done off with all three of 'em.
That feller's just achin' to settle down with some nice woman and make a home for himself.
If ever I saw a Sign from Heaven!
The boy worries me. It's silly, but it's like there was something still between him and his Dad.
The money, Icey.
I mind you said there was two.
Why, he told me what fine little lambs you and your sister both was.
-- and when we come back, we'll all be friends -- and share our fortunes together, John!
I thought I told you to keep your mouth shut --
You don't reckon I'd leave you.
Don't you believe me?
Mm-hm.
Yes; John's bad.
Naturally.
Can I have milk too?
No.
Pearl and John.
Get up, Willa.
Are you through praying?
Gracious, gracious! You are a good woman, Miz Cooper!
This man down at the Drugstore...
The Drugstore?
What'd you all talk about?
How long's this been going on?
Okay, good. She's asleep.
What happened? That needle sank like a rock.
You okay?
You ever read about the Balinese way of dreaming?
No.
They got a whole system they call 'dream skills'. So, if you have a nightmare, for instance like falling, right?
My dream.
Sure, okay, I'll be there. Now you just turn in and get some rest, sweetheart. Please. Deal?
Krueger.
Okay... You need anything, just call.
Bunch of us parents tracked him down after they let him go. Found him in an old boiler room, just like before. Saw him lying there in that caked red and yellow sweater he always wore, drunk an' asleep with his weird knives by his side...
No.
Nice to have a fire.
You feel better now, right?
No more fights?
When did you have a nightmare?
Thank you, Comrade, thank you.
They didn't let me. I am in disgrace. Last week at the performance of Carmen I played a sour note. The conductor got so excited he yelled, "There's sabotage in the string section!"
I haven't talked to anyone about Paris. I haven't said a word.
What was it like?
When you get up you put on a negligee, and then you change to a morning frock.
No, my dear, it is true. That's how they live in the other world. Here we dress to have our bodies covered... to keep warm....
Well, sometimes they're not completely covered but... they don't freeze.
Ninotchka, I wouldn't bring this up if we weren't such good friends.
What is it, Anna?
You know I told you that Pavlov and I are going to get married when he comes back from the maneuvers. Would it be asking too much...
Just for the honeymoon.
You must help us, Leon... if you don't win her over we're on our way to Siberia!
He's cutting our throat...
How are things in Moscow?
Which lawyer?
Comrade Buljanoff...
Do you spell Buljanoff with one or two f's?
Good old Razinin! Is he still alive? How does he manage?
We are not only serving good food, we are serving our country... we are making friends.
Nonsense. How can you fight the Reds and make yourself agreeable to the Whites if you don't keep up your strength.
Blue? Let's offset his mood. Find a striped one, and brighten it with a great blaze of tie.
Yes, General Savitzky?
Are they indeed? Thank you.
Certainly, Your Highness, this way please... Count d'Algout made the reservation this afternoon.
Comrades, why should we lie to each other? It's wonderful.
I don't want to go to the Hotel Terminus.
We can wait.
Well, I think it's getting late. Good night, Ninotchka.
Ninotchka, we are in the magic East, the country of Aladdin and His Lamp...
We don't want to be disturbed.
Yes, monsieur?
This is Comrade Kopalski.
That's even better.
Yes... a very slim one. I want to be fair. I don't deny that you might make out some kind of a case.
I am ashamed to put the picture of Lenin in a room like this.  Comrades, your telegram was received with great disfavor in Moscow.
Yes, Comrade.
I acted on your suggestion and got in touch with the Power and Light authorities. Whenever you want to visit their plants they are open to you.
I'm sorry, gentlemen. The other day I heard such a funny story...  It still makes me laugh. It is very funny.  I am sorry. Oh yes... about this injunction...
That's two weeks from Thursday...
Here's my passport.... Please give me a visa. I have to leave for Russia immediately.
Why should an aristocrat want to go to Russia?
The Grand Duchess Swana... active in the White Russian movement?
No visa.
You're going to force us... huh?
What for... why?
No.
Facing north... I'd hate to commit myself without my compass... Pardon me... are you an explorer?
Bad manners to point with your own... Here... the Eiffel Tower.
You are very sure of yourself, aren't you?
Yes, it is.
Good evening, comrade.  This man is horribly old. You should not make him work.
Not too big and not too small. What I'd call the typical room of an average man. Or shall we say a little above average. Now if there are any special aspects you wish to study I have nothing to conceal. Just look around. That's my desk. Those are my books, and here am I. Where shall we begin?
And what is your profession?
Your general appearance is not distasteful.
Your cornea is terrific. Tell me -- you're so expert on things -- can it be that I'm falling in love with you?
You don't have to do a thing. Chemically we are already quite sympathetic.
I'd love to.  Tsk, tsk, tsk.
I must go.
Let's forget that we ever met.
As a representative of Moscow...
It is out of the question. If you wish to approach me...
Just an old man. His memory is getting weak.
Oh, Ninotchka, who wants to talk business. If you win the suit, fine. If we win the suit, better. You do me an injustice.  When we went to my apartment did I have the slightest idea that you had any connection with this deal?
At what?
Ha! Ha! Now go back.
Leon, you know the jokes you told me a few days ago? I wake up in the middle of the night and laugh at them. Now, Leon that's wrong. I know they're not funny, they're silly. They're stupid. And still... I laugh... and when I look at Buljanoff and Iranoff and Kopalski I know they are scoundrels and I should hate them -- then I realize who made them like that, and instead of sending my report to Moscow I tear it up and go down and buy a ridiculous hat... and if this keeps on... am I too talkative?
How do you do?
Go on.
You must, darling.
Now, Ninotchka... please!
Don't tell them where we're going, sweetheart.
And we won't stretch up our arms...
Would that make you any happier?
But, Leon, I am only here for a few days.
It's really a wretched morning... wretched. I can't get myself right. I wanted to look mellow and I look brittle. My face doesn't compose well... all highlights... how can I dim myself down, Leon? Suggest something. I am so bored with this face. I wish I had someone else's face. Whose face would you have if you had your choice? Oh, well, I guess one gets the face one deserves.
Don't you find that restful?... Why didn't you come last night?
Oh, Leon!
I understand how you feel, but there is a limit to everything, particularly pride and dignity. They are willing to pay any price! They have a circulation of two million!
I just couldn't sleep. I got up and went back... and then got up again. These last few days... whew!
You just told me you hadn't seen her.
That bad?  Old or young?
Is this your new dress suit?
Am I interrupting?
I've some wonderful news for you, Leon. It's about Punchy... do you mind if I sit down?
This time, Swana -- just this once -- I must ask you to listen.
It must be serious, Swana. Not long ago I'd have considered such a statement rather juvenile and rather middle class. Now I can say it without stammering, without a blush. I'm in love, Swana.
Count d'Algout was for several years my personal representative and if it is necessary to sign any affidavit for him I'll be delighted.
Just in case they don't give you your visa to Russia I want you to know that I have signed a contract for my memoirs and rented a lovely little chteau in the Touraine, and if you feel the need of a change...
Go on.
May I have your bags, madame?
Does this include the products of the Far Eastern provinces?
It gives details which couldn't be invented. Naturally I want to verify it and that's why I need you.
How can I make myself clear... It is difficult to express but I'd rather not go to foreign countries any more. Please, Comrade... let me stay here... let me finish my work... I am in the rhythm of it now... I don't want to go away. I don't want to be sent into that foreign atmosphere again. It throws one out of gear.... Let me finish my work... I have concentrated everything in it... Please... don't make me go.
But, madame! If you don't think about food what do you think about?
It's just a place for workmen.
How do you do, my friend.
You did say it, sir.
Frankly, sir, it stinks.  I have no access.  I'm lucky Helms lets me have a staff.
That's Helms.  He's "sang froid," a world-class poker player.
Mr. President, Hunt wants more money. Another hundred-and-thirty thousand.
He says if he doesn't get it right away, he's going to blow us out of the water.  And he means it.  Ever since his wife died in the plane crash, he's been over the edge.
How much do you need?
We could get that.
He's right.  Maybe it's time to go to the hang-out route, John.  A full and thorough investigation ... We've cooperated with the FBI, we'll cooperate with the Senate.  What do we have to hide?
That's not the question, John.  The question is: Why is he paying?
Who's gonna tell Mitchell?
The "Old Man" plays politics harder than anybody else.
Mitchell?
Is it legal?  I mean has anyone ever done it before?
And?
He wants money.
It's more than that.  It could be more than that.  I want Hunt paid.
Excuse me ... Are you talking about recognizing China, Mr. President? That would cost us our strongest support.
No, you didn't, Bob.
I would personally enjoy doing that, sir.
Mr. Hoover was a realist.
There's no secrets here, Al.
Who?
It's totally out of context.  I was protecting the national security.  I never intended --
That's right ...
... you mentioned the "Bay of Pigs" several times.  Sooner or later they're going to want to know what that means.  They're going to want to know what was on that gap ...
Yes, you approved it, sir.
We've got to turn off the FBI.  You just go to the CIA, Bob, and tell Helms that Howard Hunt is blackmailing the President.  Tell him that Hunt and his Cuban friends know too damn much, and if he goes public, it would be a fiasco for the CIA.  He'll know what I'm talking about.
How is this national security?
This isn't a "moral" issue, Bob.  We have to keep our enemies at bay or our whole program is gonna go down the tubes.  The FBI is filled with people who are pissed that I put Gray in and not one of their own.  Vietnam, China, the Soviet Union: when you look at the big picture, Bob, you'll see we're doing a hell of a lotta good in this world.  Let's not screw it up with some shit-ass, third-rate burglary.
He wasn't protecting me.  He was putting me on notice.
... and we've got the economic guys at five.  The Dow lost another 16 points. They're going to want a decision on the budget.  Sir?  ... Are we holding the line on a balanced budget?
You know why they're turning on me? They're not serious about power, that's why.  They're playing with power.  They're forgetting the national interest.  In the old days, people knew how to hold power, how to set limits.  They wouldn't have torn this country apart over a third-rate burglary. All they care about now are their egos, looking good at cocktail parties ...
Please!  I'll never let you down again, Mother.  Never.  I promise.
It's meant to make us stronger.  Thou art stronger than Harold ... stronger than Arthur.  God has chosen thee to survive ...
Hey ... you'll be able to do it now.
And me? ...
My job, unpleasant sometimes, is to know what others don't want me to know.
No.
Edgar, think twice.  He works in the kitchen.
Not Joaquin, you idiot.  Nixon.  Did you hear what he said in Oregon? About me having too much power.
Winning?
You asked if you could count on my support ... As long as I can count on yours.
Well, you have CIA people all over the place.  Helms has seen to that.  Then there's Kissinger's staff. Kissinger himself, I believe, maybe the leaker.
Jesus, I'd like to book him into a psychiatrist's office.  He comes in here ranting and raving, dumping his crap all over the place ... Could you prove it, Edgar?
Why, you got a customer?
Howard ... What the hell?  What're you doing?
Personally I'd prefer a greyhound with a shot of speed.
That sonofabitch Kennedy is coming back down here tomorrow.  Dick, we're willing to put up a shitpot fulla money to get rid of him -- more money'n you ever dreamed of.
It's me or Wallace, Jack.  Wallace's third party is only going to help McGovern.  I need your support.
Mr. President, we are in a revolutionary situation.  We are under siege -- Black Panthers, Weathermen; The State Department under Rogers is leaking like a sieve.  And now this insignificant little shit Ellsberg publishing all the diplomatic secrets of this country will destroy our ability to conduct foreign policy.
Well, as you know, most of my staff have weighed in against this "incursion."  They believe it will fail to achieve anything fundamental militarily, and will result in crushing criticism domestically ...
Exactly, sir.  That is your historical contribution: to lead boldly in an era of limits.
That's triangular diplomacy, gentlemen.
Housecleaning?  It would be ugly, Henry, really ugly ...
But it must be done; your government is paralyzed.
... because people have got to know whether or not their President is a crook.  Well, I am not a crook.  I have never made a dime from public service ...
That was Mr. Kennedy.
I don't know.  He made me see the stars ...
Mr. Chairman, there is an old saying: The enemy of my enemy is my friend.
Talks all day, too!  How the hell can you put up with her, John?
You need her, Dick -- in '60 she was worth five, six million votes.
They were throwing rocks, John, just rocks.  They don't think I feel ... but I feel too much sometimes.  I just can't let a whole policy get dominated by our sentimentality.
You're doing the right thing, Dick ... don't let 'em shake you.
Oh, I like satin, I like pink ...
Elvis I like, too.
Compassionate.  Grateful.
What do you mean?  We worked for it. We earned it.  It's ours.
He doesn't want me at the funeral.
This.  Above all.
Anything.
Are you okay?
Why don't we go down to Key Biscayne together?  Just the two of us.
Because ... I have to relax.
I don't need that, Buddy.  I'm not Jack Kennedy.
No, you're not.  So stop comparing yourself to him.  You have no reason to ... You have everything you ever wanted. You've earned it.  Why can't you just enjoy it?
I'm not scared, Buddy.  You don't understand.  They're playing for keeps, Buddy.  The press, the kids, the liberals -- they're out there, trying to figure out how to tear me down.
No, I don't.  I'm not Jack ...
Howya doin'!  New York treating you okay?  I'm sorry I haven't been able to see you at all--
Won or lost?
What?
How'd you know I was here.
Want a cup?
What would you a done if he'd been released?
I'm kindly surprised to hear you say that.
Yes, you've circled round.
I'm... discouraged.
Uh-huh.
No I ain't.
These people will kill him, Carla Jean. They won't quit.
Why you tellin' me that, Sheriff?
Who's Charlie Walser. Oh! Well, I, uh... True story? I couldn't swear to ever detail but... it's certainly true that it is a story.
Yes ma'am, I do.
I know this truck. Belongs to a feller named Moss.
So when was he here?
I'm goin' to try and keep from it as much as I can.
...What is it that Torbert says? About truth and justice?
We dedicate ourselves daily anew. Something like that.
That don't make sense. You gave your word to my husband to kill me?
Your husband had the opportunity to remove you from harm's way. Instead, he used you to try to save himself.
Just keep it up.
Fine. I don't wanna know. I don't even wanna know where you been all day.
Not we, you. Stay with your mother.
Llewelyn?
I don't know, I had the sheriff here from Terrell County --
I know something better.
I do know to a certainty. And you know what's going to happen now. You should admit your situation. There would be more dignity in it.
Where does he work?
What's this about?
Airport.
You know she won't be there.
Didn't mean nothin'.
...I'd say around nine-thirty. Somewhere around nine-thirty.
Yes I do.
You married into it.
...What's the most you've ever lost on a coin toss?
Call it.
Yes.
No.
...Don't put it in your pocket.
You on all night?
Okay.
...I'm wondering...
...An attempt at humor, I suppose.
No, one forty-two.
What else then?
I know what it is. He won't find me again.
Yes.
Pot metal?
No sir.
No sir.
No sir. I'm a veteran.
No... Friends from the diner maybe?
BETTY, I NEED TO TALK TO YOU... IN PERSON! WHERE'RE YOU AT?
Why you always gotta embarrass me? I been eating lunch with you since grade school and you always gotta embarrass me!
...plenty
Ahh, what'd you do now... fall off your bike again?
...you are so goddamn weird.  Oh, and by the way, get the hell outta here!
You bet I did. I got a squad car on the way to the reservation right now.
Seems she was pretty familiar with 'ol Del. On a regular basis, if you get my drift...
A woman can write a check.
We think we know where Betty is.
Yeah? Well, she called Sue Ann yesterday from Arizona.
Just shut up a second and listen... That, uh... that bar in Arizona? Where you said Betty was?
We need ammo... Go check his jacket, I'll cover you.
I'm not going out there! Let's wait for the real police...
Do you know why I'm here?
You really... didn't have anything to do with what Del was doing, did you?
Umm, I don't think that...
I wrote that when I was twelve... where'd you get that?!
Wait, Betty... you still haven't answered me.
All the time...
Betty, honey, listen to me. A man came by from Mutual Life Insurance. He says you've got money comin' to you from Del's policy.  Del's life insurance policy -- Are you with me?
Do what?
Carleton School of Nursing. Two semesters, but Del made me give it up...
For Mother's Day, I used all my allowance that I'd been saving to take my mother to Kansas City. We got our nails done and had lunch at "Skies," a restaurant at the top of a building from where you can see the whole city. It was the last outing we took together. She died the following year.
I just want everything to be perfect between us.
Thanks. But I'd like to hear what you're feeling...
Well, I don't know what you had in mind, but I hope you're happy. I put myself on the line for you, my reputation, and you're making me look like an idiot.
I'm sorry... Oh my gosh, are you George McCord?!
You're doing this now? After all the... are you sick? Are you going to kill me now?
I have... did it sound that bad?
Mmm-hmm. Listen, I forgive you, Mr. McCord...
No, I do not want any goddamn... what was all that shit on the phone about the new Buicks?
I took the blue Corsica, Del. Relax.
Just knock it off, 'kay? Anyhow, they're 97's, they're not even new.
Well, are you gonna answer me? What'd you come here for?
That's right. So, if you know it, why are you in trouble?
Thanks, Roy, you're sweet... a big liar, but sweet. I liked your editorial this morning...
Hey, Betty. Are you okay?
What're you doing here, Roy?
Roy! What are you doing here?
I'm getting back with my ex-fianc. He proposed to me right around here, so I guess this is just sort of a sentimental stop...
Nice move. Cedars Sinai?
She called you 'George,' George.
ARE YOU CRAZY?!! STOP IT!!!
It's lovely... I really like your aquarium.
You made it! Hey, that looks great on you. 'S classy...  So, how'd it go today? You find him?
You know, the more I think about it, this really isn't David's kind of place.
Had. She died in a car accident last year. She was decapitated.
God, that's awful!
It may not have been an accident. They never did find her head...
Her 'head'?! You're making this up...
What? Where was he?!
I helped you because I'm an idiot! Ask my mother, I love it when people take advantage of me! I TRUSTED YOU!! I THOUGHT HE WAS REAL!
Were you with him this whole time?
Oh, God! You scared me! Yes...
Was it a huge place? With a view of the whole world?
Where are you going?
...you can have the best damn running backs in the world, somebody's still gotta block for 'em.
If you ate at the Tip Top you did.
I didn't think so. So, give me an example of a stupid person doing a stupid thing. Not being stupid, you're equipped to recognize it.
Let's see... around here that would be Kiowa, Kickapoo or Osage, if I'm not mistaken.
I... I don't know...
Well, my idea of stupid is very different from yours.  So here's how this is gonna work. Would you take your socks off, please?
No, that's ignorant. They just don't know any better.
You told me how to do it!
I didn't. You gave me a look!
That one look you got! I thought you were done, so I took him out...
We can live with that.
What the hell was that, another statement?
Joyce was screwing Del.
I'd say that about torches her credibility, wouldn't you?
It's a very moving experience, trust me.
I'm not telling.
What?
Well... I think I saw her soul.
I dunno, that lady sounded pretty sure...
Wait, wait, wait a minute... that doesn't make sense.
I never said that I believed...
What do your instincts tell you to do now, kid?
No... if we don't finish this job, how are we gonna look at ourselves in the mirror? This is it for me, Wesley, she's the last one. My instinct says I gotta see this through with her, and if there's one thing I've tried to teach you here --
It's to follow my instincts. And my instincts say get the fuck out of Dodge.
Very graceful. Perfect form.
Thank you for your cooperation.  Just one more thing... did she ever talk about getting rich?
Right, uhh... I feel terrible about this, we have a prior engagement at another party.  But... I'd be honored if you'd come.
I don't know, George...
All right, everybody! That's ten minutes!
You fucked it up. Who wouldn't freeze in those circumstances? And I don't care what her problems are. She wouldn't be the first one in that cast with problems. We have nothing to lose by making her an offer.
Because it ain't natural, young man.
No, about... Are you talking about Duane Cooley?
So how's it going with your new roomie? What's her name?
Betty. It's O.K. except I'm worn out. We spent all weekend looking for her doctor-boy. How can a big time heart guy leave no trace of himself?
So tell her to settle for the old one in Orange County.
David Ravell.
I flatter myself that such is the case; in my line of work it's plumb necessary. The one thing you don't want is air in the conversation.
You got light fingers, Everett. Gopher?
But there were witnesses, saw us redeemed!
Damn! We gotta skedaddle!
Now wuddya suppose is eatin' George?
Whuhh...
What on earth is goin' on here! What's got into you, Delmar!
...I'm not sure that's Pete.
'N turned into a frog -
We'll go fetch it with ya, Everett.
A miracle! It was a miracle!
What's his name again?
Well now, I don't believe assa property scription.
Have him join us, run our campaign 'stead a that pencil-neck's.
All's well that ends well, as the poet says.
The hell it ain't square one! Ain't no one gonna pick up three filthy unshaved hitchhikers, and one of 'em a know-it-all that can't keep his trap shut!
...Nah, that ain't right... I'm thinkin' of...
I couldn't wait two weeks! She's gettin' married tomorra!
Two weeks! That don't do me no good!
Well sir, my name is Jordan Rivers and these here are the Soggy Bottom Boys outta Cottonelia Mississippi- Songs of Salvation to Salve the Soul. We hear you pay good money to sing into a can.
Hot damn, we gotta find those boys! Sign 'em to a big fat contract! Hell's bells, Mr. Lunn, if we don't the goddamn competition will!
She's at the five and dime.
Hey, honey, look at this! My son! Isn't he beautiful?  You should've called!
Great ass.
Back east in Newport, Rhode Island, they call 'em the Fall River Debs. In Pensacola, the Mobile Debs. In Norfolk --
Okay, I wrote those things... and yeah, I had big thoughts of getting together with your mom... but when she hit me with being pregnant, I saw who she was. I'd had quiff lay that shit on me before!
Esther, do you think she's using...  ...birth control?
Stop eyeballing me, mister! I've looked through your file and done a little checking, and I know it all. I know about your mother. I know your old man's an alcoholic and a whore chaser.  Life sure has dealt you some shitty cards! Hasn't it, Mayo?
Mayo, the rest of your class knows about candidate Worley, and we're all sorry.
I'm busy, Mayo. It'll have to wait.
I called you Sarge.
No, sir!
Oklahoma City, Oklahoma.
Only two things come out of Oklahoma, steers and queers. Which one are you, boy? I don't see any horns so you must be a queer.
What did you call me, Mayo?
I know why most of you are here. We're not stupid. But before you get to sell what we teach you over at United Airlines, you gotta give the Navy six years of your life, Sweet Pea. Lot of things can happen in six year. Another war could come up in six years. If you're too peaceful a person to dump napalm on an enemy village where there might be women and children, I'm gonna find that out. Understand?
How late?
Exactly how late are you, Lynette?
What're you doing out of uniform, Sid? You don't want to get in trouble.
Sid, there's no baby.
Far fucking out! I've been wanting to meet one of the Blue Angels since I can remember.
Hurry, Lynette. It's almost midnight.
Paula, how far would you go to catch Zack?
Lynette, just keep your mouth shut until we get to the motel. Will you do that for me, please.
Hey, what kind of name is Pokrifki?
Yeah? Why're you here?
Do you go to school?
I don't know who you think you're talking to! I ain't some whore you brought here! I've been trying to be your friend and you treat me like shit!
God.
What would you do differently?
I'll try, but this week we go into survival training, so I can't make any promises.  Well, thanks again for dinner. Thank your mom again for me, will you?
What's the matter, Sweet Pea. Foley finally starting to get to you?
Thanks for covering for me.
But it would still be my kid. That's the point.
I don't get it! He's the best candidate in our class! Ask anyone! The best student! The best leader! The best friend to everybody! Couldn't you bend your goddamn standards just a little?
What?
You're welcome.
What if she called the cops?
God.
The fuck did you do that for?!
I can't...
She's gonna handle it.
Let me fucking finish this so we can get out of here.
This was your department, Junior.
Unless Daddy comes back later.
Forty-five minutes.  That's all you said you need.  That's like nothing.
I met him at the tables, same as you.  And frankly, I'm grateful we have a little muscle right about now.
Not if we keep 'em here.  You can't kidnap somebody in their own house. It's just breaking and entering, unless we take 'em someplace.  Or something like that, I'm pretty sure.
Shut up.
I'm afraid to let you think, Junior. Things get worse when you think.  Oh, that's gonna help.
They're gonna die in there!
She's never coming out.
Everything okay?
Somebody called you?
Your husband says you said "There are three..." right before you got cut off.
That's highly inappropriate.
Wait a minute, wait a minute.  We can still handle this.  Can we still handle this?
No cars.  Feet are faster.
I don't think so, but I love her album.
Old Bernie didn't miss a trick with this room, did he?
478...
What do we do?
Oh, please.
He'll do something.
Uh uh.
He'll know we're in trouble.  He heard me, I said "There are three..."
Okay, listen, honey, you went double digit here, you must have been shooting out adrenaline like crazy, we gotta bring your blood sugar back up, okay?  Can you hear me?
Hey, she's still a smart ass, excellent sign.  Did you see any sugar in here?  Any candy bars, anything sweet?
Hey, quit apologizing, you're starting to sound like Grandma. You're not gonna have an attack. Okay?
Uhh... I with it sister but...
Okay now, er, Huey, so what's your telephone number?
What? We're the leadership, you and me. There ain't enough of us to...
No. I've seen Black men handing out bags of food. Having meetings. Patrolling the neighborhood. Having more meetings. They ain't...
Why didn't you tell us about the party you boys were planning at the capitol?
Hey... what the hell you doing?
PE? What? You guys doing gym class?
Naw... They're kids mostly. Idealists. They actually think they're for real.
Are you finished?
These are memos from the commissioner, the mayor and Hoover himself, putting the Black Panthers and their subversive activities under the full jurisdiction of the Bureau.
Rodgers... this is no good...
Yeah, but aligning with white organizations. I'm not sure now's the time.
Yes sir I was.
Well, then we're going to take that power away from those bastards.
Shit, nothing but Paper Panthers.
Huey man I got to talk with you...
That's right. We'd be proud to provide as escort for Malcolm's widow. How many men you got?
And you're gonna do just that. But I'll tell you what to feed the pig. You alright with this?
I saw... but...
Huh?
You supposed to be a wounded vet, Motherfucka. What you do in 'Nam anyway, shoot gooks or shoot hoops?
Judge man. Watch yourself. Sabu's got juice now.
You don't look alright.
Yeah.
Next time we'll bring more blankets.
Maybe we'll be lucky this winter and have just rain, no snow.
You don't know him very well, do you?
I know him well enough?
You're surrendering.
Yes, sir.
First Virginia Regulars under Colonel Hamilton.
Please forgive me for keeping you waiting.
Thank you, Colonel... I'm afraid I don't know your name.
Colonel will do.
I'm familiar with how a formal negotiation is handled.
Sir?
I've been doing this for two years. I'm the best scout in the Continental Army, the best horseman, the best shot, the best scavenger and I know every deer path and swamp trail between here and Charleston.
And, Corporal...  ... be careful.
Lord Cornwallis is brilliant.  His weakness is that he knows it.
Gabriel?  Are you asleep?
That the French and Cherokees captured the fort and when you retook it, you took revenge on them for what they did during the occupation.
Please.
Those of us who call ourselves Patriots are not seeking to give birth to an American nation, but to protect one that already exists.  It was born a hundred-and-seventy years ago at Jamestown, Virginia and has grown stronger and more mature with every generation reared and with every crop sown and harvested.  We are a nation and our rights as citizens of that nation are threatened by a tyrant three thousand miles away.
You were an Englishman then...
... time, royal succession, regicide, bribery...
One of yours?
Green Dragoons came to my home, killed my son, Thomas.  It was Tarleton himself.
We saw.
Who's in command?
Long time.
Not me, you.  I'm going north with every Continental regular I can find to reinforce Washington or he won't last six weeks.
You expect Cornwallis to be held here by militia?
Goodbye, Francis.
Thank you.
We could go stay at Aunt Charlotte's farm.  She's to the west.
No, he won't.  There are two things you need to know about Cornwallis. First, he is a very proud man, He would rather risk defeat than share a victory.  If you give him what he thinks is an out, he'll take it.
Seventeen.
Father?
Well...I guess not.
In the end he's gonna croak, isn't he?
Good God! Where'd you hear that?
Sure, carnation. Like in that movie you rented, Audrey Rose.
I think we go on. I'm not sure what happens after we die, but yeah-- I have faith in that.
Then why do I have to go to bed?
Jud Crandall. I live just across the road.
Not yet...how much further is it?
I'm sorry. At least it don't look like he suffered.
No need to apologize.
Jud, this is crazy. It's going to be almost dark before we get back.
What say, Louis?
Nothing.  Do we plant him on the outer circle or start a new one?
What do you mean?
What are those for?
But--
I most generally don't start before noon, but this looks like an exception.
Your father-in-law packs a wallop, for an old guy. He and his wife gone back to Chicago?
No...squatting out there at the Holiday Inn like a couple of vultures. He really thinks Rachel's going to go back with them. Her and Ellie.
Please, I want to wake up. Leave me alone. It's not my fault you died; you were as good as dead when they brought you in--
Leave me alone!
The door must not be opened. The barrier must not be crossed.
Timmy Baterman. That was wrong.
I just said--
I heard you tonight.
You've got one shot -- and we can't die.
Allow me the humor of listening to your terms.
Blast you!  I'll throw you in prison.
That fool woman took it.  You be careful around her, Jack -- she's pretty enough, she'll steal your heart -- but pure evil inside.
No, I really think I do.
Do you believe him?
I am disinclined to acquiesce to your request.  Means 'No.'
Because it's what you're searching for.  You've been searching for it for years.  I recognize this ship. I saw it eight years ago, when we made the crossing from England.
Oh, there would be no sense in killing you, Miss Turner.
What?
That would hardly be proper.
To keep it away from them?  No pirate would sail to London, for fear of Execution Dock.
If I had known --
I can't believe he would make such a sacrifice for us.
Elizabeth, I think it doesn't matter that we are of a different class --
Captain Sparrow!  We have to get off this island -- immediately!
So that's it?  That's the secret grand adventure of the infamous Jack Sparrow?  You spent three days on the beach drinking rum?
Now I must hear this song.  An authentic pirate song.  Have at it.
He might delay the rescue ... and that would be too late.
Make it last, then.  Now, what's the nature of this venture of yours?
First -- have you found me a crew?
Oh, there's a hard tale, Jack. Most of the decent pirates in town won't sail with you -- seem to think you're a jinx.
Aye, and that's why I know where it's going to be, and that's why I know what Barbossa is up to.  All I need is a crew.
How did you get off the island?
What?  He never told me that.
Raise the sails.
The wind is quarter from astern ... by the time we're underway, we'll never catch them.
This dock is off-limits to civilians.
No ... somone has to make sure this dock stays off-limits to civilians.
Taking stock: you've got a pistol with only one shot, a compass that doesn't point north ... and no ship.  You are without a doubt the worst pirate I have ever heard of.
I don't like the situation, Mister Sparrow.  The island is riddled with caves.  I will not put my men at a disadvantage.
They left me stranded.  Twice. What have you got to lose?
You cheated.
Because you're a pirate.
And you want to turn pirate yourself?
Come aboard.
'Bootstrap?'
It's not true my father was a pirate.
My father did not think of my mother -- his family -- as a burden.
Tortuga?
Depends.
There's no *real* ship as can match the Interceptor.
You haven't seen it.
... No.
Please.
Please, O'Brien, don't do this to me!  I'll give you anything you want!
You can't do this!  You owe me, O'Brien.  I made you plastic!  I made you!
She let it escape because she wants me to die.
Now, Icky, I don't need you winding yourself up.  I need you focused and in control.
A containment crew is going to attract a lot of attention.
Why are there two ottomans?
Yes.  Yes, of course it is.
Poppy, please --
Did you feel that?
Did I?  I've been waiting for that for years.
Well, yes.  The replicators are not as active at low temperatures.
It'll be better for us if he simply disappears.  The gardener will know what to do.
You don't want this.
Why don't you just put this in your pocket so when you see a garbage can you can put it where it belongs.
Oh no, no, no.  No can do.  You enjoyed a tasty beverage and thus this receptacle becomes your responsibility and I don't care if it's a Styrofoam cup or the Exxon Valdez!  You've got to learn to take responsibility!
What?  Oh, I'm sorry, Nigel.  I was just thinking...
Yeah.  I knew him when I was still in school.
They also tried using viral R.N.A. as the bonding element.
What did security say?
You were never invited to my house.
I don't believe this is happening...
Nigel, can't you see he's using you?
Of course he is, but at least there isn't a security guard outside my door.
Sir, please try to hold still.
Somebody has to.
It already is.
Well, it was good to see you, Daniel, but I have to be going.
What happened to it?
You don't know?
But you've polymerized single-celled bacteria and the fruit flies, I know you have.
Yes.
Oh no, no, no!  You've got to be able to fix me!  Please, Susan, tell me you can make me normal again!
The nanobot combined your molecules with the plastic molecules in the white assembler fluid, so that on a molecular level you now have more in common with a Good Year tire than a human being.
Lungs sound fine.  You didn't have any pre-existing physical conditions, did you?  Allergies? Infections?
You have no one to blame but yourself.
Victim my ass!  You stole my security key and used it to break into my lab to do who knows what kind of damage!  Maybe this is the end of the story and you finally got what you deserved!
This is what I deserve for trying to protect the world from a madman and his mercenary physicists?
I want you to know that I really appreciate you helping me.
Oh no.  They're trying to blame you for the accident.  That means they must not have been able to control the replicators.
I didn't know what was going to happen.  I was just so worried something was going to happen to you.
Oh no!  Argon!  We have to stop him before he uses the nanobot!  We have to get the nanobot!
Where is it?
Run, Daniel!  Get out of here!
Daniel, just forget Argon.  Let's get out of here.  We'll find another way to stop the waste.
I have to!
Oh yes you are!
It might be paranoia, but I've never lost my keycard before.
To make a gentleman out of a tramp?
I think I better go, Stew.
What do you want?
I don't know how to thank you. Mother'll be so grateful - she'll probably want to kiss you.
Your mother will want to kiss me? Give me back my letters.  That's the breaks I get. It's the mothers that are always grateful to me.  Here.
Say, you could do anything with me you wanted to. Putty - just putty, that's me.  Now getting back to those eyes of yours - would you mind if I kind of got closer so I could see them?
None of your ideas can be goofy, Stew, if they concern me.
A little? Sure, I'll be right up.  He's all right. I like him.
Your place?
Oh darling, of course it would. If it isn't - there are six rooms and two baths - but if that isn't enough, Mother will give us the blue room too, I think.
You wear them of course, silly.
Oh, yes you will my dear - oh, yes you will my dear - you'll wear garters and you'll like it too!
Look out for my lipstick, Stewart.
Now wait a minute. Aren't you being a little unreasonable?
You've done nothing but watch me - watch me! - ever since I've been here. Treated me like a thug, watched me like a hawk, mistrusted me. Every time I leave the house, that Jane  goes out and counts the silverware.
Fine!  I don't blame her. I know I'm out of my own crowd. I should have had better sense in the beginning. But I'll stay in my own backyard from now on.
Mother, I promise you that he won't be a reporter much longer. Once I get him away from that atmosphere and get him away from a man named Gallagher
I was so worried for fear he'd knock over a vase or something. I must have acted like an idiot.  What does it say about the reception last night?
Stop it. Anne. You're behaving like the person you're married to.
Ah-ah-ah!
a beautiful pair of shoulders! But listen now, as a favor, will you please make it snappy, Laughing Waters,[14] and tell Stew Smith I gotta see him because if you don't my whole family's going to die.
Fine. Have a seat.
I bring a message from Garcia.
Yeah. The boss sent me over to offer you a job. He wants you to write a daily column on the Tribune.
Now listen, we've got a tip that the Schuyler family has finally made a deal with that chorus dame.
All right. Give me a voucher for expenses.
What do I care about your mother- in-law! You're still working for this paper, aren't you! Or are you?
Yes, sir.
You heard me. A bird in a gilded cage.
Yeah, live on my salary - that is, until I finish writing my play.
No!
Dawson, sir.
Quite so. Quite.
That's a lovely dress.
No, no! Maybe we could interest you in some well done butterflies, or perhaps some slightly fried pansies, or better still, some stuffed shirts. And guaranteed every one of them will give you a good stiff pain in the neck.
Stewart, have you ever been to Old Madrid?
What do you know about Conrad?
And there's her mother - and what a character that old dame would make with her double-strength - and that lawyer friend of theirs - he'd make a great villain - and there's you!
What other girl?
But that's ridiculous! You can't make a sudden change like that.
No.
Rumors? Rumors? Since when is a breach-of-promise case a rumor?
I suppose you know why I came?
Oh, Smythe, some bicarbonate of soda, quick - double strength. I know those news mongrels[3] will upset me.
Smythe, you've been drinking.
About what? Your marriage to Anne!
Stop calling me Mother!
Well, if I couldn't be a good putterer, I wouldn't want to putter. But why? What makes you think I couldn't be a good putterer?
Yes.
Have you got any make up?
Thank you.
Thanks ... I love you.
Oh, hi ...
What?
What is that?
All night?
Sure you are.
What's all the commotion? Where's the cat?
... And you always seemed so smart and everything. Like that report you did on "Our Town Hall." Gosh. I didn't know what I'd talk to you about.
Oh yeah ... Gorgeous.
... Why?
What's the matter?
What'll it be?
"Changes."  And it's not just the fire or big stuff like that. It's little things.  Did you hear about Bill Miller?
Bud Parker and William Johnson, you have been charged with desecration of a public building and the intentional use of prohibited paint colors in violation of the Pleasantville Code of Conduct and laws of common decency. Do you admit that on the night of May 1, you did consciously and willfully apply the following FORBIDDEN colors to the Pleasantville Town Hall:  Red, Pink, Vermillion, Puce, Chartreuse, Umber, Blue, Aqua, Ox Blood, Green, Peach, Crimson, Yellow, Olive and Magenta.
BECAUSE I WILL NOT ALLOW YOU TO TURN THIS COURTROOM INTO A CIRCUS!
Oh sure it is.
What's outside of Pleasantville?
Hear your Dad got a new car.
Green.
The other one?
What did you do?
Why can't we just EXPLAIN IT?
What?
They don't notice that kind of thing.
He-llo? I've got like three pounds of underwire here ...
Couple of cheeseburgers and two cherry cokes.  If you need anything, I'll be right over there.
You don't understand. You're messing with their UNIVERSE.
They're happy like this.
Um ... They like wanna ask you a question ... I didn't know how to handle it. So ...
... Yeah.
Seemed kinda sexy. Look. I read 35 pages.
Well--did she really like me or were you just making that up.
How come I'm still in black and white?
Are you sure?
This thing works. We could go home right now.
You got the admissions letter.
Keeps going ...
I picked them myself. They grow wild up here.  Mmm. So sweet.
It's beautiful. Where'd you get it?
You're gonna forget about me.
McGinty's.
Look--we appreciate it. We really do. We just--we want to go home now.
So even though I can't make any promises, well--I figured if you asked me real nice--I might just be willing to talk about it again.
I can't.
Why don't you just take me back without it?
I'm going on trial tomorrow?
You know how when we close up, I close the register, then you lower the shades, then I turn out the lights, then we both lock the doors.
There aren't any cheeseburgers.
Look. I thought we talked about this, I thought we said ...
Forget about that!
Oh, hi.
Gosh, I loved that show. Watched it for years.
Well, I can't talk though --
You just fucking said "chat," that is so -- what are you now? "chat." I'm just calling to make sure you show up at this party tonight.
I'm looking at your advertisement for the airline promotion and giveaway?
It's extension 215 if you want to try me back.
I'm trying to be your friend.
You look nervous.
Seriously, though: We're going to eat, I said.
Did you ask Walter to get you a shrink?  Barry, did you ask Walter to get you a shrink? What's wrong with you? Are you ok?
Why's it here?
What? Tell me why you wanna know --
Nothing.
I'm fine. Who is this?
Uhhh...I am sooo tired...I stayed up too late last night, what about you, when did you go to sleep?
Not very late.
Remember last night I was talking to you and I was telling you about my apartment, my rent -- ?  Do you remember?
Yes.
Like seven-fifty. Seven hundred fifty?
I thought they opened at seven.  If I left my car would it be ok?
Thank you.
Hi.
Do you remember me, I left my car, yesterday.
Business is good, you're busy?
I saw a picture of you.
No. I'm the exact opposite --
I'm going to go and eat tomorrow night do you want to go with me?
You see if you spent $3,000 dollars on pudding you could earn over one million frequent flyer miles.
....No....
I'm sorry. I thought you said --
I thought you said you bought all that pudding --
Yes.
Did you pick it up from the street?
I'll be around and back in town in a few days --
You don't think you'll go --
This is Barry.
Yeah.
That was good.
Ok.
I don't, no matter what my sisters say, ok?
Have a good trip.
Do you want to meet me and talk about this stuff?
It's so nice.
Can I come home with you when we get there?
I'm fine are you ok?
Right. Alright, lemme call you first thing tomorrow, I'm gonna run the numbers, see what's what and I'll give you a call back --
It's fine. I can just get you at your office.
Sir, I have no way of proving that you demolished the bathroom --
Yes it is.
And your billing address and the name as it appears on the card?
.....1274 Moorpark. Sherman Oaks, California. #4. 91403.
What's that for?
337-09-9876. But I don't want anyone to know my name.
Can we agree that that is that?
Hi Walter.
How's business?
No, no, no, no, no. What do you mean? It doesn't state anywhere about six to eight weeks.
Yes I'm fine.
It's not a piano. LANCE! LANCE! MAKE SURE THAT YOU CALL THAT GUY IN TOLEDO.
I'm going to go to Hawaii but you can't tell my sisters that.
Yes. Sorry.
Are you going to the party tonight?
Yes I am.
Right now, you're doing nothing?
I won't.
I know.
Ok.
Yes you do. We were calling you Gay Boy and you got so mad....
When can you leave?
It's....whatever....that's not cool.
Nothing.
He's wearing a suit again, I don't know why he's wearing a suit, he doesn't usually dress like that --
It's ok, it's alright. I'll come right back, I'll just go pay for my car.
They need to see the new 484's to make sure it works with their OC....
Ok.
It's remarkable, Doctor. The patients are so subdued; so docile.
For fuck's sake, who else would it be? The witching hour's arrived; you've alerted the others, yes?
At your service, Count.
"To seal the wound, he took a poker from the fire --"
I was wrong to free him, but so are you -- for taking all his treasures -- his quills and his ink --
Don't say that; reading's my salvation.
I must grant him his last rites.
Have you truly read the book in question? Or did you run -- straightaway -- to the dog-eared pages?
One more trick like this, and I'll be forced to revoke all your liberties!
Put yourself in my place. I've your fellow patients to consider. If Charenton falls, they've no place to go. No manner in which to clothe or feed themselves --
Fuck 'em! They're half-wits and pinheads. Let 'em die on the streets, as Nature intended.
If you only mean to dupe me again --
I'll die of loneliness! I've no company but the characters I create --
His rug.
What on earth would that require?
Don't confuse one organ with another --
Go to hell!
Who's to say I did not?
Was it impotence?
You're a man of Science; I'm a man of God. Charenton stands to profit from us both, I'm certain.
He's made a great success of our Little Theater; there's seldom an empty seat. Not to mention its therapeutic value.
And he's never once attempted escape?
Well...?
And place my reputation at stake?
It's a weak man who tests his mettle on the backs of children --
And my own.
Poorly.
Quite.
At last she arrives, my hard-won bride! Hurry, my child, and scurry inside. There you'll find such treasures await you; Marzipan and meringue to sate you!
I tremble with fear! You're bound to pound the quivering lips of my Venus mound!
What of my lips, will you soil them too? When you've broken every other taboo?
I'm hungry for a proper visit.
Is it terribly erotic?
They've taken your clothes?
Yes! You shall. Of course you shall --
...yes, I've got that bit...
You'd do that, rather than forsake our love?
You're aware, are you not, that it costs a great deal to house your husband at Charenton...
I pay his stipend every month, far more dutifully than I should.
It's tainted money, Doctor.
To flaunt your deviance in public? Upon a stage?
No, when I was but a tender lad--
Of being found out. Of not being a genius
Oh, but haven't you heard? I'm the Boy Wonder. I've been a genius since the moment I was born.
And attractive in a hammy sort of way.
Intimately. For every sin you have placed on my head I could give you a hundred others. I have been swimming in blood my entire life. But I retain a belief, perhaps you will think it old fashioned, undoubtedly you will, but I believe that private lives should not be public property.
Quite. And this is why I came to visit. Have you heard about this CITIZEN KANE picture?
Uh-hub.
See what you can do about this CITIZEN KANE picture, won't you?
Goddamn it. I gotta have some kinda life!
The Journal was pretty harsh to Roosevelt today.
Bought and p-p-paid for. Just like one of his goddamn statues. Well at least in the movie he married her!
There's nothing to explain
I will not defend my life to you--
You don't have any money left, okay?! That's the truth. I don't wanna say it, nobody else will say it, but it's the truth. You spent it all. You can't buy the Tribune in Chicago -- you can't buy ^ g-g- goddamn thing. Now you better face up to it--
You are being typically theatrical, Marion. I need the Tribune to--
Not for me.
Thank you for your time
Tome it's a question of truth and illusion. Don't you get tired of the errant falsity in motion pictures?
Louella, hello, I was just fixing a drink, would you like--?
Oh for God's sake, Louella-
All right! Enough! I've heard this from Schaefer and RKO. I've heard it from everyone--
Telling stories.
Nope.
Like a bug.
This better be good
How long have we spent casting our minds about the world when the answer to our prayers was right here under our noses -- every single day in the newspapers and on the radio -- waiting for us in that ridiculous castle! Waiting for--!
I expected more from you.
All men love. But men like Hearst -- they don't bother with convention because--
It's good, huh?
Did I ever tell you about my father?
"And how is the country to feel when this industry continues to employ bedraggled foreigners and swarthy refugees instead of real Americans? Doesn't Hollywood know there's a Depression on? Don't real Americans deserve work?"
Who owns this town? Who runs every goddamn studio? The tribe, baby. These fuckers hear the word "Jew" and they start sweating. Like Ester Williams' pool they start sweating.
Monstro! Ran into Walter Winchell outside He wants to play Herod in the picture. Hiya, George.
Yes.
Thank you-
You're bettin' on an inside straight this time. You'll never pull it off.
"Rosebud? I'll tell you about Rosebud
For the title
They've all seen a rough cut
You don't think I've tried? No one is willing to open the picture
For Christ's sake, shut up--
How dare you talk to me like that! Do you think I'm like all the rest of those pirates?! Like Mayer and Warner? Is that what you think--?!
Oh God. . .
It was fun, wasn't it?
So, on to the Life Of Christ!
I know what you want but it can't be done!
Aside from everything else, your family all right?
Here's your carrots. You're in such a hurry. You can't wait.
I saw you fight Bob Satterfield in '46, Jake. In Chicago. You were great.
What's wrong?
Hit me in the face.
And that hard-on, Salvy. Who's he think he is? I'm gonna let that fuckin' hard-on come up here and act like a big shot.
Hey, I don't care about Tommy Como. I don't care about Jesus Christ on the fuckin' cross. I gotta give them a percentage of what I make! I'm in here breaking my ass, not them. Don't ever bring them up here again.
You wasn't with her, were you?
No, but Jake... how much abuse can you take.
They robbed us! Those fuckin' judges -- What the fuck fight were they watching? If I see them on the street, I'll break their heads. Decision Robinson, my fuckin' ass! Those judges give him the decision 'cause he's goin in the army next week! How else could this have happened?... What do you think they gave him the decision for, that's why.
Say what you're gonna say.
Excuse me for a minute. Be right back.
I want you to keep an eye on her when I'm not here. Understand?
Who did it have anything to do with... Vickie?
I'm tellin' you now, when I read this, it better not make me look bad.
Why not? There's nobody else around who wants to fight me; they're all afraid. I don't see why I shouldn't have a shot at the title right now.
Are you sure we should be doing this?
Take off my pants.
Now take the rest off.
Jake, you made me promise not to get you excited.
Who asked you?
Don't tell me "No." I saw you lookin' at him. Why, you like him?
Nobody. I love you, remember?
Positive.
I am answering...
Why don't you just call him up?
I miss Joey. I wish Joey was here.
I'm sorry. I had to work late last night. Slept at the club.
Are you kiddin'? Did you ever see a 14-year-old testify in court? Did you see the papers? "LaMotta on Vice Rap." Everybody likes a shot at the Champ.
Tomorrow, at the gym. Don't forget.
It was in her favorite handbag -- And, Mr. Doyle, that can lead to only one conclusion.
Because everything that man's done has been suspicious. Trips at night in the rain, saws, knives, trunks with rope, and a wife that isn't there any more.
I'll bet it's been done.
What time?
Now how could anybody guess that? They had, perhaps, signs on their luggage, "Grand Central Or Bust!"?
How did we ever stand each other in that same plane for three years?
You know, every day for three years I asked myself that same question?
Is -- is Anna -- who I think it is?
You think perhaps it was "old hambone?"
Something wrong?
Okay. Indo-China. Tuesday. We'll pick you up.
That's more like it. Goodnight, old buddy.
I'll give you a chance to find out. Meet me in the bar at the Brevoort -- and do it right away.
I only have a hundred dollars or so.
No.
It's happened before, you know! Some of the world's happiest marriage have started 'under the gun' you might say.
You're never going to marry?
We've progressed emotionally in --
Eyes bloodshot. Must have been staring out the window for hours.
Poor girl. Someday she'll find her happiness.
Isn't he a salesman?
Thank heaven that's over!
Would four of them -- ?
Ten here.
Thirty-three here. Totals one-ninety. Not enough.
What about the rest?
Hello.
Mrs. Doyle?
Not yet, Jeff.
Not too active.
It's cracked -- and you never use it. And it's too ornate. I'm sending up a plain, flat silver one -- with just your initials engraved.
Someday you might want to open up your own studio here.
Don't laugh. -- I could do it!
It doesn't make sense to me. What's so different about it here from over there, or any place you go, that one person couldn't live in both places just as easily?
Those high heels would be a lot of use in the jungle -- and those nylons and six-ounce lingerie --
I'm not exactly on the other side of the room.
Don't you ever have any problems?
Tell me about it.
He likes the way his wife welcomes him home.
Not that salesman's wife. And why didn't he go to work today?
You could see all the things he did, couldn't you?
Don't you see how silly you're being?
The name on the second floor rear mailbox reads Mr. And Mrs. Lars, that's L-A-R-S, Lars Thorwald.
What about it?
A woman has a favorite handbag -- it always hangs on her bedpost where she can get at it. Then she takes a trip and leaves it behind. Why?
I'm with you, sweetie, but Detective Thomas J. Doyle has a pat answer for that.
Don't be too hard on him. He's a steady worker. I wish he'd get there, though.
I'll trade you -- my feminine intuition for a bed for the night.
Do you think this was worth waiting all day to see?
Buzz?  What are we doing this for?
How'd he get in?
You see any cops?
Hold it, Jim.
You can't protect me.
You thought I was Mom?
Yeah!  Shh!
That's funny!
Yes.
Just give me a direct answer!  You going to stop me from going, Dad?
Ten years?  Now, Dad--I need an answer now!
I'm in terrible trouble.--You know that big high bluff near Miller- town Junction?
You're absolutely right!
Frank?  I'm frightened.
John Crawford?
What's your name!
Jim.  What's yours?
My personality's showing again. Should I leave?
Who's that!
Yeah?
They think you told the police on them.  They--who's in there?
I'm here.  Shut up.
When I was here?  When I ran away. I used to run away a lot but they always took me back.
I'm not going to hurt you. PLATO Why did you run out on me?
You sure?
You want to give me your gun now, Plato?
Why?
Those aren't my friends.  Make them go away.
What?
Good Lord!
He's not saying that!  He's saying don't volunteer!
No.
"If he could" what?  You mean your father?
I mean if he had the guts to knock Mom cold once I bet she'd be happy and I bet she'd stop picking.  They make mush out of him.  Just mush. One thing I know is I never want to be like him.
How can anyone grow up in this circus?
See?
Where what was.
No?  Why not?  You know something?  Sometimes I figure I'll never live to see my next birthday.  Isn't that dumb?
Sure.  Lots of times.
Not exactly.  It's certainly huge.
Why?
Is this what it's like to love somebody?
No!
We have to go back!
You should have heard him talk about you tonight.  Like you were the hero in the China Seas.
Oh, I don't know.  You have to get to know him.  He doesn't say much but when he does you know he means it.  He's sincere.
Do you think your father means that?
Yes!  I don't know!  I mean maybe he doesn't mean it but he acts like he does.  We're altogether and we're going to celebrate Easter and catch a double bill.  Big deal.  So I put on my new dress and I came out and he--
No.  I don't even know why I do it.
Your mother will be down in a few minutes, Judy--
What?
We used to sing it in school.  Don't look at me with such horror. They had schools in those days.
Nothing, only it'd be nice to spend an evening together for a change.
Good evening.
I'd like to, that's all.  Girls your age don't do that.  You need an explanation?
Gabriel, let him go --
He's shown us the setup, he's drawn us the map, he's helped us do the plan. He wants a gun, give him a gun. Take the bullets out, whatever, but give him the gun. The more manpower we've got in there, the better. He won't try and make his move till the money's in hand.
Toys for... adults?
Yeah.
Ashley, no. That was me, that's what I was scared of. I mean, be serious... I ain't exactly looking like Mr. Universe here.
Thought you wrote you had a mustache.
I can get another one going. Y'know, hey, whatever you want me to --
No, c'mon --
Tell me something. This the first time you've ever done this?
Guy I was in with... he helped sometimes... some of the romantic stuff, actually... you'd like him --
I'm talking about the heart, Nick. I'm not talking about the words.
Ash... didn't you write me that you don't eat chocolate?
Well, I don't know about that --
Blackjack, Nick, blackjack I am good at. I mean, they'd give us some free games or something, wouldn't they? Since you worked there?
And the slots, slots I'm good at too. Wouldn't that be fun?
NO!
You motherfucker.
If you say that, if you keep saying that, they will kill you. If they think you're not you, they will kill you. Don't you see? I know what you're doing, but it won't work!
He said he wanted to talk to you. When he found the letters... he said "when your boyfriend gets out, I wanna talk to him." I thought he meant back in Detroit. I thought he meant --
Since when do some trucker pals start thinking big, anyway?
They run routes mostly east, retail stuff, warehouses. But Gabriel knows some guys in New York, Miami, guys he helps get guns to Detroit. Hides 'em with his regular loads.
I love you, Nick...
I saved your life.
No --
But you were saying you were...
So you could get with my sister.
Bam Bam.
Hey, it's... been two years --
They won't recognize me.
We'll trust you when we're rich. Why not.
You do.
Start singing.
You are lucky, convict. You're spending Christmas with the birthday boy himself --
Get in the CAR!
How 'bout the tree? You want the tree?
The Powwow Safe where you steal your money! Where you cheat your Indians!
I'm bringing in this great showroom act next week; these three Russian girls, they look like Meryl Streep, they can juggle anything.
Guys. We're doing it right, here. $5.99 prime rib? Nobody does that in Michigan. Nobody.
The Powwow Safe. The secret safe. You said the manager's got a safe in his office where he hides skim money.
There anytime you don't got a mouthful of shit?
...but I got a girl to be with, rum- pum-pum-pum...
Haven't thought about it.
Yeah.
Why you gotta say a thing like that.
I don't know, I've seen the business world.
Millie here used to serve drinks to these gunrunning truckers, real big talkers, talking bout a real score one day. I was in the Mountain, man, what the hell, why not let her get friendly with 'em? Let her tell 'em an idea she had, 'bout writing guys in prison. Getting one who could show 'em a sure thing.
I... sorry, Mister...
But... I had a five...
What? No...
I'm ninety-two years old --
Watch your mouth, man. It's Christmas.
Elois?
I got a bag. I stashed it till I could be sure this place wasn't a police station.
The black Beverly Hills. I knew this lady from Ladora Heights once.  "Hi, I'm from Ladora Heights, it's the black Beverly Hills."
The way they talk to each other. You can tell they're buddies.
It's a scene. Memorize it.
It's a amusing anecdote about a drug deal.
It's like a joke. You remember what's important, and the rest you make your own. The only way to make it your own is to keep sayin' it, and sayin' it, and sayin' it, and sayin' it, and sayin' it.
Tell me more about Cabot.
Let's go over it. Where are you?
Mr. Brown?
Mr. Blonde and Mr. Blue?
Toby... who the fuck is Toby? Toby... Toby... think... think... think...
Wong?
Nobody's trading with anybody! Look, this ain't a goddamn fuckin' city counsel meeting! Listen up Mr. Pink. We got two ways here, my way or the highway. And you can go down either of 'em. So what's it gonna be, Mr. Pink?
She hooked up with Fed McGar, they've done a couple a jobs together. Good little thief. So, explain the telegram.
Not a problem, got guys waitin' for it. But what happened to Marsellus Spivey? Didn't he always move your ice?
Two minutes, tops. It's a tough two minutes. It's daylight, during business hours, dealing with a crowd. But you'll have the guys to deal with the crowd.
Joe, I don't know what you think you know, but you're wrong.
He don't believe in it?  You don't believe in it?
I know.
Freddy Newendyke.
Marvin, I need you to hold on. There's officers positioned and waiting to move in a block away.
That fuckin' shooting spree in the store.
Follow you where?
Oh excuse me, I didn't realize you had a degree in medicine. Are you a doctor? Are you a doctor? Answer me please, are you a doctor?
You're not gonna fucking die, all right?
What happened?
Look, enough of this "Mr White" shit -
No real people?
Did ya see what happened to anybody else?
Not even a chance they punched through? You found a hole.
How can you be so sure?
Where?
No, they're not in the car. No, I don't have them on me. Ya wanna go with me and get 'em? Yes, we can go right now. But first listen to what I'm telling you. We were fuckin' set up! Somebody is in league with the cops. We got a Judas in our midst. And I'm thinkin' we should have our fuckin' heads examined for waiting around here.
I swear to god I'm fuckin' jinxed.
He ain't dead.
Well, he knows a little about me.
We ain't taking him to a hospital.
So you wanna git bit, huh?
Then. That time has passed. Right now, Mr. Blonde is the only one I completely trust. He's too fuckin' homicidal to be workin' with the cops.
Not these guys.
We're going to look for him. Want to come along?
And that's more important than finding Lednov?
What's she doin' runnin' around the country at night.
And one of 'em is sick.
This must have been in the family a long time.
You can't leave us here.
What good is it going to do us to go to some ranch?
If you were in his shoes would you take one of us home?
I suppose it is.
Thanks.
You know so much about me -- figure it out.
Goodbye. Thanks for the lift.
Here's a man says he's looking for you girls.
Who's Lednov?
You sure worry that bone. He killed a fellow.
They sure must have been travelin'. This keeps up we can start a store.
You remember Jeff Rawson? -- We used to go fishing and hunting with him when you were so high.
Maybe I should. But I was never much on killin'. Anyway, he moved too quick and I just got him through the shoulder.  Looks pretty peaceful up ahead.
Leaving them here when we could just as well take them. We got plenty of room in the wagon. And -- and -- they cook and drive the mules. They don't bother anybody.
Come on. We got a couple hours to eat and get some sleep.
I'll eat when I'm good and ready.
Kind of feeling your oats this morning. I haven't laid a hand on you for quite a while, but that doesn't mean you're too old.
It is so your fault and... and I guess maybe when we hit the ranch... you andme better...
Yeah -- but don't make a habit of it.
So -- maybe I'm old enough to tell you how to run your life?
I'm sorry about this, Mr. Wyatt. I didn't know who she was.
You're not bein' quite fair.
You can't stay here. There's snakes and it's cold and you'll just get sicker.
She mustn't -- don't you let her --
What's the matter -- restless?
Yes, people make me restless.
Some people who went by this way lost it.  Two men and some women. They packed their stuff on horses and went on.
And you're all alone.
Goodbye and thanks.
With a milk pail in one hand and a marriage license in the other.
Until Pa gets around to driving us to Minden.
We don't want to go there.
Give it back to him. We're leavin'.
Because there's a man I want to see.
And that's tough, isn't it?
What do they look like?
Would they be good to eat?
An' if you can't hunt 'em and even if you could they'd be tough, what's the use of knowin' how to spell them?
Nobody's gonna catch him sleeping. Don't worry about him.
Ah, they just don't know you the way I do.
Oh, remember that time I got my training bra and you --
Hello Brenda.
Shhh... It's okay.
Ray, have you been here all this time?
I'm fine. Just a few bruises.
He's right. I should go first.
That's just it, Buddy. I'm a girl. You can't be so rough with me.
It looks like the furnace.
Well, if that's Hanson, then who's the guy with the hand?
Yeah, I think I'm bleeding.
What are we gonna do? I'm cold. I can't move, I'm so cold.
No, Buddy, I'm the one he wants.
Look, what I'm trying to say --
Oh.
You know, walking on the beach, holding hands, kissing, making love...
Oh, Buddy, that's so romantic.
So, whatever happened to her?
It's okay.
What's your location? I repeat, what's your location?
Hanson, please.
Would you like me to help you pass them back?
He won't let us go. He's going to kill us.
Yes, we made it!
Aww, you ain't that bad. You just need a little flava. First thing we gotta do is get you some new gear.
Gear. You know, clothing.
Let me see the files.
Yes. The scored all over the Kiersey Temperament Sorter just like you asked for.
Willing? I like that.  And, this one?
Fantastic. These kids are exactly the kind of catalyst needed to awaken Hell House.
So, if one of our little chickadees is taking a shower which one of these buttons do I press to get a close- up?
Let's not forget, folks, this is a study on sleep disorders.
What is it, Dwight?
Hello Dwight.
What if I wanted to borrow those keys?
She's right. We should stick together.
Excuse me, sir, but the students have started to arrive. Dinner will be ready shortly.
A little bit... Give me your belt.
You mean to tell me we're dead!
This part removes the sense of humor.
"Fucked me."
Mrs. Sutphin?
0h, shit!
Turn right on Timonioum Road. Hurry, Dad!
I'm Dr. Eugene Sutphin. What's the trouble, officer?
You see the sign! It's a dollar fine for not rewinding and this time I'm gonna charge you! $2.99 plus one dollar is $3.99!
You kids. Now Birdie, I want you to have a cookie and then run along home.
God, Mom!  What's the matter?
In here, Mom...
I know this sounds weird, Mr. Sutphin, but the Department of Motor Vehicle's computer shows only one blue station wagon registered to a parent of any of Mr. Stubbins' pupils.
Hi, Hank.
Nothing like a home cooked meal, honey.
I'm sorry, honey. But the birds will still be there next week.
Det. Bradford, I'm sorry but we don't allow gum chewing in this house. 
Sorry, ma'am.  We're investigating obscene phone calls and mail threats to a certain Mrs. Dottie Hinkle.
Well, this magazine was found in your trash just last night...  ...It's called "Chicks with Dicks".
Objection! Argumentative!
The police are tracing your call right this minute.
Listen to your dirty mouth, you fucking whore!
Mrs. Hinkle... do you drink?
You mean to tell me the day I came over to Mrs. Ackerman's... the day you claim you recognized my voice... you weren't drinking?
It's him!
Damn these yellow-jackets! I hate 'em!
It's just not your day, is it Rosemary?
I saw one, but it was ridiculously overpriced!
Beverly, honey, you've got some...  ...do-do on your shoe.
Sure I do.
Why would Mrs. Redi lie to me?
I don't like this.
I read your book. The one in which you wrote about the cure for drinking.
I'm afraid she can't do that, Ward. It would endanger her.
But tell me --
Redi's all right.
She seems rather an odd woman to me.
The tip is, anyhow. I like to work on your hair.
Some of us, Frances, must believe without understanding.
Weren't you afraid?
Thank you. It was a lovely dinner.
It's not much money, but it's enough to live on. You'd have to move out of that hotel and into a furnished room.
What brought you down here, Greg?
Oh, I had business with a man... but I missed him -
But I'm better than a detective. I have an understanding of people - and a love of them -- an understanding of the city - -
Yes. It's been quiet, oh ever so quiet. I hardly move, yet it keeps coming all the time -closer and closer. I rest and rest and yet I am dying.
I don't know.
Were you going to make a suggestion?
That's it. And this figure --she traced it. The book I saw at the library had been marked "perfect" by the library inspector in March. Mrs. Redi had it out in April. No one else had read it since.
It's all clear to me now -- so clear.
Look. I'm serious. It's a real and vary earnest society -- a dangerous society...
It's not a searchlight  it's a sword blade cutting the blue cloak of a prince - not stars --
Ah, my Jason -- always laughing -- always trying to help others.  He's a good boy, Miss -- he just talks that way.
Why, Mr. Jason. Most of these books are on the closed shelf. You have to get permission.
See that girl? That's Jacqueline's sister. It's because of her I ask.
Because there was another girl years ago -- a nice girl. She lived on Barrow Street. I saw her with you once - I saw her with you twice and then I never saw her again. That's why.
I think I understand without your telling me. I know something of your history, Jason. I know that you haven't written for ten years.
This is curious, Jason. Half the time you talk as if Shakespeare were not fit to tie your shoelaces; now this sudden humility.
It goes beyond that. It praises the goodness of God and the greatness of all His works.
I think it's time.
But I'm not coming to you out of deep conviction, I'm coming to you out of loss. I no longer can believe in the power and the rightness of things that are called good.
This is the most amusing thing I have ever heard and with a bit of gossip to season it  your failure with Jacqueline. Has she returned to her husband?
Mary, I'm amazed. Didn't Jacqueline tell you? She sold the business to me at least eight months ago. It's my business now.
I'll be out in a minute.
I don't believe it.
But she was here?
But, Mrs. Lowood, I can't just stay here not knowing what's happened to my sister. Maybe if I went to New York -- if I saw Mrs. Redi myself --
I don't know no Gibson. This is a restaurant. Many people come here.
What?
But he also wrote --
It is a very real danger and one which forces our decision.
That was quick.
You play an instrument?
What about it do you like? I'm not being critical, I'd really like to know.
You mean like "time flies"?
This food is excellent.
Hi!
Donna?
No.
And they just answer them?
I'm sorry this came up.
Yes.
It won't. Are you ready?
Interesting analogy.
I'm babbling.
God, I m so mad at him!!
That's very flattering.
Why not?
No.
Not entirely.
Come on!!
John?
Something wrong?
Look, this conversation is utterly ridiculous. Maybe when you have some evidence, we should talk, but don't give me conjecture and intuition.
Always the lawyer.
What do you mean?
God, no.
You understand that you are free to leave therapy at any time?
Do you want to leave therapy?
You know what. You say it just to irritate me.
But he won't.
I don't feel right just giving you the address so that you can go over there and...
Don't you think she deserves a little more than a card? I mean, the woman gave birth to you. It's her fiftieth birthday --
No, he's not dangerous. Not physically.
I don't want to talk about it.
Then why'd you call me?
I mean, I couldn't do that in front of John, even.
You know what I mean, you don't even know him!
I feel like I do.
It looks like a tablecloth.
The extrovert.
She must have been in a good mood when she said that. She usually calls me loud.
Well, like I said, Ann is my sister. Sisters talk. You can imagine the rest.
She still is.
And are you here to berate me for making her that way?
Well, I don't really listen to her when it comes to men. I mean, look at John, for crissake. Oh, you went to school with him didn't you? You're probably friends or something.
Sex. Your sexual history, your sexual preferences.
I just want to ask you questions.
Is this how you get off or something? Taping women talking about their sexual experiences?
I was... eight years old. Michael Green, who was also eight, asked if he could watch me take a pee. I said he could if I could watch him take one, too. He said okay, and then we went into the woods behind our house. I got this feeling he was chickening out because he kept saying, "Ladies first!" So I pulled down my underpants and urinated, and he ran away before I even finished.
What did you think? Did it look like you expected?
What did he say?
He said that my hand felt good.
If you wish.  You're not wearing any underwear.
Hello.
Oh.  Well, when, then?
Do you want me to stop calling?
Right.
I wish you hadn't done that.
You realize you have no recourse legally? This stuff could show up anywhere.
Actually, no, I've changed my mind. I shouldn't have called.
Come on, John. You should be happy, we've gone this far without Ann finding out, I'm making it real easy on you. Just walk out of here and I'll see you at your house for a family dinner sometime.
Graham.
Will you lease month-to-month?
Especially if you want to leave someplace in a hurry.
Hi, John.
She's not property, John, she's a person. Were you just going to keep right on lying to her?
May I ask who's calling?
John Millaney.
Okay, in a minute, I'm on with a client.
Hi.
OK, then. I'm gonna go back to the store and buy my own pack and smoke 'em all myself.
So you just came up to visit this Hobbes and you found them like that?
How did he sound this time? Was he nervous? Depressed?
Mrs. Ementhal's ready and waiting, Doctor.
Where is he now? Do you know?
I think I... I think I killed him. I stabbed him with something and he fell.
Do you want to make love? You're absolutely beautiful, those eyes, that expression. You're absolutely the most sexy thing alive. Do you want to make love?
You will make love to me, won't you, Janine? Won't you make love to me? You start it. Won't you? I think I've forgotten how to start.
Good shape for an old man, eh?
Gonna cut me open?
Not exactly the kind of lunch Hobbes would have laid on you, Rog, but it's all I got, and...  ...all I got I share with you. Go ahead. Take all you want.
You oughta be careful yourself. Might end up cutting your throat.
Yes?
OK, I bite. What does it look like?
I don't get it.
Yeah? What do I do then?
NIGHT NIGHT
BREAKING OUT
I got it!  I got it!!!
Infantile regression.
I've caught it once or twice.
Right!  An early start with Janet's debut on 'Good Morning Denton.' By the time we unveil Farley's 'Faith Factory' we will have earned our beauty sleep.
Why Janet?
In my time they used to call me the Merlin of Berlin.
We're the experts.
Out of self comes selflessness.
Judge Wright?  Now, Betty? First name terms, surely!
Macy Struthers -- God I must have been blind -- still, the weaker the man, the dumber the blonde.
Now Betty, don't overreact.
That's us.
I'm not going, Janet.
SOME PEOPLE DO IT TO BE FUNNY
Oh, Harry.  What are we going to do?
Absolutely correct.
Just what the Doctor ordered.  I know.  Come on in, my favourite show's just started.
I've just come to tell you how fabulous I am.
You are the most desirable creature that ever walked.
But what'll I do?  What'll I say?  What'll I wear?
Ah.  Mr. And Mrs. Majors.  How wonderful to see you.  I am Dr. Cosmo McKinley and this is my sister, and colleague, Nation McKinley.
YOU'VE GOT DIRT ON YOUR HANDS AND EVERYBODY UNDERSTANDS YOU'RE NO GOOD
YOU FEL LIKE CHOKING YOU PLAY FOR BROKE...
THIS COULD BE THE START OF A WHOLE NEW CAREER HERE
I don't know. You just seem really familiar to me. Never mind. Enjoy your meals.
I don't know, Christine. Perhaps it's because I feel attacked.
Miles.
Are you there? Miles?
Yeah, well, you should be my agent.
Is it chicken?
Hey, guys. How's it going?
How you doin' tonight, beautiful?
Hiya.
Anything I'd know?
No, I didn't. What I said was that my agent had heard there was some interest at Conundrum...
Come on, we're celebrating. I say we pop it.
Pinot Noir? How come it's white? Doesn't noir mean dark?
Did you read the latest draft, by the way?
How old's she going to be?
That's your problem, Miles.
As if she'd even be attracted to guys like us in the first place.
Hey, Miles. I really hope your novel sells.
What color is it supposed to be?
Huh.
What do you smell?
Huh. Maybe a little strawberry. Yeah, strawberry. I'm not so sure about the cheese.
Uh-huh.
Then it's a good thing.
The chick digs you. She lit up like a pinball machine when she heard your novel was getting published.
Sure, big guy. Whatever you say. It's your party. I'm sorry I'm in the way and dragging you down. Maybe you'd have a better time on your own. You take the car. I'll catch the train back.
Jesus Christ, Miles. Get out!
Aye-aye, captain.
Let's just say I'm uncomfortable with the whole scenario.
And don't forget all the bad times you had with Victoria. How small she make you feel. That's why you had the affair in the first place.
Oh, boy.
What the fuck are you doing?
Does she know about Saturday?
Besides what?
Yes I have, and do I look like a happy man? Was all that drama with Brenda a happy thing for me to do? Huh? Was it? Is she a part of my life now?
And what about Stephanie? She's a woman -- with a kid. A single mom. What do you think she's looking for? Huh?
What? Of course I like Christine.
Call me on my cell if you go out.
Nope.
I said okay?
You have to tell me --
Yeah, they're great. Sporty. They're really sporty.
I don't know. Tastes okay to me.  Hey, they got a reserve pinot.
Let me use your phone.
Thanks.
Half my life is over, and I have nothing to show for it. I'm a thumbprint on the window of a skyscraper. I'm a smudge of excrement on a tissue surging out to sea with a million tons of raw sewage.
Wasn't supposed to be back till six. Fucker rolls in at five.
So what's the plan?
Hrnrnrn?
You said it looked like a car accident.
What the fuck!
Whatever. Sorry.
Hey, Miles. Good to see you.
Oh yeah, Sunday night. You guys been out tasting today?
This is good. Little hints of clove.
Yeah, I know.
Is she sleeping or...?
You got kids?
Who me? Nah, I'd just fuck them up. That was the one unpolluted part of my divorce -- no kids.
Yeah? Like what?
I had class.
Oh, just that he loves her. That she's the only woman who has ever really rocked his world. How he adores Siena. How he wants to move up here and get a place with the two of them and commute when he has to.
Hi. It's Maya. Please leave a message.
I'm pregnant.
How much skin and stem contact?
Hi, guys. We should probably get going.
Stephanie! Stop!
...Tell Bo to listen to her brother. He'll always take care of her.
Five. The five longest.
Explain, act crazy?
It was very dark.
Yes.
I'm sorry, what book is this?
They're distracting us?
No.
He's been like that for awhile. We need to get him some medicine.
So the aliens can't read our minds.
Where are we going to sleep?
French toast... and mashed potatoes.
Stop crying!
The footprints.
What was the first thing?
Jake, I'm going to ask you once -- was it self-defense?
Forget the money. You've got to get these people out of here. This is no place to be sitting with women and kids.
Sounds good.
...Gotta go...
Where's Jake?
You must have known that before you came.
Weren't you going to come out to say good-bye?
I'm just meeting a guy here and moving on. So far I haven't been able to find him.
I expect.
Shame about the kid. Seems a lively sort.
He is that.
You haven't got any money.
All I'm saying is, you won't trip over me if you look her up.
I paid the government for it, all right. That don't mean much out here.  Malachi, I'm living like a wildcat in a cave in those hills. Hiding out, afraid to walk my own land.
I don't believe in luck. I know what Conrad was like. Don't tell me what you think I want to hear.
A lot of men have told me that. Maybe it's true. I guess some women are slow to believe it.
Because they don't like what I want.
It was not -- it was Murdo's. Those McKendricks don't know how to act like human beings.
I can't say I'm convinced you're going anywhere.
Where's your brother?
Came to the wrong town. I don't tolerate this kind of thing. It's hard on the peace, and it's hard on the furniture. Now, knowing a bit about Carter here, I'm going to let you go without paying for the damages. But go you will, and I mean now.
This nigger's breaking up my place, Sheriff Langston.
I don't like that word much, Carter.
Cobb, you've got nothing I need.
What a waste. This could have been such a sweet deal for us.
I'll drink to that. Will you join me, Miss --
Stella... Are you the midnight star herself?
So-called?
Yeah, aside from being a loud-mouthed, lying cheat, he's just the man I would have picked.
I'm saving lives here. The straight stuff would raise a blood blister on boot leather.
What makes you say that?
So, of course, you couldn't kill Simone because there never was a Simone.
But not everyone's imaginary, are they, Mr. Taransky?  I refer, of course, to Edith.
Can you tell us why you were disposing of the body of a woman who didn't exist?
Thanks.  This is my exit so, I --
I'm glad we talked.
Well, I do remember why I started out in this business -- you seem to have forgotten -- working in New York with Cassevetes -- we were trying to do something important, shine a light in that darkened cinema --
-- Illuminate hearts and minds with a ray of truth.
Listen, Viktor, I have good memories of those days too -- but this isn't about that or you or me or some high-minded ideal.  This is business.
The picture's dead.
Viktor... I want to thank you for convincing Simone to sign with the studio.
Almost right.
Viktor, it's my studio.
What about it?
Soon.  Soon.
Elaine, what are you doing tonight? Would you like to go somewhere -- dinner?
Excuse me?  Start?
She's lying down.  She's exhausted.
I know.  I know.  They'll say anything.
I would rather have you than Simone.  Believe me.
How much wine have you had?
Hello?
Well, I --
Obviously, this can't last.  She's going to dump him.  Viktor won't be able to take that.  He's too sensitive.  It'll destroy him.
You look so, so...
What I do to Simone?
Well, no one could accuse you of being over-exposed, Simone.  Why have you stayed so completely out of the limelight?
What exactly was it that attracted you to your first two projects?
Hal, what are you doing?
Viktor, Clyde simply has to get close to Simone in this scene!  He has to touch her.  He has to!
That's the point, Hank.  No matter how good they are, they're still Mickey Mouse.  Everyone's tried. Everyone's failed.  It can't be done.
Harry!  Harry!  Can we have a minute?  What brings you here tonight?
It's really... not anything, Lainey.  It's just --
Hi, Dad.
She's a miracle, Dad.  Where did you find her?
I saw her picture on the, er... internet.  You really didn't notice anything -- unusual?
Okay.  But you have to find a way to escape that thing.
I read.
One thing bothered me.
Good-night, Daddy.
Happy birthday, Lainey.  Do you like it?
It's the car she drove in "Eternity Forever".
Don't you have a real story to write?  Why aren't you in Latin America?
Our leaders aren't presidents anymore -- they're pop stars and screen idols.  If Woodward and Bernstein were alive today, they'd be right here in Hollywood with me.
Nice try.  If we can't get to her through you, maybe your family will be more co-operative.  I can guarantee you, Taransky, one way or another, Miss Simone and I are going to get acquainted.
Nice boat, Taransky.
I don't have time for this, Sayer.
-- I bet you have.
I traced her to a nursing home.  A young woman fitting Simone's description dropped her off five years ago.
That doesn't prove a thing -- wait until I get a court order for a blood test.
Well, we got some of Taransky's fingerprints, a lot of your fingerprints... but none of hers.
Mr. Sayer...
What do you want -- ?
Mr. Sayer, did we pay the million bucks yet?
-- I've been here before! -- On my honeymoon with my ex-wife.
But that's Simone's part.
What if it catches on fire?
Speaking of which -- this is the project I'd like you to do next.
They're my dad's. The lenses hurt my eyes.
All your soldiers speak Latin?
You're a doctor. What kind?
You mean aneurysm.
I walk this way to school with Tommy Tammisimo.
You ever tell her about how it is with Tommy?
Dr. Crowe.
You haven't told bedtime stories before?
No.
No, walking around, like regular people... They can't see each other. Some of them don't know they're dead.
Tommy Tammisimo acted in a cough syrup commercial. He thought everybody was self-conscious and unrealistic. He said the play sucked big time.
What do you want more than anything?
When?
I'm going to transfer you. I know two psychologists that are exceptional--
I wish I were somewhere else.
I think we said everything we needed to say.  Maybe it's time to say things to someone else? Someone close to you?
What are you thinking, Momma?
You didn't take it before. You didn't take it the time after that. And now, you didn't take it again?
Don't get mad.
They?
...I don't know.
Cole, please stop.
Yes, Cole?
Stuttering Stanley! Stuttering Stanley!
S-ssstop that!
Stuttering--
Good for you.
Your pa's waiting for you up at the house.
Your grandfather sure believed in it. Worked pretty good... too.
You were a beat and a quarter behind.
Slut.
Suzie???
You know, one day I'm going to have to shut down that still of yours, Jeremiah.
"Peggy-Sue" --
Curt Cobain.
Carl! Oh Carrrrl!
Joseph Macdonald... Your son.
How... was she "called?"
That old barn. After the fire... I rebuilt it nail by nail. Just the way your granddaddy would've wanted it.
-- It's not me!
It's time to make amends.
Hey. Could you be a little more insensitive? We're on our way to a funeral for Crissake.
Hallelujah! ...Civilization... here I come!
You wanna know the difference? The difference is that you're screwing up the song.
Try taking a left after the next cow pasture.
This... used to be Jethro's room. The attic.
Getting ready.
Billy Bob's dead. -- We were wrong -- he didn't do anything. I-It's the scarecrow --
Wait a minute --
Get out of here.
It's coming right up. After the third verse.
Carl.
No reception out here.
My father, he was -- he was real close to evil. People didn't know. Still don't. From the time I was a toddler he'd beat the hell out of me. I don't mean just like a smack for smart--mouthing... he took a real enjoyment in it. And when I turned eleven or twelve, things... well, they got worse. Starla looks at Bill, who seems struck.
He wants me, Bill! I'm going to get him to take me to him! See if you can follow me, and kill him!
We can probably get some first aid and food at this gas station up here.
I'll get it for you. Ibuprofen or aspirin?
He's gotta be in the forest. All three ranches run alongside it.
Looks like a chipmunk.
Are you nodding?
Guess it's hard to explain how amazin' a human brain is to someone who that's all they know.
Thinkin' 'bout getting me a couple of these big ol' rib eyes.
All the rib eyes?
My present?
Grant. Oh my God. What happened to your -- ?
So he drags the cow backwards here. Only he prolly didn't know 'bout the Castavets had them dogs.
Maybe you better sit back down. You don't look so good.
Not that I don't have any respect for the law, but what's your problem, man?
Cute. No, 'cause no one's ever made it from Atlanta to Texarkana and back in twenty-eight hours.
Whaddya want to know? My sign?
Anything?
Shoot.
Enough to get to Jersey. I'll walk the rest of the way. I've been sitting a long time.  Nice meeting you. It's been a trip.
You know this guy, don't you?
It's not the beer. He just wants to see me fail.
What kind of a guy is he?
He's just exhausted.
What's your pleasure?
Cledus.
You know of course, we ain't ever gonna make it.
Go.
I'm gonna run a couple miles ahead of you. Keep both feet on the floor. We'll be moving ninety and over.
We still on schedule?
Never mind. It's nothing.
Ran into a little hassle at the eatum- up-stop.
How's the clock, Bandit II.
When we agree to do a job, we do it. Right?
Oh, yeah. Good for him.
Is that Bandit in the lead?
I still think this whole idea is dumb, pop.
-- Road looks clean as a hound's tooth.
Welcome to the new Bureau. Nobody shares information anymore, it's become synonymous with job security.
-- Agent Carruthers. Do you know where is he now?
Who?
And this is your car, isn't it?
Mmm-hmm.
Yeah, m'brothers... They didn't make it.
If I needed your I.D. and your car and me and my brothers were wanted by the law, I woulda killed you to get 'em too.
You woulda?
...About what?
Then quit acting like somebody shit in your cereal bowl. Reed just gave us fifty grand.
What'd you say?
About what?
I dunno... Cinnamon roll?
...I'm sorry...
I am. Yeah.
Without peer?
This is him? The hitman hired to kill Israel? He's a doctor?
-- will be handled back in --
I'll overlook what you've done here today in light of what's taken place. You've been fully debriefed. Now I want you to return to D.C. immediately and make no further inquiry into this matter. I mean it. It's closed.
I'm working on it.
-- I don't know, I feel like you always pushin' up on me, gettin' close and I love you baby, in every way you can love a bitch, 'cept that one.
What'd you say?
...Shhhhhhit... girl, there's these two dudes, just sittin' here in this elevator, all shot up...
Forty-five apiece for you two, ten percent finders fee for me.
You think you're dreaming me, like you dream her.  Understand something: I am the real Gibarian.  Just a new incarnation.
You'll end up like me.
Meaning Man can do whatever the fuck it wants?
How much sleep do you need?
Probably.
What will you say?
I don't know.
-- we are not sure of that.  We are not sure we aren't all hallucinating.
But why is it doing what it's doing? Given it's resources, it could have done anything.  Presented me with your double, and you with mine.
Human beings can die.
Who are you trying to please? Yourself?  Her?  Which her, this one or that one.  Can you face both?  We are in a situation that is beyond morality.  So: Leave with her.  You'll see the transformation.
You'll see her die, that's all. They're mortal, despite what she told you.  She will die.  Then what will you do?
I love her.
I'll go with you.
Stop it.
You behave as though you want to fuck her.
You're better when you take them.
I can't help feeling that I'm cheating when I take them.
How could she not be real?  I can smell her, taste her.  She does exactly what she did... it's not possible.
What's wrong.
Yes.  Especially toward the end.
You're the coward.
You don't want me.
Do you want to stay here?
What's happening to us?
I'm not Rheya.  You've always known that.
I never said I didn't.
Chris, please.  Chris, I'm serious. I won't make it.
Who are you, then?
When?
Followed by non-human manifestations.
Claire!
You didn't like him?
I'm sorry.  I'm not sure how this works.  I have to go out... is that all right?
I have to pick something up before Bergdorf's closes, then stop at a reception just a few blocks away.
Can we go then?
Beg pardon?
I guess I'm supposed to do it in the morning.  Identify him.
You put it back in the wrong place... Do you like Renoir?
You mean to tell me, a mugger would stay away from someone because they walked a certain way?
Yeah.  It was.
Yeah.
No dog.
You don't like him, do you?
Claire?
Let go!
Stop being nuts!
Not exactly.
You don't want to know.
Yeah.
So.
Claire...
... He killed Win... he enjoyed it...
Ellie, you know I think it's about time we got outa this place, get us a house of our own.  We can afford it now.
Amen to that.  The supermarket's full of assholes.
So how'd it go?
For how long?
Changing the sparks.  They showed it on TV.  What d'you think?
I think television's a dangerous thing.
I read the article.  You didn't tell me she was so beautiful.
What shit, honey?
I don't know that Ellie.  He might get out.  Garber's not bein' straight with the witness, she could be in deep shit if she identifies him, and it's my job to convince her she won't be.
She took you shopping for a tie?
I'm her bodyguard, goddamnit...
She bought it.
Few minutes.  Want to catch the news.
What?
What're you talking about --
Even Joey Venza?!
He's got a good lawyer, and he made a smart move.  We've got a scared witness and a suspect who proved "good will" by turning himself in.
Wasn't your fault.
Are you in charge here?
How do I know that's her?
Let my kid go.
I'm not lettin' no one go.
Watch your step!
Except the goddamn skateboards, which are everywhere!  I'd like to kill the guy who invented those things.
And Flash isn't?
Ah, ya know.  Neighborhood's not what it used to be.  Kid no more'n five swiped a candy bar the other day.
I know.  Still thinking about retiring?
Ya still follow the Mets, Pete?
No, no, listen. They're tryin' to say he was in cahoots with this killer--
Lizzy!
You can be great, kid, just stick with it. But let me give you one little piece of advice... be a good guy.
Parker-- you go here, right?  Got your camera?
Relax, Jameson.  This is business. I know you want photos of me, so I'll give your boy Parker an exclusive.  On one condition--
Frmpph-yrr.
Oh, that?  It'll come unstuck in a half-hour or so. Your mouth needs the rest.  Bye.
Some things you should say anyway.
What if you get hurt?
It's never too early to be clever. Describe in a sentence how you feel about me.
You should write that one down.
Sort of.  I'm returning the-- that outfit that you hated so much. Maybe I can get my money back.
No, it wasn't only you-- it -- it just wasn't my style.  Hey, look-- let's go to lunch.  Someplace nice for a change.
Well, no.
I'm sorry about being a jerk this afternoon.
Peter?
Octavius wasn't the murderer type.
But you said he went off a little, after the accident, when those mechanical arms--
It's a lot of ground to cover. We'll try.  Funny coincidence, huh?
Yeah, Roz.
I am old enough to--
--but I didn't feel like getting to know your roaches.
Funny thing happened after my physics class today. Harry Osborn--
A match made in heaven.
I was napping on the couch.  There was a voice and a shot.  I woke up. Ben was looking at me.
How is he?
Is this some sort of Zen thing?
I mean, I suddenly have immense physical power, and the ability to crawl up walls--
Then you'll be glad to know the University has decided not to press criminal charges against you. Breaking and entering the minor matter of the total destruction of a 23 million dollar cyclotron
Otto, we are mere mortals. You must never forget your own limits--
Really.  I'd like to speak with him.
I don't think I'll be running into him.
Hello, uh, Mr. Reiss?  I'm-- I'm the guy who wrestled Hulk Hogan the other day.  The guy in the mask?
Like it?
I listened to him talk of eternal truth and thought of the Bhagavad Gita, the Indian holy book-- "I am become Shiva, Death-- the destroyer of worlds."  Octavius was...
I wouldn't talk about things like that.
What's wrong with him?
Do Cagney. Like you did yesterday.
What's the match gag?
Ready?
That's not the point, Cookie. The point is what do you do with him? You tip your mitt and the Jerries pull him out of here and plant him someplace else, like Stalag Sixteen or Fifteen. Or you kill him off and the Krauts turn around and kill off the whole barracks. Every one of us. So what do you do?
So long, Cookie. The department store is all yours. What's left of it.
Come on, Trader Horn! Let's hear it: what'd you give the Krauts for that egg?
Just what makes you and them Krauts so buddy-buddy?
I grease the Kraut guards. With ten percent of the take.
And maybe a little something else?
Let's get on with what? What is this anyway? A Kangaroo Court? Why don't you get a rope and do it right?
Then we're all in on it?
Come on, Schulz! Spill it! How did you get the information? About Manfredi and Johnson? About the stove and the tunnel? Who's giving it to you? Which one of us is it?
What did you expect, a St. Bernard dog?
I don't know what you're talking about, Colonel.
What exactly is he charged with?
You were saying --?
Good morning, Animal! What'll it be for breakfast? Scrambled eggs with little sausages? Bacon and eggs sunny- side up? Griddle cakes? A waffle?
I'll kill you, Harry -- so help me!
'We will remove the iron stove -- the one that was camouflaging the trap door.'
I'm telling you, Animal -- these Nazis ain't Ko --
Hey -- Russki -- Russki! Look at those bublichkis! Over here!
If she don't want you, she don't get anything.
Grable, not Gable!
May I have this dance, Miss?
Betty! Betty!
Yes, Sergeant Hoffman?
I don't know what your scheme is, but it sounds crazy.
Maybe it's crazy, but it's better than having Dunbar dead.
You'd better cut out in back of the south latrine.
What happened, Cookie? Who did it?
You'll stay in this barracks and not a peep out of you.
Who did?
You could use a new one yourself.
I went to school with a guy named Price. But that was in Boston. You're from Cleveland, aren't you.
What did you say?
Will you get this guy out of my hair so I can go?
Let us see. We have now two empty bunks here.  Nummer einundsiebzig und Nummer dreiundsiebzig in Baracke vier.
Wunderbar! Maybe they are too wunderbar for my wife. But there is a piano teacher in the village --
The one you work with. Who is he? How do you do it?
Look at all that meat. Isn't she the bitter end!
You're not disposing of those Russian broads?
Target their Bridge.
Tomorrow I want to make a tri-elliptical jump. That's where you jump out over Northern China and make three complete orbits before you start re-entry.
The star's destruction has had numerous astro-physical effects within this sector. However, none of them appear to have a connection to the energy ribbon.
No, sir. I am finding it difficult to concentrate. I believe I am overwhelmed with feelings of remorse and regret concerning my actions on the observatory.
What do you mean?
Now, you said the gravitational forces in this sector have been altered, could that also affect the course of the ribbon?
Well?
I have rerouted auxiliary power to the lateral thrusters- attempting to level our descent.
The ships are bearing at 3-1-0 mark 2-1-5. Distance: three light years.
Do you remember him?
Yes, where would you go?
What makes you think things will be any different this time?
This clock, I gave this clock to Bones.
Not exactly. As I said, this is some kind of-
You said history considers me dead. Who am I to argue with history?
I take it the odds are against us and the situation is grim?
An anti-matter discharge directly ahead=8A it might disrupt the field long enough for us to break away.
Imagine what it was like, Will. No engines, no computers, just the wind, the sea and the stars to guide you.
Hmm,  Inform Starfleet Command. This could indicate a new Romulan threat in this sector.
My brother had shouldered that burden, allowing me to pursue my own selfish needs.
The Nexus.
An experimental compound the Romulans have been working on. In theory, a trilithium-based explosive would be thousands of times more powerful than an anti-matter weapon. But they never found a way to stabilize it.
Have Geordi and Data go over with the next Away Team. Tell them to scan the observatory for trilithium.
Nothing. As before.
Still no response, sir.
Like your father... so human.  All units functional, recorders are on... Scanning sector one. Foliage in fully developed state of growth. Temperature, twenty- two point two Celsius.
How can you be logical at a time like this?! We have to get thee hell off this planet!
Why?
If I hadn't, it might have been years -- or never!
Whoever they are, they're getting closer.
Mr. Scott...
Mr. Scott, all power to the weapons systems --
Aye, those two hits should stop a horse, let alone a bird.
I'm all right -- stand by to return fire! Mr. Scott, transfer power to the phaser banks --
Mr. Sulu, you're on manual.
Would you look at that?
As surely as if it were my own!  Harry, give me back the Enterprise! With Scotty's help...
You're right.  Thanks for the drink.
There are two more prisoners, Admiral. Do you want them killed too?  Surrender your vessel!
No tricks, Kirk. You have one minute.
Sir. Your son meant more to me than you can know. I'd have given my life if it would have saved his. You must believe me when I tell you that he made no request of me!
What you ask is difficult.
What about Spock?
I am not sure. Only time will answer.  Kirk. I thank you. What you have done is --
So!  Speak!
Perhaps they wish to take you prisoner.
Firing range, sir.
But surely, our mission has not failed -- ?
But dear Lord, are we intelligent enough to -- Suppose, this thing were used where life already exists?
And who am I hiding from?
There may still be time... you gave as good as you got.
Now that's what I call a meal.
Until now.
<u>Will you please be quiet</u>!  Commander Chekov, this is completely irregular. Who gave the order you are quoting? Who gave the order?
Par for the course... you teaming up with me for bridge after dinner?
But the child --
Beyond what I told you, sir, it is classified information.
I'm trying, David.
Careful: Not all at once. <u>The</u> <u>engine room</u>. Lock on target and prepare to fire.
Thirty seconds...
You are in a position to demand nothing, sir. I, on the other hand, am in a position to grant nothing. What you see is all that remains of the ship's company and the crew of the <u>Botany Bay</u>, marooned here fifteen years ago by Captain James T. Kirk.
She's not responding...
Mr. Scott on discrete.
Kirk to Enterprise. Damage report, Spock?
And who is this?
I believe you'll find everything shipshape, Admiral.
They destroyed the simulator room and you with it.
Permission to come aboard, Captain?
I was going to remind you of nothing, least of all that which you know well.  Your mistake, if I may be so bold, was promotion. Commanding a Starship is your first best destiny. Anything else is a waste of material.
It literally is Genesis...
Is it possible their COMM system has failed -- ?
One thing is certain; we cannot escape on auxiliary power.
The prefix code?
Affirmative, Admiral.
I have an urgent CommPic from Space Lab Regula I for the Admiral. Dr. Carol Marcus.
In my quarters, Uhura.
Permission to speak candidly, sir?
Reliant's command...
How?
I changed the conditions of the test. I received a commendation for original thinking.  I don't like to lose.
That was close --
I'll be in my quarters if needed, but I would prefer...
I can't get power, sir!
Phaser lock inoperative, sir.
We're over our heads. Mr. Sulu, get us out of here.
Lieutenant, how many times have you piloted a Starship out of Spacedock?
As you wish, since you deem them of value. But I cannot wait here to find them.
Bob... it's tearing me apart.
He never jokes... Perhaps the professor could use your computer.
You sure this is such a bright idea?
That's crazy!
Oh, joy.
"Guessing" is not in my nature...
What's causing that!?
All right, Commander, you wanna tell us anything?
All right. Let's take it from the top.
The top of what?
No, <u>my</u> name.
Attempting the hell to communicate.
You mean man...
How soon?
He's harmless.  Back in the sixties he was part of the Free Speech movement at Berkeley. I think he did too much LDS.
Wanna try it from the top?
Sorry, that's classified.  I don't really have a clue who you are... You wouldn't want to show me around your space ship, would you?
So. There we are.
It's true... what you said...
It's all real. Look.  The storage tanks for the whales.
They were taken last night. I wasn't told. They're in Alaska by now.
... What does that mean?
It would be improper to refer to you as Jim while you are in command, Admiral... Also, I must apologize for my attire.  I seem to have misplaced my uniform.
Where would we find these reactors... Theoretically.
You've done it before. Can't you remember?
It's her -- from the Institute. If we play our cards right, we may learn when those whales are really leaving.
No word since beam-in. We can only wait for their call.
Estimating Planet Earth one point six hours present speed.
Sir... Braking thrusters seem to have fired.
10,000 M.S.L., Admiral.
I have no control, sir!
Sir -- I've got some back pressure on manual --
283 degrees... 15.2 kilometers...
Any luck...?
I've found Chekov, sir: he's in emergency surgery right now.
Stay with me, sir -- I need more power curve...
I am well, Admiral.
Well, Saavik. I guess this is goodbye.
That's the ticket, laddie.
All right, then this is old stuff to you.
As I recall, I opposed your enlistment in Starfleet... It is possible that judgment was incorrect.  Your associates are people of good character.
But not you.
When time seemed to stop... and you could almost live in that moment...
You're Ro'tin, aren't you...? There's something in the voice.  Would you be his friend Gal'na?  I helped your mother bathe you when you were a child. She still speaks of you.
I play the violin... and my chess routines are quite advanced...
... I am the personification of everything they have rejected.
A ship,
Incomplete, I might add.
That's probably not a good idea. Your ship hasn't been fitted for this region; there are environmental concerns...
I wish I had better news. Commander Data attacked us in the mission scout ship yesterday. Ru'afo and I have decided to send in an assault team...
How can there be an order to abandon the Prime Directive...?
Right. We have the planet and they have the technology -- a technology we can't duplicate. You know what that makes us? Their partners.
What you're asking me to do... is impossible... the crew is loyal to Ru'afo...
They're following the kelbonite deposits... using the interference to block our transporters...
So, you're saying he still knew the difference between right and wrong.
In a sense, that's all he knew. The system is designed to protect him against anyone who might try to take advantage of his memory loss.
... had regenerated.
Options?
I wouldn't be surprised if history remembers this as the Riker Maneuver...
No, we're here to... rescue them.
I... I must have slept through my alarm. I'm on my way...
Worf to Picard...
He might be using the planet's rings to mask his approach.
Scanners are off line!
The damping sequencer was damaged by phaser fire!
Can you beam him off?
I don't see anything to suggest the Son'a have any interest in sociology...
No children?
... I believe you...
What I need, I can't get from Doctor Crusher...  Counselor, do you think it's possible for two people to go back in time to fix a mistake they've made?
Are you saying they won't help us?
You think they're still up there?
The occipital fracture is widening... we're going to have to fuse the bones...
I do not know what you are referring to.
It would appear that you are attempting to graft organic skin onto my endo-skeletal structure.
No. I will not betray my friends.
That is not true. They have tried to help me.
Isn't it better like this...?
Vulcan?
It has entered Earth orbit.  Correction -- it is not in orbit. It is heading directly toward the surface.
What year is it?
Mister Data, I want to know the exact date and time.  Give me a damage report on that missile silo.
Did you know her?
I told you, there's no --
Captain, I'm starting to worry about the hull integrity. We've been running the support field at full power for three hours straight. I don't know how much longer it's going to hold up.
This must be it.
Alphanumeric lock. We need a password to get in...
Blast door. It's designed to protect the control room when the missile is launched.
Always am.
Captain... we've got less than ten minutes before that Vulcan ship leaves the system. We've got to go <U>now</U>.
Their com system must still be down.
It'll be tight, but we should make it.
I've enhanced the plasma injectors -- don't worry, they'll see it.
ATR setting...
Oh...  yes... ultraviolet protection. Thank you. Mister...?
That was a pretty clever trick you did with the hospital's batteries. How'd you do it?
I'm an old friend of Cochrane's... I wanted to see how he was doing.
Okay, let's hear it. I'm sure you have a great explanation for why those rocket photos are so important you broke into my house.
Why are you being so difficult? All I'm asking for is to look at one of the photographs. It'll take five minutes.
No. It's a lot further than that.
It's the future, isn't it? Just like you told Scrimm.  I knew you weren't from around here.
No... I'm from France.
Why?
This may be hard for you to understand... but I'm duty-bound not to interfere with you, or anyone else here... any more than is absolutely necessary.
Captain...?
Port battery, ready sir!
Intercept course, full impulse.  Weapons status?
Target locked!
Yes, sir. But Captain... are we... all going back?
Are you alright?
To do what? If they wanted a weapon, they could've taken over a phaser bank or torpedo bay...
Worf? Is something wrong?
They may be trying to send a message to the other Borg...the Borg in this time period...
Bet you wish you'd stood in bed...
Can you - ?
Thanks...
That was the general idea I intended to convey.
Are we playing multiple choice?
No more neutral zone. I was USED to hating Klingons... that's why I failed in our assignment.  It never even occurred to me to take Gorkon at his word. Spock was right.
What is it with you, anyway?
What kind of creature is this? Last night you two were spooning -
Perhaps with a few small steps at a time. Like this one.
"To be or not to be, that is the question" which preoccupies our people, Captain Kirk. We need BREATHING room...
And you still maintain your ship did not fire on Kronos One? Would you have known if she had? Come now, Captain. The record clearly there were no other ships in the sector.
For insubordination.
Captain, if they fire at us with our shields down --
Shields. Battle stations.
Mr. Chekov, take us forward, thrusters only, one half impulse power...
Course heading, Captain?
Do we report this, sir?
Chancellor. We've been ordered to escort you through Federation space to your meeting place on Earth.
How much time's left of your sentence?
I know how to get outside the shield.
Possibly.
I can't make it alone. You're the likeliest candidate to come to this god-forsaken place in months.
Captain, if --
Aft thrusters -
Kronos, sir?
Who is "US?"
This is Captain Sulu, USS Excelsior.
Surely not.
I have personally vouched for you in this matter, Captain.
There's an old Vulcan proverb: only Nixon could go to China.
I am responsible for involving you in this. I will go.
Close enough to beam down?
Gorkon's own man??
You must have faith.
Curious. You haven't been assisting Commander Uhura with her radio transmissions, have you, Lt?
Suppose when they returned they threw the boots into the garbage?
If you are logical.
But it was when you tried to persuade me the Captain was guilty that I should have understood.
Direct hit -
What?
You having hearing problems, mister?
Don't tell me that was any meteor shower.
I have confirmed the location, sir, but...
Praxis?
They dinna fire on themselves. And there were no other ships present.
If another ship had been beneath us the Klingons would've seen her!
I assume command of this ship as of  0130 hours. Uhura, send to Starfleet HQ. Explain precisely what has taken place, and request instructions.
Sulu's giving us his position and telling us he's standing by...
Can you tell me how you came to be on the planet where we found you?
Fuzzy face is gone.
Do you have any knowledge of the tactical abi1ities of this ship?
I notice Dr. Crusher laughing along with the rest of you. As most of you know, the doctor will also soon be leaving the Enterprise, to assume command of Starfleet Medical. Again, I'm forced to ask, Beverly, have you considered what you're doing to little ole me?! I'll probably get some old battle-axe of a doctor who'll tell me to eat my vegetables and put me on report if I dont show up for my physical on time!
So... To happy endings.
Data to Captain Picard. Geordi and I have identified the source of the unauthorized computer access. And, I believe, we have also discovered an opportunity to gain a tactical advantage.
What do you imagine this is?
Do you think this is a wise course of action?
We're about to find out... Power up disruptors and fire on my mark.
He'd have all your memories too. You feel comfortable with that?
What purpose does this serve?
You're speaking of emotional investment?
How could I not?
Shinzon's Viceroy seems to have the ability to reach into my thoughts. I've become a liability... I request to be relieved of my duties.
What do we know about the planet?
Uncharted. We'll have to get closer for a more detailed scan.
I read six distinct positronic signatures, spread out over a few kilometers on the surface.
Cannon fodder.
Set up a security program to detect any unusual data stream rerouting. If it happens again, we want to be ready.
Geordi, put 211 power to the engines.  Take it from life support if you have to -- everything you can give me.
With or without the rest of the fleet?

What are you doing to Counsellor Troi?
I'm picking up an unusual electromagnetic signature from the Kolarin system.
To find the head, sir?
Tactical analysis, Mister Worf.
Sir --
Captain, you have an Alpha Priority communication from Starfleet Command.
He wasn't designed to live a complete, human life span.
When your first officer insists that you can't go on away missions... Ignore him.
Right now, youre thinking this all sounds too good to be true?
Come to dinner on Romulus tomorrow. Just the two of us. Or just the one of us.
Romulan ale -- I'm surprised. I can't stand it.
For thousands of years the Romulan Senate has met in this chamber and dictated the fate of its sister-planet... But the time has come for us to live as equals.
And I'm not quite human. So what am I? What do you see?  Do you see a life you might have led? Lost youth never to be recaptured?
To accept your surrender. I can clearly destroy you at any time. Lower your shields and allow me to transport you to my ship.
Long ago.
You can still make a choice! Make the right one now!
They're holding position.
The Scimitar will serve my needs.
Right in line with that burning tree.
Thank you.
What can I do for you folks?
Hey, that sounds interesting. You like it?
Make any money?
Do you have children?
What do you think of America?
Well, here we are... You go down that ramp there, you're sure to get a ride.
No!!! No!!!
That's not going to happen, George, unless you get us the help you promised us.
We've been back and forth on this all day and keeping in mind the panic that would occur if this got to the general public, it's been decided not to expand the search at this time.
Don't let them do it this way, George. It's too important. We can't find this thing alone.
Why did you let it get into a populated area?
It's taken on a disguise.
The extraterrestrial now looks like this.
I don't like it, George...
I'll make this as simple as I can, George. They disappeared.
I'm not being unpatriotic, and I'm doing my damndest to catch them. Bell's up on 80 and I'm down here on 70 past Grand Junction. They're heading west. If they're not flying we have a damn good chance of getting them. All I'm asking is that you people think about it.
I won't let anyone hurt you.
Which way?
What?
I am husband?
Attendant. He'll give us gas. Put the gun down. Under the seat. Under the seat...
In your pocket, please...
You. Mouth closed.
A drink.
I need you.
No.
Why?
Will you please do it my way? You'll get into trouble if you don't. If anybody talks to you, tell them... I do not speak English.
Why did your ship land on this planet... on Earth?
Hello... hello. How are you this morning?
But...
I will say that we can be friends.
Call the police!!
You sure this is your car?
Pull over. I've got to get back there.
I have nothing to do. I'd like to help you.
Is it for real?
Jesus Lyman, you're an ignorant fool.
After I called in, I had a chance to sit down with the three locals. They swear there's another one that didn't make the ship... It might be alive.
Listen to this.  A woman was kidnapped in Eau Claire this morning. When a citizen went to her rescue the kidnapper threatened him with a gun and shouted at him in a strange 'clicking gibberish'...
Yeah, thanks. We appreciate that.
I saw you play, man.  You were good. Like a fucking freight train I remember saying.  So what happened, injuries or what?
Maybe now you appreciate the danger we're in.  It was touching the way you stood by me in there.  "Stand by your man". I was moved.  You were very good.  I don't think he even understands that you did it for him.
Fuck you.
You were supposed to go downstairs, baby.
Hey, you going to watch or you going to do?
Well I haven't seen her in months. Who knows what's going on in her head.  You're really running out of excuses to come around, aren't you?
I know you Faith.  You're afraid of something.  What's going on?
What's going on?
How did it happen?  What was Iris doing riding around with Jeriko wearing a wire?
Just what I've read.  That the technology was developed for the Feds, to replace the body wire.  And now it's gone black market.  So, uh, do I get the deck from you?
That's right.  Clips.  Look, I want you to know what we're talking about here.  This isn't like TV only better.  This is life.  It's a piece of somebody's life.  Pure and uncut, straight from the cerebral cortex.  You're there. You're doing it, seeing it, hearing it... feeling it.
What kind of things exactly?
D'you always have to dress like a fuckin' pimp?
That's not sayin' much.
See, if you packed your piece you could've made the guy see sense.
Fairly twisted logic, Max, even for you.  Hey, at least you got a job!  Watch her for me.  Stay on her.
Not now... I don't want to think about it--
Come on, Lenny.  You used to be good at this stuff.  Play it down. What's the perp doing?
He's been cooked-off
Mace... no disrespect... but you run this on the 11 o'clock news, by midnight you got the biggest riot in history.  They'll see the fucking smoke from Canada.
Give him the tape.  See?  It's fucking brilliant!  The tape for Faith.  I know he'll go for it.  I can set it up.
This is what we laughingly refer to as a plan, right?
I'll have that.  Glock 22.  Nice.
Buncha techno-perv jerkoffs.
Uh huh, I wanna hear this part.
Price he pays for being a scumsucking pig.
What the fuck are you doing?
Macey... I've never seen you like this.
Jesus, Lenny.
I have crawled through the gutter... through every wrinkle in the human brain.
So the guy's not a sicko.
Lenny, give them the tape.
Shit!
Bullet resistant?  Whatever happened to bullet proof?
Tell me.
We got to make another copy of this. Little life insurance.
You know what this tape could do if it gets out.
Yeah.  You gave up your hot tub tape to save me.  That's real progress for you.
You never told me.
But she was different.  There was a light in her eyes... and she had this voice.  It was scary, all that pain coming out of that little body. Like she could take all the hurt and rage of the entire world and lift it up to heaven in one voice.  I helped her.  And I promised her that I'd always be there... to protect her.  See?  It's not about what's in her head.  It's what's in mine.  I can't let go of the promise.  It's... like... it's all I have left.
And do what?  Take on his whole posse?
Fine.  Do you want blood running waist deep in the storm drains?  The gangbangers'll spread like a wave through this city and burn it to the ground.  And when the fires start the street cops'll be capping off at anything that moves.  It'll be all- out war and you know it.
Fella's name is Harold Speck, travelin' man out of Roswell.
Oh Jesus, Sheriff, I am sorry. I meant to call you -- I got distracted -- the Sumpter girl was not one of Speck's victims. That's the good news.
Show's over, boys. Nobody home.
Sheriff Dylan, this is FBI Agent Thomas Mackelway. Remember me?
I'm sorry. This won't take long.
The body was embalmed. I don't understand --
You must travel a lot, huh?
About your being away all the time. Must get lonely.
Calm down, Harold.  Okay, here's what we're going to do, Harold: there's a pull off up ahead, we're going to stop there.
Oh God, mister, please leave me alone.
The man who was with him, he was a construction worker?
What about his killer?
Another what?
I'll relay this to CIIAC.
Let some by-the-book J. Edgar Agents go into the chat room, spook these guys with stupid questions, blow my cover? -- no way.
I was lucky to find, much less crack, the address code -- no way to be sure I could have done it again.
You didn't like anyone looking over your shoulder -- why was that? What were you doing?
Had trouble sleeping last night, sir.
Have you told Richard Low about Amarillo?
You are so fucked up.
Setting up. Technically, anyone in a chat room can be traced back to a screen address. But, by using punters, a correspondent literally punts his address around the world, through computers in countries that have no communication treaties. The correspondent becomes "ghosted," invisible.
What about the chat rooms themselves?
They're all criminals?
What's that?
None. Can't find a thing. Nothing on file, nothing online. It's not a part of any known killer's signature.
You must really think I'm a square, a computer nerd.
There are Agency regulations about this.
Then there's the other issue.
I met with Richard Low.  These are names of missing persons he has flagged. I'm double-checking every case, but I don't want to be too obvious about it. I marked the ones I'd like you to work on.
Burn marks. The original M.E. listed it as "burn residue." Same place, the outer thigh, as Karen Sumpter. The UNSUB is able to abduct, kill, transport and bury without detection.
It's a truck. A refrigerated truck.
This is Richard Low. Stay on the phone. Do not disconnect. I'm watching you. I will instruct you where to drive.
I've been reading, hearing about you. I spoke to Koessler, Professor Daitz.
Of course not. They're possibles. I've checked them against Bureau records, check them against your file. How did you get it?
Lead the way, Murman.
If I owe, I will go.
[Don't jerk a jerk-off. There's nothing in the Bureau mainframe.]
I want to go live with you.
I screwed up twice, sir.
This is a first. You criticized the Deputy Director to his face and you still have a badge? You must have some one-of-a-kind skills.  Why don't you just quit? I mean, you're not going to get promoted, not wearing this jacket.
Speck is dead.
I'm Agent Thomas Mackelway, FBI. There is no way you will escape. Assistant Deputy Director Richard Low is en route with another Agent.  You may know Low by another name. You may know him by the name Murman. I am Lionheart.
Murman!
He's a brilliant man. Brilliant enough to catch you.
Moving here from New York was much more of an adjustment than this.
Are you calling Her?
Don't do it, Mike.
What do you drive?
...Monday nights? I host an open mike...
Yeah.
I'd say about two weeks.
Well, thank you...?
Nikki.
How was it hard?
Oh, God. That's two more than me. Tell me it gets better.
It does.
Uh, if the guy wants to.
No... Maybe that's not the case. Maybe she shouldn't be such a smug little shit because she'd be surprised at what a good dancer he really is, but it's been a long time and he doesn't know if he's ready to...
Can I get you something else? I mean, you shouldn't leave without getting something for free.
You have to lay it on the table.
Who's your booking agent?
Didn't you tell me to be patient with my career?
...It's really getting late.
Yeah, hold on.
Good.  I think about things.
Yeah?
I couldn't. Do you know how hard it's been not to call you? I pick up the phone every night. Whenever that commercial comes on...
So I don't call either way.
There's the rub.
There's just something about being "Goofy". Any other Disney character would be fine. There's just this stigma associated with the character.
I don't talk about her that much.
I shouldn't, Mike, it's a weeknight.
It's unbelievable.
I got to at least try once.
Pause it. 
Yeah. Here it's easier to avoid trouble. It's not like you like in Compton where bullets are whizzing by your head every day. Nobody's mugging you on no subway. In New York the trouble finds you. Out here you gotta go look for it...
What are they doing here?
Mike?
Listen to me, baby, there are going to be beautiful babies there.
What?
Don't give me that shit. You know exactly how much you lost. What'd you drop?
You think so?
It's just that I've been out of the game so long. Trent, I was with her for six years. That's before AIDS. I'm scared. I don't know how to talk to them, I don't know...
Baby, relax. It's just down the hall. She's gotta change... we'll be fine.
Oh... a Dorothy.
Wait... Wait... Just "Brother". So I go in. "Hello... Hi... We loved your guest spot on Baywatch... blah blah blah..." Whatever. So, I start to read, and, Mikey, I was money. I prepared for a week. It's a starring role. I'm crying... The casting director, she starts crying...
Baby, you take yourself out of the game. You start talking about puppy dogs and ice cream, of course it's gonna be on the friend tip.
I just don't think she liked me in that way.
That's just plain silly. Your self- esteem is just low because she's with someone else. But thinking about it and talking about it all the time is bad. It's no good, man. You gotta get out there. The ladies want to love you, baby.
...a day...
What are you doing?
You're not just, like, fucking with me?
Now?
No.
Yes she did.
...you're money...
...Anaheim...
It is on.
You don't have to wait three days...
What do you want of me?  I'll give you anything you want, but do what I ask!
Be my friend.
Godfather.
The food is on the table.
You filthy guinea spoiled brat. Clean it up or I'll kick your head in.
Go get Paulie, I don't care how sick he is.  Pick him up yourself, and bring him to my father's house.
Then in a six month time we're on our own; is that it?
You look terrif on the floor!
What percentages for my family?
Thirty per cent.  In the first year your share would be four million dollars; then it would go up.
No...how a man makes his living is none of my business.  But this proposition of yours is too risky. All the people in my family lived well the last ten years, I won't risk that out of greed.
No.
Is it necessary?
I'm going to finish school.
I told you that it wouldn't escape his eye.
I see you have your Luca Brasi.
Your wife and children...you're happy with them?
The younger men have no respect. Things are changing; I don't know what will happen.  Michael, because of the wedding, people now know your name.
Is that why there are more men on the walls?
We hear.  We were told you were a Pezzonovanta...big shot.
You look wonderful, kid; really wonderful.  That doctor did some job on your face.
Ever seen anything like that before?
The old man wants you; Johnny's here...he's got a problem.
Oh Christ Tom, I didn't mean it that way.
Part of the deal: Bruno cancels out what they did to my father.
Yes, even the shooting of your father was business, not personal...
I've tried calling and writing.  I want to reach Michael.
The Don was slipping; in the old days I could never have gotten to him.  Now he's dead, nothing can bring him back.  Talk to Sonny, talk to the Caporegimes, Clemenza and Tessio...it's good business.
Even Sonny won't be able to call off Luca Brasi.
I'll worry about Luca.  You take care of Sonny and the other two kids.
He never asks a second favor when he has been refused the first. Understood?
I'm German-Irish.
Sure.  Anything I can do for you.
You really want to know?
Then Luca turned to the other man...
If he's your brother, why does he have a different name?
Michael?
I'm thinking about it.
Visiting hour ends at eight thirty. I'll just sit with him; I want to show respect.
I don't think so either.  I better go.
When will I see you again?
Oh Michael.
No, you eat...don't wait up for me.
All right, this one time I'll let you ask about my affairs, one last time.
You cannot stay here...I'm sorry.
What?
Barzini's people chisel my territory and we do nothing about it.  Pretty soon there won't be one place in Brooklyn I can hang my hat.
Do you recognize my voice?
Right.  Don't say my name, just listen.  Somebody shot your father outside his place fifteen minutes ago.
You should come and have lunch with us, before you go -- Dickie?
Sorry, sorry, sorry. I know, I'm late, I'm a swine.
Did you forget where I live? It's four o'clock.
You'd say if you mind?
Shut up.
Who's this?
Well, I knew you, so I suppose you must have known me.
Stop! It's too much! You're making all the hairs on my neck stand up!
No, I think your mother, her illness --
It's got nothing to do with my mother! She's had leukemia for -- ! This is what makes me boil about him! HE wants me back! -- it's got nothing to do with my mother.
You like jazz!
Good afternoon!
Sure. I love Venice.
And Rome.
Pretty vile. See this: The S and the T, do you see? -- fine, vulnerable -- that's pain, that's secret pain.
I can't. I can't keep spending your father's money.
What club?
You said I could pick out a jacket and I just... Sorry.
You've been so good to me. You're the brother I never had. I'm the brother you never had.
She came to me for help, she needed money, and I didn't help her. I didn't help her. Now she's dead and it's my fault.
You can't blame him. You could hardly expect this to go on forever.
Of course. Let's say, for argument's sake, you were here -- perhaps we could split the rent on a house -- I'll get a job -- or, better still, I could get a place in Rome and when we're there we could be there and if we're here we could be here --
You see, particularly with the Marge problem, you can just blame me.
No, no, it's not a threat, I've explained all of that.
What evening?
He's gone to dinner! Search the place. I can't think why you would imagine Dickie would hide from you.
You should watch that!
Freddie, do you have something to say?
I suggest you ask Dickie that yourself. Otello's is on delle Croce, just off the Corso.
Mr Greenleaf.
I'm well, thank you.
I feel guilty. I feel like I pushed him away. I spoke and he heard you.
Marge has been telling us about the rings.
We could go down to the bar -- no need for you to --
I was sure we'd met, weren't you, Ted? This is Herbert Greenleaf's boy.
Is Mr Greenleaf here?
Pleasure to meet you, Dickie's made a fine catch. I know Emily thinks so.
Frances?
So I'm learning.
Did Dickie's Dad go?
He promised me. I swear I'll never take off this ring until the day --
I told you. He gave them to me.
It's all true.
Dickie? Do you know Dickie?
I told you! I knew it!
This is spectacular.
Excuse me?
The funny thing is, I'm not Randall either. I'm Logue.
But you're going skiing with us Yankees, aren't you?
Let's take a Carozza and look at the moon.
Otherwise you'd be fighting me off.
Hello Meredith.
Well, you've spotted me and so you get the reward.
Ditto.
Not at all. Morning Tom.
No, but I thought that didn't happen in Italy, that each region was completely separate! I was sure that was the --
No.  By the way, officially there are no Italian homosexuals. Makes Leonardo, Michelangelo very inconvenient.
Don't you put the past in a room, in the cellar, and lock the door and just never go in there? Because that's what I do.
I'm fine.
Tom. Tom! Tell me, what's going on?
Plans -- good, plans for tonight or plans for the future?
Was that Meredith?
Yes?
I can't be absolutely sure -- 8? 9? We'd both taken on far too many drinks -- but it was dark, it was certainly dark when I walked him down to his car.
Can we go up? Do you mind?
And when did you last see Signor Ripley?
A few days ago.
Thank you.
Some of these guns are like toys, but a Smith and Wesson, man, you can hit somebody over the head with it and it will still come back dead on. Nothing beats quality.  You interested in an automatic?
How much for everything.
Well, you're talking big money now. I'd say at least five grand, maybe more, and it would take a while to check it out. The way things are going now $5.000 is probably low. You see, I try not to fool with the small-time crap. Too risky, too little bread. Say 6 G's, but if I get the permit it'll be as solid as the Empire State Building.
Huh?
Charles Palantine. The man you want to volunteer to help elect president.
Well, then, what is it you exactly want to do?
It's just to the corner, mam. In broad daytime. Nothing can happen. I'll be there to protect you.
You're right! Now I remember! It was after the Western regional planners were in town and the meeting went late. The next day I was completely bushed. It was unbelievable.
That's very romantic. Some of your fares must be interesting. See any stars, politicians, deliver any babies yet?
I bought a couple of tickets.
Well, I don't follow movies too much...
What about the record?
No, I didn't forget "sexy".
I'm great. Always set my fingers on fire. If you want to see another trick. I do this thing with my nose.
Awh, come off it, Pal.
That's fine.
Threw on the emergency, jumped the seat and fucked her brains out -- What do you think!  What do I have to do? Draw you a picture?
Well, you ever need one, I know a feller that kin getcha a real nice deal. Lotsa shit around.
For a fee.
...he called up the Dispatcher last night. Charlie McCall, our dispatcher...
I can leave anytime I want.
That's not hard to do.
No, I mean really. This is nothing for a person to do.
Why do you want me to go back to my parents? They hate me. Why do you think I split? There ain't nothin there.
God, you are square.
Who's a killer?
He never killed nobody. He's a Libra.
I'm a Libra too. That's why we get along so well.
How?
Why, thank you Travis.
Oh?
I'm no cop.  I want some action.
Shit.
O.K., cowboy.
Yeah, Iris. You know anybody by that name?
Neither do I, I guess.
Don't worry, Killer. You'll be all right.  I seen enough to know.
Had a close one.
Don't stop...  do no stop.
Just come and get me, sir.  I'm tired.
Motor oil?
I'll go.
You knew?  All this time?
I believe you.
The truth is, I'm a lot of things, but communist isn't one of them.
You'll be fine.  No matter what Leo Kubelsky says, you've got a hundred and seventy-five years of American law on your side.  Don't forget that.
Did you bring along something to read?
Yeah, well it's not everyday you get  news like this.  You're sure he's  okay?  Other than the  bump on the head?
Well...
What.
I do?
Have you always wanted to be a lawyer?
We were in love... weren't we?
Do you have the...
What?
Nine hundred...
You had a hidden agenda, though. See, when he was five or six, little Spence used to follow you around like a puppy.  Bothered the hell out of you.  But as soon as you gave him the clarinet...
... he started practicing, and he left me alone from then on.
Thanks.
Yes, sir.
Yes... yes, I do.
Referring to line thirty-seven of the document, does your printed name and signature appear there?
Mr. Appleton, please tell this committee what was the nature and purpose of the "Bread Instead of Bullets Club?"
All right, Mr. Appleton.  That was what you knew then.  What do you know now?
The chair notes that you are appearing without the benefit of counsel today, Mr. Appleton.  We certainly hope this means that you intend to be fully forthcoming with this committee?
I'll do my best, Mr. Chairman.
Now, we're informed that you have a statement you'd like to read, is that correct?
Mr. Appleton?  Mr. Appleton?
I... I need a drink of water.
Only one in town.  Get in, son.
Doc, with your permission, I want to bring someone in here.  Maybe it'll jar this young man's memory.
Are you saying that he's...
Tomorrow afternoon...  ... oh my god...
But what?
Well, he loves the place.  It's his home.
We've been closed for a while.
Hmmmm... after you left, it was difficult, and then Lily -- that's your mother -- she took ill and died... we haven't shown a picture since forty-eight.
Carl.  Friend of yours from high school.  Everybody calls him "Cueball."
I'll be home in a little while, Harry.  Don't wait up.
Luke... what time is it?
Did I what?
That's where you live.
Uh, no... just seeing you standing there, it reminded me... there's a word for it...
It's a pretty massive heart attack. His lungs have filled with fluid, and, well... it seems as though his body is just... shutting down.
Huh?
What?  That I'm accused of being a communist when I don't happen to be one?
Yeah, well, that's enough.
"Ashes To Ashes?"
Exactly.
Kid, you gave them what they wanted.  This committee, it feeds on names.  The more names, the better.  But for some high-profile witnesses, like yourself, any name will do.
You should keep track of your old school chums.  Turns out she eventually joined the communist party.  On top of which, she's Lucy Angstrom Hirschfeld now, and she happens to be a writer for "Studio One" on CBS.
So I guess this fellow belongs to you.  What's his name?
Cat.
Please, sit.
Oh...
What exactly did you hear?
Well... something like that.  I'm sorry. I don't mean to sound so mysterious.
Mmm.  Well, good luck, Miss Daniels.
Oh, hi!  Did you find her all right?
I guess you knew that, anyway.
When was this?
And what had you done?
Annie, that adds up to a jealous, possessive woman.
No, I don't think so. She's not afraid of losing her son, you see.  She's only afraid of being abandoned.
I can understand his position. He went through a lot with Lydia after his father died. He didn't want to risk going through it all over again.
I'll be going, too, to help out. It should be fun, Melanie.
Well, Mom, he's the first to admit it.  He spends half his day in the detention cells at the Hall of Justice.
Mother!
Mitch, can I bring the lovebirds in here?
They're beautiful! They're just what I wanted! Is there a man and a woman? I can't tell which is which.
I don't think so.  I have to get back to San Francisco.
Mitch likes it very much. He comes up every weekend, you know, even though he has his own apartment in the city. He says San Francisco is just an ant hill at the foot of a bridge.
I guess it does get a little hectic at times.
What?
I'm looking for a man named Mitchell Brenner.
Well, I ain't positive, if that's what you mean.
I didn't even know there were many crows in Bodega Bay this time of year.
What happened?
Young woman cut herself.
Gulls!
Let me have some apple pie, Helen.  Who said anything about war? All I said was that some gulls...
For Cathy. For her birthday. By the way, where is she?
Across at Brinkmeyer's.
Yes, very.
Forgive me. I suppose I'm just naturally curious about a girl like that.  She's very rich, isn't she?
I suppose so. Her father owns a big newspaper in San Francisco.
She is the one who jumped into that fountain in Rome last summer, isn't she?
It's none of my business, of course, but when you bring a girl like that to...
Not now.  Not while they're massing out there.
I don't know. We'll break up the furni...
No.
I miss him.  You know, sometimes I wake up in the morning, and I think 'I have to make Frank's breakfast,' and I... I get up and there's a... a very good reason for getting out of bed until... until, of course, I remember.  I miss talking to him.  Cathy's a child, you know, and Mitch...  ...Mitch has his own life.  I'm glad he stayed here today. I feel safer with him here. 
Why, Mrs. Brenner?
I wish I were stronger.  Do you think she's all right? Do you think she's safe at the school?
Would you? I'd feel so much better.
Well, these birds live in chimneys, you know.
'Cause sometimes birds are attracted by light, you know.  Sure is a peculiar thing.
All right, I'll grant you a bird'll panic in an enclosed room. But, they didn't just get in. They came in! Right down that chimney.
What?
Yes, what was it you were looking for, sir?
The sign says strawberry finches.
Those are canaries, Miss.  Doesn't this make you feel awful?
Doesn't what make me...?
Oh, certainly. It's to protect the species.
I don't know you.
How?
What kind of law?
You like me, huh?
You are, aren't you?
With... with Annie, of course.
He was watching a ball game on television.
Oh. That. Rome.
Mmmm. I like to swim. We might get along very...
Yes.
Like jumping into a fountain in Rome!
I really shouldn't have any more. I'm a little tipsy already.
Cheers.
And Fridays? What do you do then?
Are you all right?
You look a little shaken.
I... I am.  Mitch, is... Mitch, this isn't usual, is it? The gull yesterday when I was in the boat, and the one last night at Annie's, and now...
A gull smashed into Annie's front door.  Mitch... what's happening?
No, I have my things in the car.
It smelled of the fire.
It all started several months ago with a peasant sparrow up in the hills, a malcontent. He went around telling all the other sparrows that human beings weren't fit to rule this planet, preaching wherever anyone would listen...
Hear!
It's so damn quiet out there.
It was like that yesterday.
I'm frightened, Mitch.
I'm frightened and confused and I... I think I want to go back to San Francisco where there are buildings and... and concrete and...
I got here as fast as I could. Where's Cathy?
The bay doesn't.
I tried a little while ago. The phone's dead.
Santa Rosa?
Almost two a.m.
We'd better light some of those lamps.
Can we turn back?
Certainly not. Oh, no. Certainly not. This will be a full grown myna bird. Full grown.
Well, yes, he'll talk. Well, no, no. You'll have to teach him to talk.
Yes.
Hello, may I speak to Mitch Brenner, please?  Yes, I'll wait.
Yes, all right, I'll wait for you. Good-by. 
I hardly think a few birds are going to bring about the end of the world.
Sebastian, I'm not an alarmist.
I'm not sure, but...
How do you plan to do that?
Birds?
Not if they're starting a war.
Actually, those gulls must have been after the fish.
Something like this happened in Santa Cruz last year. The town was covered with seagulls.
You're over-excited, Mistress Cameron.
Aye.
She came again today.  She wanted me to ask you if you would not break your rule and operate.  She feels you are her only hope.
It was about last night I wanted to talk to you -- about the operation on the little Marsh girl.
I can't believe that.
Did you think Gray was the only one who could handle a mattock and shovel?  I've had some practice in the art.
What you really want to ask me is about my back, isn't it -- about where it hurts?
Not much danger here, ma'am, I wouldn't think -- right here in the heart of Edinburgh.
They're uncommon bold, the grave robbers -- and the daft doctors who drive them on.
Don't call me that confounded name.
Afraid of what?
I'll not do it, Gray.
No.
You know something about the human body, Gray.
I've never had it all explained that way to me by so learned a man.
And you're a fool, Toddy -- and no doctor. It's only the dead ones that you know.
Like Knox taught you? Like I taught you? In cellars and graveyards? Did Knox teach you what makes the blood flow?
But what makes a thought start?
What are you going here? Have I not told you --
Have another glass of something good, Toddy.
What I was going to say is this -- wouldn't you be more comfortable at Leith in a neat little house?
I want to speak to you alone.  I saw something.  I heard.
You mean we would sell the bodies to the doctors together? Dig them up?
"The ruffian dogs, the Hellish pair.  The villain Burke, the meager Hare --"
No, Doctor.  She seemed to get better, then about six months later she began to complain of pain in her back --
It comes at intervals.  They used to be months apart -- but they've been growing more frequent --  much more frequent.
Child seems to take to the lad. What sort of an accident was it, Ma'am?
A carriage overturned.  My husband was killed and Georgina was hurt.
There's nothing I can say for one small child?
She would if she could.
You're not going to Gray.
around, or whatever the hell you're doing here.  What are you doing here?
You think I'm crazy.
We're getting there. Because in his so-called construction job, Tommy makes a daily delivery to a place called "The Hole."
Where the fuck did you come from?
What did they give you?
What Scar? What fucking scar?
Are you out of your fucking mind? We're going to die.
You're him. Corvis.
No...
This tree. Here's where it happened.
Erlich gimping around in his goddamn hot rod is not discreet. I've got reporters asking me how much he made. I've got the entire force looking at this case now.
Some hooker phoned it in. There was a riot at his apartment yesterday.
An accident, Nathan.
She's... sick.  Actually she never had Mai Tais before.
As though unsure of what he's heard) Yes -- yes, I have.
In the hands of a mature civilization, these would not be considered weapons of aggression. But in the hands of your people--  We've observed your aggressive tendencies, and we don't trust you with such power.
It is not enough to have men of science. We scientists are too easily ignored -- or misunderstood. We must get important men from every field. Educators -- philosophers -- church leaders -- men of vision and imagination -- the finest minds in the world.
Did you and Mr. Carpenter really go to see Professor Barnhardt?
What do you mean, dear?
Bobby--! What are you doing up at this hour?
I followed Mr. Carpenter -- right after you left -- and, gee, Mom, where do you think he went? Right into the space ship!
Sure. Right near where my mother works.
No. It's for a lot of other things, too.
Bobby -- I have an idea. Let's go see Professor Barnhardt and find out how he talks.
You're just kidding, aren't you?
The President asked me to convey his deepest apologies for what has happened. We all feel--
It's rather difficult for us to think of another planet as a neighbor.
I was only hoping to make you understand.
I will not speak to any one nation or group of nations.  I don't intend to add my contribution to your childish jealousies and suspicions.
There's only one thing -- I haven't been able to arrange for anyone to stay with Bobby.  I don't suppose we could take him with us?
Bobby and I have had enough excitement for tonight.
I've got some terrific news about your friend, Mr. Carpenter.
Never mind about that.  You've got to promise me you won't say a word to anybody.
We'll miss you very much -- Bobby and I.  He won't have anyone to play with.
The Professor's secretary says she found you in Barnhardt's room, making marks on his blackboard.
That's right.
I suppose you know that Barnhardt does a lot of secret work for the Army.
Just passing through Santa Carla?
We don't ride with vampires.
Okay.  Where's Nosferatu?
Those two we brought back with us. The girl and the kid.  I don't trust 'em.  I say we terminate 'em while we can.
We still going?
And these Archies should be over here with the Richie Rich's.
What's that smell!?
What?
No, Nanook!  Quiet!
David.
Dad!  Don't sneak up on people like that!
Did we have a date tonight?
It was a dream, Star.
Okay?
Lights out, Sam.
There's nothing wrong with Max.  I don't know why you don't --
Ohmygod...
Mom!
So what can I help you find tonight, Lucy?  We've got it all.  Best selection in Santa Carla.
-- a job.
You're thinking of the groom not seeing the bride before the wedding.
Well, I...
Okay.  Talk.
Hi...
No.  They've made me one of them, but I miss my family.
It's not too late for you to be saved... but each night... it becomes harder and harder for me to resist killing...
I know, I've felt it...
Mom's home?...
Michael?
What??
Star.
What was he doing in the rec room?
Look, I know it's hard to believe...
Anybody sick?
Nobody's getting in here.  You can tell them all that!
... Can't you see...?  If one cell of this Thing got out it could imitate every living thing on Earth. Nothing could stop it!  Nothing!
I don't know who to trust.
Let's open it.
Let's open it.  Now...
I said where?  Where'd you go?!
What's happening?
The dogs?
Look, I'm just guessing...
What do we do about those three?
Load of bullshit.
Maybe we shouldn't make it.
Well, who's got access to it?
I guess you're okay.
In this weather?
How long will it take you to prepare this?
Don't let up, Childs!
How long's it been?
Four!
What kind of test?
Where were the flashlights?
We've got to find Fuchs.  When we find him -- we kill him.
What about Childs?
MacReady...?
... Thousands and thousands of people.  And sometimes we live in great buildings that reach up five or ten stories.
How can they just go back to work as if nothing happened?
There's a place that might help... we could try going there.
But you're only a mud carrier.
... Well, you wanted to see it.
This is it?
Morlocks --
Excuse me?
Yes.
When was his mother taken?
What?
My God... I saw this.
Yes.
Yes... Are you sure you want to do this?
This has to end.
No, we created the Morlocks.
They survived above.  Became what they are.
No... they didn't survive only to be your food.  You did that.
So you take their best...
You took her because she helped me.
And why not?
I -- what are you?!
Sorry... I was distracted.
Admiration?  My my.
Dance with me...
You know I can't.
Darling.
All right...
No... let's walk through the city.
No, I'm fine.  I'm...  ... wonderful.  Just walking down the street with you again.
Damned if I can keep her out of my equations.
... One day he'll be discovered by some future archeologists and they won't know what to make of him. The thick brow, so lacking in imagination.  The dim little eyes, devoid of curiosity.
Alex, this is your first year as an associate professor.  You might want to play things a little more conservatively.
Emma actually likes chalk dust -- says it smells like me.
Alex, really... good luck tonight. She's a fine girl, and she's done wonderful things for you.
You care for me.  And you're concerned.  And I have to start living my life again.  I hear it from Mrs. Watchit every day.
David... I appreciate your concern, I do.  But I ask you to have faith in me.  Just for a little while longer.  I'm working on something now.  Something... extraordinary.
What is it?
I can't leave when I'm so close.
That's absurd --
And this would be my study.  There was an elm tree outside the window then.
And you saw a shape ahead of you...
Mara...?
Sir, Mr. Philby is here.
Dr. Philby, Dr. Hartdegen.  I received the most extraordinary letter last week.  From a parent. We are always pleased to receive letters from parents.  They are our employers, after all.  This gentleman's son is in your class, Dr. Hartdegen.
I see.
As I recall the syllabus the name of your tutorial is "Applied Mathematics and Engineering", am I correct?
Imagine that.
The advances you speak of were the result of countless years of study and empirical experimentation, a careful evolutionary process, not chalkboard parlor-tricks.
What are your people called?
I'm sorry, I didn't mean to...
What do you mean?!
I found you.  I saved your life. You were bleeding all over the place!
What about Starks?
[Beat] So they say. [Off Becker's steady gaze] What?
I didn't dream it. I may have been asleep but it wasn't a dream. BECKER sits down in a CHAIR, half-shrouded in the light.
I had a patient a few years ago. His name was Ted Casey...
And what's that?
And what does that mean?
No. I'm not his son. I'm him. [Beat] What? You look like you've seen a ghost. You can come here and touch me, old man. I'm the real thing.
I know. [Beat] You killed me, didn't you?
That's right! Goddamn, you're the spitting image. I didn't know he had a son.
That's too bad.
We're late.
I'm sorry I can't tell you more about your father's death, Mr. Starks. Our own medical examiners determined only that he died from a blunt trauma to the head but that was right around the time the Alpine Grove's staff changed and I'm afraid we didn't have the best record system before then.
Well, Dr. Lorenson is still here at the hospital. If she was here at the time your father was, then I'm sure she'd be of more help to you.
[Beat] I know it doesn't make sense. It doesn't even make sense to me.
Jackie, I'm William Starks. I can prove it.
What? Now you're gonna show me some kind of driver's license?
Stop it! Stop it! JACKIE covers her ears and looks at him, pleading with her eyes. STARKS' eyes plead right back.
I gave you my dog tags.
No, you didn't. They found William Starks' body dead in the snow.
Let's see if they have an address for Becker. I also want to figure out more about the kid you helped her with.
What about Captain Medley? He never told them what happened to you over there. His testimony...that coward wanted them to think you were crazy.
I might not be able to.
Me, too.
They're not here.
I don't know. But this isn't a dream. I'm real, and so is where we are.
Because I don't think I'm crazy.
I could try to...make it stop.
At the end, he made me change my mind about a lot of things.
But Dr. Morgan said you were around when my father was...
How do you know about Dr. Becker?
What about the world?
And how do you know that?
How do you know about Eugene?
Some part of you suspects -- even if you don't know for sure -- that what I'm saying is true.
Can I get some paper and something to write with.
I tried to kill my wife.
Geez, how's that for a fucking "thank you"?
In case you hadn't figured, it's Christmas Eve. You're never gonna get a cab here.
I'm not sure.
They told me I joined the army when I was seventeen. That's when my father died and, before that, it was apparently just me and him since I was born 'cause my mom split.
What?!
I'm asking you seriously, Sarah, a stranger?
We spoke with a gentlemen today who says he personally delivered very close to that same amount to a Miss Louise Sawyer.  Do you know her too?
Umm, yes.  She was driving.
He said he took it to a motel in Oklahoma City.  He also says that at that time he met a man.  He identified you through a series of mug shots.  He also told us that you and Mrs. Dickinson seemed "close." Is that true?
Now that you mention it, they might have been a little bit jumpy.
How do you know I took it?  How do you know they didn't just give it to me?
Well, you'd best get something. Even if they didn't do it, it times out that they most likely witnessed it.  I want somebody to at least talk to 'em.  Put out an APB with a description and see what we get back.
I swear to God, she wouldn't tell me one thing!  Christ!  You oughta try to find that kid that was with 'em.
Now, for one thing, you violated your parole two days out.  And you know Judge Hainey.  He hates this sort of thing.  Once he gets wind of this, he's gonna blow sky high.  And then when he finds out that you're a possible accessory to murder and armed robbery, well, I think we can safely place your ass back in the slammer for at least the remaining eight, don't you?
Don't.  I'm married.  I don't feel good.  I've been sick.
That sounds nice.
Oh.  I... where's Louise?
I'm a robber.
Tell me.
Louise, let me call you back after I wire it, so you'll know which office to go to.
No, honey.  I told him I was buyin' a car.  What is it for?
Hello...
Jimmy... it's beautiful!
Damn, Jimmy, did you take a pill that makes you say all the right stuff?
Yes.
And steal Darryl's fishin' stuff.
I don't know how to fish, Louise.
Can't you tell when somebody's hittin' on you?
Exactly.
Thelma, I'm gonna hit the little girls' room, and then we gotta hit the road.
Get the car.
Shouldn't we go to the cops?  I mean, I think we should tell the police.
We have to think this through.  We have to be smart.  Now is not the time to panic.  If we panic now, we're done for.  Nobody saw it. Nobody knows it was us.  We're still okay.  Now all we have to do is just figure out our next move.
If you weren't so concerned with having a good time, we wouldn't be here right now.
Just what is that supposed to mean?
What do you mean?
Why are you actin' like this?
Well, what's the big rush, Thelma? If we just give 'em some time, they'll come to us...!  Oh Christ. I'm just not ready to go to jail yet.  Why don't you go out to the pool or something and I'll figure it out...
I've been tellin' you that for the last ten years.
Well, it looks like we can get on this road 81 that heads down towards Dallas, then cut over to...
How do I look?
Nothing.  Why?  Do I seem different?
Yes, now that you mention it.  You seem crazy.  Like you're on drugs.
I mean I finally understand what all the fuss is about.   This is just a whole 'nother ball game!
Now you get a grip, Louise!  Just drive us to Goddamn Mexico, will ya!
You're disturbed.
I want you to call Darryl.
What?!
Louise... are we still going to Mexico?
And I don't want any more Wild Turkey, either.  It's burning a hole in my stomach.
We should head a little further in. There's not that many roads in this state.  I want to try to hit Mexico somewhere not so close to New Mexico.  They probably wanna kill us in New Mexico.
About two hundred and fifty miles.
Go.
Hi there!  You alright?
Woogie, I caught you red-handed.
I'm asking you to leave.
It must be great with a wife like that.
I told you, her family moved to Miami.
I mean since then.
So that was it? One bump in the road and you gave up?
Maybe you're right. I should look on the bright side. I mean, I've still got my health...  I'm out of here. I've got to get up at six a.m. to move my boss's brother into his apartment.
Mints?
So... I see you made the news.
Bob, do you remember Mary?
Who?
Okay? With this pad, the killer wheels? Looks like you really cleaned up your act.
Take it easy, that's Bill.
The sawbones?
Hey, love will make you do fucked-up things.
Well... it's just a condo really. Right outside Katmandu.
I beg your pardon?
I know he's around here someplace.
That grandmother of yours -- she's really something.
What?
Ted, I'm the kind of guy who shoots from the hip. Now I want you to level with me: Did you knock this skirt up?
It's just that... Mary. I wouldn't have thought...
It's a goddamn bunion. It'll heal.
Mary's a mail-order bride?
You fucked me, man? Why would you do that?
Have you been to  Let's see -- Santiago, Chile?
Absolutely! I was there twice last year. Which building is yours?
You know, I really should take your card.
Whoa, whoa -- I don't know what you're talking about.
That stalker Ted got to you, right? You're working for him, aren't you, you little shit?
Ho-ly shit.
Hm?
The point is, love isn't about money or social standing or age, it's about connecting with someone, having things in common kindred spirits.
Sure.  Uh, Magda, why don't you get some more cheese and crackers...?
Knock it off, Pollyanna, just 'cause you're in love doesn't mean everyone else has to be.
You vicious bitch, how do you sleep at night?
He's a nice guy, isn't he?
I've been looking for a guy -- not one of these South Beach pussies.
Don't get all gooey on me now, you'll give me a big head.  The important thing, Doctor, is you've got to distance yourself as much as possible without pissing this psycho off.
Ted, are you okay?
Really? I never got a message.
So you're a writer?
...and then it was all over.  We haven't spoken since.
Wait, hold on, Mary -- it's not as bad as it sounds. I certainly didn't know --
Well yeah, I didn't know much about him. I just thought --
Please leave.
What what are you doing here?
Really?
It.
One guess.
Would you shhh! Mary's gonna hear us.
Uh-huh.
What are you doing?
Yes.
And it can be relayed beyond Comrade Khruschev's ears to the top circles of my government
Good.
Lying bastard. Lied to my face.
Goddamn Stevenson. Jesus. Peace at any price. You'd think nobody learned anything from World War Two.
He gets it, but he's pissed.
He didn't have to worry about nuclear weapons.
What happened to speak when spoken to?
And Jack wants to trade the missiles in Turkey.
Hey, Mac. You're up bright and early.
John. How much time?
We have high confidence in the expanded air strike option.  The problem, Mr. President, is that it's a short-term solution. Khruschev can send more missiles next month. The Chiefs and I believe we should follow up the air strikes with the full version of OPLAN 316.
I saw you out there. You want him to call you back, need you.
Well. There is a new civil rights initiative he wants to talk about.
Kenny! What happened? They didn't let me up front, said the President was on the phone the whole time.
I was eating that.
You don't show for Chicago, everyone'll know there's something going on.
I don't care. Cancel it.
In the morning I'm taking charge of the blockade from the situation room. McNamara'll set up shop in the flag plot at the Pentagon, keep an eye on things there.
Heroes ain't supposed to shake. I'm shakin', man, look at me.
Anyone stops us going in, we're with the Bowen-Hamilton Textile Company. We have rug samples.
I see.
The main problem is, Ray, these people are extremely distrustful of outsiders, non-Indians. Relations have not been amicable.
Taking ol' Leo somewhere?
-- did you understand me when I said that --
Keeping of the souls. Do they still burn their dead or something?
Jesus, you alright?
Sorry, Cooch. I lost Eagle Bear --
You didn't tell me about Red Deer Table --
-- what the hell is Red Deer Table?
Bullshit.
Is that right? Well, listen to this: drag your ass. This is a restricted area.
You got no know-how. About Indian Way. Or about Jack Shit for that matter.
Maybe you're not aware of this, Crow Horse, but I just flew in from a place called the Twentieth Century where we have such things as electrostatic tracking methods, psycholingusitics, DNA fingerprinting; I don't have to crawl around with the scorpions and talk to the fucking trees to get answers. Leo was killed right here.
Don't tell me: heavy duty.
Ray --
It's not real.
Cuz you're a cop.
You had a vision. You had yourself a vision. A man waits a long time for a vision. Might go his whole lifetime and never get one. And along comes some instant Indian with a Mastercard and brand-new shoes, has himself a vision.
Sorry.
Maybe it was just a dream. Ya know, just one of them, what do ya call 'em, fitful dreams?
I thought it was a rare case of a brother getting a break in the courts. We did an honorin' song for him and everything.
Who did?
I desecrated it?
Wa-shee is like... a dumpling. Like tallow we put in stew. I think he was calling you chubby boy.
X21, give me a 20.
Ray...
You ever try solitary confinement?
I get thrown in solitary until I don't know my own fuckin' name, and then you people tell me I can beat nine years if I help you. I helped you!
What do you know about spirits? You ain't no In'dn.
Well, it is. It is that, too.
Save you from a big mistake with that other guy.
I thought he'd never leave.
He was in a 4G Negative dive and you were on his six?
Apology acknowledged.
Too aggressive?
I thought there was something... That night in the club...
What are you talking about?
What if he's not?
A date... Coffee... A drink...A walk in the park.
That's true. What are you?
You're not, cause you eat frozen meatballs?    Things die. Every time you breathe, you kill millions of tiny organisms. Every time you eat, something had to die.
Are you really that brave?
I'm still second best.
...they say you're alright.
No.
I want it back.
Hardly ever.
You're crazy.  That's a pretty silly game.
You say the truth.  Go ahead. Don't be afraid. You want to win the game, don'tcha?
Hey, I never said I was a fighter pilot...I never claimed to think it was fun to be shot off the end of a ship in a storm. I can find contentment in a good book. I don't have to roar by someone at Mach two with my hair on fire. Sometimes...I just get happy being with the right man.
Well?
I'M UP HERE TOO, MAVERICK.
YOU BETTER NOT BE RAGGING ME... IF YOU'RE FLYING UPSIDE DOWN...
Bring it left. Bring it left, You're high.
Were upside down!
You're crazy. We're level.
What are you doing?
If I could fly like you I'd have everything I want. If I could fly at all. I can't fly. I can't fly like that. Nobody can. Whatever it is, you've got it!
I've got it -- hold on!
5000 feet. Speed two hundred.
What do you want?
Got you here.
Slider -- they let you into Top Gun? If you're among the best in the Navy, I tremble for the security of this country.
So's my Johnson.
I think, yeah, we'll show you a thing or two.
Keller, Black Lion Squadron. I knew him at Pensacola. He's damn good.
Is there anybody in the Navy you don't know?
You ever done this before?
Ahhh...A little high on the left, don't you think?
What?
Come on, come on! It's double or nothing.. We're talking twelve bucks American, here.
1000.
No, we...got our butts kicked.
That's because you don't have any women.
Coogan spent half the night looking for her. He said he was gonna kill the son-of-a-bitch who ruined his sister.
Who is the best.
Need a hint?
The hard deck for this hop was ten thousand feet. Jester, at what point did you call off the fight?
I...FORGOT SOMETHING.
SNAPSHOT..MISSED HIM..
VF 51, the Oriskany. You remind me of him. You're just like he was, only better...and worse.
He was by the book, all the way.
First time on Mars?
What the fuck is going on down there?!
Richter, do you know why I'm such a happy person?
Perfect!...Get out of Sector G.  Now. Don't think.  Do it.
What is it?
What the fuck is going on here?!  You can't install a simple goddamn double implant?!
I'll do what I can.  It's getting messy in there.
I see.  Slipping away for a little hanky-panky.
Your sexual orientation?
You're strapped into an implant chair, and I'm monitoring you at a psycho-probe console.
She's real.  I dreamed about her before I even went to Rekall.
Pull them out.
Shit!
What trip?
You went to Rekall, remember?
Come on, let's go have that drink.
Shit!
Let's do it.
Doug, maybe we should take a trip.
--I got a trip to Mars.
Forget Rekall, will you!  These men were going to kill me...
The job's real. -- But the Agency set it up.
O.K. then.  If I'm not me, then who the hell am I?
You sure you don't wanna...?  For old time's sake.  If you don't trust me, you can tie me up.
Clever girl.
Right.  That's why you tried to kill me.
Come on, don't bullshit me.
What about the guy you lobotomized...Did he get a refund?
You.  You're the same.  No matter where you go, there you are. Always the same old you.  Let me suggest that you take a vacation from yourself.  I know it sounds wild, but it's the latest thing in travel. We call it an "Ego Trip".
Secret agent...How much is that?
I said get out!
All sorts of things.  You might even remember you loved me.
Are you all right?  Are you still you?
Where's this "reactor" come from?
Rhonda.  Rhonda LeBeck.  She's getting some kind of strange readings on her things.
Breaker there, Earl.  What do you want us to do?
That's four.  Let us know if it starts moving, Burt.
How much you think?
You're not getting any penetration, even with the elephant gun.
What's under the ground?  We're not getting up on the roof.  Earth shelter's the best.  Known that since I was a kid.
Let's go you two.  We're headed for the mountains.
Hi, guys.  Burt loaned me his camera.
You're really leaving, huh?
Handymen, Earl.  We're handymen.
Don't matter.  They're all the same: dead weight.  Can't make a decision, can't walk because of their shoes, can't work because of their fingernails.  Make my skin crawl!
So long, cactus!
Car's gone.  We just missed them, that's all.
That <u>is</u> the plan...I mean, goddamn it!  What the hell are those things?  How could they bury an entire Plymouth station wagon?
This is one big mother!
Hey, Rhonda, you ever heard of <u>any</u>thing like this before?
Well...haven't seen a sign for hours.  Maybe it's long gone.
Well...that's it.  We're not getting off this rock...
Light it, man!  LIGHT IT!!
Yeah...but no ties.
Somebody paying you to do this?
You are so full of shit...
We have to go into Bixby in the morning.  The concrete blocks are in.
That's the sky that's going to be over our roof every night, when we're done.
Twenty.
You okay?
Listen, they only respond to vibration, right?  Couldn't we... distract them somehow?
I noticed.
What, "everything"? You shot a corpse. I don't give a shit about that -- !
I don't venerate drug dealers, Roger. To the contrary.
Ten years is a long time.
So an upstanding member of the Aryan Warriors wouldn't paint them on. They take those teardrops seriously -- they're badges of courage, of honor. Only their most vicious killer elite get to wear them...!
I'm not that desperate.
I didn't put him in a wheelchair. Reynard did. He can get around without one -- it's all in my report.
I'm a professional, Eddie. Getting paid is all the thanks I require.
That's right.
Want to tell me what went down here?
Exactly what happened then?
I killed the motherfucker.
I guess he... wanted you to think he was... somebody he wasn't.
No.
-- How could I help you?
When you leave this place you're going out to dinner or a movie or get laid. Where's our bond? I'm going back to my cell and wait to die. So tell me: Where's our bond?
Did the police make any attempt to phone you, to follow up?
Yes, but that's not the issue. What's on your wish list, Ed? Pleading Kim out to first degree man on both homicides, with an agreed sentence of 15 to life running concurrent? Come on... What're you looking for here?
But I'm a quick study. Tell your Deputy D.A. -- Rabin? -- that I'll see him in court.
Didn't this investigation, with its attendant publicity, catapult you into the office you now hold?
Mr. Dowd, I was personally involved with all phases -- and principals -- of the investigation.
I'll take odds on Cecil Number Two.
Then it was your idea to have Chuckie Roeder scare Eddie off the case?
Do the rival gangs compete for control of the prison drug trade?
"Name, rank and serial," Mr. Ortega. Let's not hide behind the Fifth.
A soldado, he runs messages and materiel between the regiments...
Mr. Ortega, what is Shu Kai Kim's rank within La Compania?
Soldado.
Isn't it unusual for an Asian to be accepted into a Cuban prison gang?
I think what Eddie wants to say is --
What color hair will she have?
Blonde.
That's not important. I will tell you what is important. The fan will soon be starting.
I'M NOT KIDDIN'. WHERE WERE YOU? WHO WERE YOU WITH?
Get lost Bobby.
Well, little fella, we don't need any outside help here. I don't like you people sniffin' around my neck of the woods. In fact, when the state boys called me about a "J. Edgar" coming up I think I said, "So what?"
I am not going to Cliff's trailer.
Can I ask you where you were the night Teresa Banks was murdered?
Smell something fishy, huh?
Congratulations. I heard about that.
What?
Stanley, I heard all about it.
No one could've found those splinters without a machine like this and no one has a machine like this.
The later events have never been kept a secret.
He's dead -- good and dead.
Sheriff Cable's already asked me a few questions about Teresa Banks. She worked nights for a month. That's it.
What do you mean?
Code. If you work with Gordon you learn that right away.
Accidental?
I couldn't help but notice that you had a suspicion that Deputy Cliff was the murderer. You did think that, didn't you, Agent Desmond?
You graduating this year will be proof that miracles happen.
Why are you suddenly so interested in who I am going to see at night? Nighttime is my time.
Yes, James is very sweet. Why don't you get out your violin, Donna?
Do you think that if you were falling in space you would slow down after a while or go faster and faster?
Maybe I better start our homework.
Donna, are you my best friend?
No, you should forget about last night.
I already made you two tapes.
What the hell is wrong with you?
That's right. There's no place left to go is there, James?
What is wrong with us?... We have everything.
Shit, maybe he'll kill you.
I had to see Bobby. I know you really don't like Bobby, but there was a problem and I didn't think you would understand.
Ben asked him to stay late to plan for the Norwegians.
Dad.
Who was that?
Yes.
DON'T MAKE ME DO IT.
NO, YOU HAVE TO KILL ME.
They don't call them lovers in high school, Leland.
Someone who knows how to clean knows where the object was before she started cleaning and then that object goes back to its exact same spot. Shelly, I know where everything in this house is. Sometimes on the road I mentally go through this whole house and picture where every item is.
Lay off the bennies, Leo.
Come back as soon as you can.
Mr. Abraham...
She's the only nurse who isn't testifying for the Doctors.
So what I want to do is stop it here. I'm going to make him an offer. I want to do it myself. I want it to come from me.
Well, of course, it's always dangerous...
You thought it was just.
Because it struck me how neatly 'three' went into the amount. Two Hundred Ten Thousand. That would mean I keep seventy.
Nothing that we can do can make that woman well.
No.
That's not my handwriting.
Yes, I, yes, I signed it, yes. But I, I didn't write that figure.
How old are you?
Mr. Concannon...?
Thank you, your Honor. Further: Ms. Costello is a rebuttal witness. As a 'Surprise Witness' she may only serve to rebut direct testimony. As her only evidentiary rebuttal was the admitting form, which has been disallowed I request that her entire testimony be disallowed and the jury advised that they must totally disregard her appearance here.
She'd aspirated vomitus into her mask...
...the Archdiocese called up, they said who was our attorney, 'cause the case is coming to trial...
What is this going to cost?
Dr. Thompson...?
Yes. Yes. I think so. I hope you'll be comfortable. I'm putting you up at my...
I'm afraid that's not true.  Will you want me to stay on till Monday?
Actually, yes. It's by no means bad, I...
...Page 414, 'If a patient has taken nourishment within one hour prior to inducement, general anesthetic should be avoided at all costs because of the grave risk the patient will aspirate food particles into his mask.' Is that what happened to Deborah Ann Kaye? She aspirated into her mask?
Negligent. Yes... it would have been criminal. But that was not the case.
I appreciate -- a man as busy as --
Mrs...
One hour.
Yes.
Why is that?
I'm sure it is, Frank: and let me tell you something. If we find it so complex, how in the hell you think you're going to make a jury understand it?  See my point? Let's talk a minute. Frank: what will you and your client take right now this very minute to walk out of here and let this damn thing drop?
Ready, your Honor.
Sustained. Yes. The witness will confine his testimony to review of the hospital records.
Listen to me, fella...
Laura.
Maybe what?
Is this a bad time.
I've got to work.
If I don't 'grow up...'
Continental Casualty...
We have a renew-your-subscription offer...
I want someone who was in the O.R. We're going to win the case, there's no question of that. It's just a matter of how big...
I've got nothing to say to you.
Nothing happened.
Fuck you. I got a call today from Sally Doneghy...
They killed her. And they're trying to buy it...
...he's a good man...
So what...? The best is yet to come. Check the TV Guide. They got our Dr. Towler on a panel on GBH on Friday: 'The Healing Hand. The Experts Speak.'
I can't talk now.
D'you find the obstetric nurse?
All right. Who wasn't in the O.R.?
...four years ago...
That Frank was working on. Yeah. He thought Franky needed some help, so they bribed a juror. So Franky finds out. He comes to me in tears. He thinks that anybody who knows what a 'spinnaker' is got to be a saint. I told him 'Franky, wake up. These people are sharks. What do you think they got so rich from? Doing good?' He can't be comforted. He tells the boys at Stearns and Harrington they've disappointed him, he's going to the Judge to rat them out.
Madrid has just blacked out!! Nothing more coming through.
I'm sorry.  I don't smoke.
I just told them the local situation. Colonel Heffner's in full charge now.
We'll get safely out of here, don't worry.
It was...  ...one of them!
That's right - came down in kinda spurts, didn't it?  You fellers'll have to figure it out.  You're scientists  All I know - they say it's as big as a house and practically red hot.
So is the town, I notice!
That's their position?  You've certainly got them surrounded.  I suppose they've neutralized all communications here.
I thought you'd killed Freddy off.
He's very excited about it.
What?
Just an earthquake, Dylan.  Every once in a while we get a few.
Maybe.  Or maybe I shouldn't do this interview today.
If these had been a few inches nearer to the wrist... What did you say you cut yourself on?
Doctor...
I want my kid out of here now!
Who?
He's on his way.
Your bed?
Do you have to die to see God?
Must've read about the funeral.  Sick mother.  That's the last thing you need right now, I'm sure.
Wes won't show it until it's finished. That's what he told me, at least.  I asked him at the funeral.
When do you think it'll be done?
I've never mentioned it to him.
John Saxon.  Do you have any idea what time it is?
Dylan's run away from the hospital.  I don't know whether he's wandering around or heading for the house.  But I think Freddy's after him.  I know it sounds crazy!
Is Chase Porter your husband?
I'm sorry, I can't.
Then, in this nightmare in progress, does this thing have any weaknesses?
And how about your co-star in NIGHTMARE I.  Would you trust him alone with your child?
Really!  Listen, Heather, I won't take but a minute of your time.  It's just that we have something to propose to you, and wonder if you'd stop by the offices. Bob'd love to talk to you.
Can I get you something to drink?
So to all you sailors who've fought wind and whale...
We'll bear off to port and run down wind.
Come in.
I thought we'd find a store, get you fixed up and then get you some lunch.  That sound good?
Rick March.  Who the hell are you?
Bregitta.  Do you believe it?
You know?  Then why are you up here looking like you're about to jump overboard?!
Yeah, but how are you supposed to make the first move?
But that's not the point...
No, I didn't.
Goodbye Mom.  I'll be okay.
Jesus.
How ya doing?
You think Skipper and Alice do it?
Jesus, you never told them?
Shouldn't we turn away?
Can't do it.
Chicken is a fool's game captain.
So when the captain gave you an order contrary to your training, you thought he was making a mistake?
Well, what does it have to do with? Us?
They're in a hurry to grow up.  They don't know about consequences or responsibility.  That's being sixteen too.  I promise you one thing...
They think we're carrying Cuban refugees.  Skipper, they mean to board us.
That's enough.
What's your problem?
I couldn't do it.
But, they don't speak English.
Do me a favor and tell Bill once she's dogged down I want everyone to break out their slickers and make sure their gear is stowed or we'll spend the next week sorting underwear.  Lawford, Bill, Mike, John, and Phil will stand the watch.  Everyone else hit the racks.
I can't.
We'd come twelve thousand miles together, through every kind of seas imaginable...
There are allegations questioning your competence with regard to the command of the Albatross.  I have been instructed to convene a formal tribunal to determine whether or not negligence played a part in the sinking.
It wasn't hard.
The families... want your ticket. Turn it in, we forget the whole thing.  Everybody goes home.
And you didn't do anything about it?
Seein's how you're about as thick as a used string of unwaxed dental floss, don't know how you can criticize.
Can't all husbands be perfect, and your Elmo prob'ly wouldn'ta ever got that second one pregnant, you hadn't kicked his ass out.
No, he's out changin' the oil in the car.
This your car?
No.
Wouldn'ta guessed it, that's sure.
When did you talk to Lula?
What's she doin' here?
Nice of you to drop by.
Told ya I would. You still riled?
What'd you say?
That's right... Could have a bad accident, though... before... durin'... or after a hold-up...
What's the name of it?
You hitched yet?
He wants to take Mr. San Pedro Sula and me bass fishing.
What happened on the charges?
This is a snakeskin jacket, and for me it's a symbol of my individuality and my belief in personal freedom.
Teddy Roosevelt, one of the local shrimp boat captains is in jail now. These people are friends of mine, so I must return and find out what happened.
Gotta admit, you guys are -  two in four dozen.
He served his time for what he did. Another thing... If Lula went with him of her own volition - willingly, that is - there ain't much can be done about it.
I'll hire a hit man if you don't want to help me stop this thing. I'll call Marcello Santos.
Really, Marietta, you got more scenarios swimmin' around in your brain than Carter got pills. Try to take it easy. Go over to Myrtle Beach for a few days.
Johnnie, I can't tell you, honey. Is there anyway we can get on the road tonight? We've got to find them kids.
Johnnie... That's the past... We gotta get on to our future, sugar!
Nothin', honey.  Mama's just actin' strange.
You ain't actin', mama.
Case daddy don't like me. What if he don't like that I don't got his color hair.
I guess I started smokin' when I was about six... My mama was already dead from lung cancer...
What brand'd she smoke?
Here she goes again...
At Pee Dee, all you think about is the future, you know? Gettin' out? And what you'll do and what you'll think about when you're on the outside again.
Sound like ol' Dell's more'n just a little confused, peanut... Too bad he couldn't visit that ol' Wizard of Oz and get some good advice.
...That's an awful long way to go, just to get some pussy.
What'd you say to her?
Manslaughterer, honey, not murderer. Don't exaggerate.
Come look at this.
Heard on the radio how doctors is usin' leeches again, just in old times. You know, when even barbers used 'em?
Huh?
My God,  it better be, darlin', cause it'd be the last... What time is it?
No, I like gettin' up around four a.m. and talkin' bout wild animals... Though you woke me up this time in the middle of a dream. I kinda wish I didn't remember it. Up at Pee Dee, I couldn't remember any of my dreams.
Sometimes dreams just don't mean nothin'... Stuff comes into your mind and you don't have no control over, you know? Anyways, dreams ain't no odder than real life. Sometimes not by half.
You think he saw us?
I know, sugar... But while the place was burnin'... Before Santos came out - I pitched some rocks at the second floor windows case anyone was upstairs sleepin'... Afterwards... When I met you, I always liked to think I mighta saved your life.
Lula, you there?
Yeah, I'm here.
Let's get ahold a' her quick.
She died right in front of me. Why'd she have to go and do that, Sailor?
Sailor? You know what?
It's okay by me, peanut.
Really, Sailor, it ain't nothin' against you. I love you.
That was a accident. I bet both our asses Bobby Peru done murdered all kinds of people, and meant it, too.
Damn!
No, baby, don't! Can I send you somethin'? You runnin' low on money? I'll wire you some money if you tell me where you are.
Figure we'll go have supper someplace. Maybe get some barbecue out by Stateline. Sailor always liked that Havana Brown's Pig Pickin'.
What if I told you not to?
I don't understand this... I don't understand this one bit. He was supposed to meet me right her in this lobby. Somethin' bad has happened - I jus know it.
Oh God! What does that mean?
Santos... It isn't.
NO... For God's sakes, Santos!
No.
Santos... No... Please, Santos...
Does that girlfriend of yours know that her mama and Santos killed her daddy?  Does she know her own daddy was one of the biggest drug dealers around - till he started snortin' the shit himself?...  Does she know you was around that night her daddy was set fire to?
Well?...
Fascinating. Listen, why don't you come out with us after the lecture. There's a place on the Hill I always get Trip to take me.
Tripp!
Your wife.
Primarily. Although I gather you two staged a little raid on the Crabtree pharmacopoeia. You missed a few bottles, by the way.
Well, I'm going to read it anyway.
No sexual confusion there, eh, Professor?
He's a boxer. A flyweight.
Vernon, then. Vernon Hardapple. The scar's are from a -- from a horse. He fell during a race and got trampled.
And now he's addicted to painkillers.
What's this guy's problem?
It's a little late to call Admissions.
Jesus. There must be two dozen windows on that thing. How are we supposed to find his?
Find the jacket.
He said a few things that lead me to believe the car's his.
Uh huh. So. We find Vernon, we find the car. We find the car...
...we find the jacket.
Naturally you have copies.
Or Hemingway, when Hadley lost all those stories.
Excuse me?
It's mine.
I've been trying to finish a book...
Vernon.
Who the hell is that?
Let me get this straight. All that paper that went into the river. That was the only copy?
Boy or girl?
Sure.
Where are you, Grady? An elevator?
I'm in Kinship. Listen, Sara, there's some things we need to talk about...
No. Sara, you don't understand...
Relax, James. I'm not her father. I just rent her a room.
Is that really it?
It's feels unreal, like butterfly wings or... something. It must've cost Dr. Gaskell a lot.
I had to. Didn't I?
Yea, James.
Oh. So. Is -- is your friend Crabtree -- is he -- gay?
Good, James. If the Zodiac killer calls, be sure to mention the back door pops open with a couple hard shakes to the right.
But... ?
Nothing, it's just that, well, it's been awhile since Arsonist's Daughter, and some people -- some of the kids in workshop -- thought maybe you were...
Blocked.
How did I get here last night?
There is, but it's not that interesting.
I never heard of it.
James Leer, are you telling me your mother was a stripper?
I'm telling you what I was told by my uncle. And he should know. He ran half a dozen men's clubs in Baltimore before he skipped town on a bad debt.
The one that left you?
You're mad because I shot your girlfriend's dog.
I'm sorry.
No thanks.
I'm not going, with them.
Can I -- I mean -- do you mind -- if I wear this again. Professor Tripp?
I thank you.
That strikes me as odd.
I thought we were going to talk. Last night.
Actually, He's not the Chancellor's -- What?
That good, huh?
Pow.
You got me.
I heard.
Your fingerprints were all over the bedroom.
Oh. Right. Ha. Listen, about last night. There is something I need to tell...
Who's that sitting in your car?
This is not what the university has in mind when it promises a liberal education, Grady.
And what did you say?
I'm through improvising.
Oh, Grady. You're such a putz.
GRADY Tripp. English Department.
I have... eight-fifteen. That's not right, is it?
What exactly are we doing here, Professor Tripp?
Neurologist? Why? What's wrong?
Hardapple?
Huh? Oh, someone pulled a B&E on Dr. Gaskell's closet. And the dog's missing.
I was just thinking of... the noise.
Law says I can't come within one hundred feet of where children congregate. I figure the distance from my window to the school is one hundred and twenty. Make a bet?
I remember when they all referred to me as "the little spic poor Annette married." Except her brother. You treated me with respect.  Look, you paid your dues. Your slate is clean now.
She was going to throw it out, wasn't she? Just toss it like a scrap of wood.
Ah, come on.
Tell Annette I'm busy in July.
A solitary vireo. I like that one.
Their sound is quite musical.
Not at first. You would stare at the tops of the trees so intently. Any second I thought you would take off and fly.
Sure you do. He cuts open the wolf's stomach, and the girl steps out alive.
You don't know?
I have a passionate girlfriend.
I count my blessings.
Are you taking your medication?
What?
The new man. I'd keep away from him, if I were you.
You don't want to know, but he's damaged goods -- real damaged goods, if you know what I mean.
No you're not.
No.
Yes?
My daddy lets me sit on his lap.
What's her name?
I can't.
You said you couldn't make the sound of a solitary vireo. But you did. Beautifully. I heard you.
Walter?
I'm not running for Mr. Popularity.
Walter, I'd like you to try something for me.
Oh. It never crossed my mind.
How's the journal?
I'm still thinking about it.
Honest? No.
Maybe it's the way I look. Or the sound of my name.
How do you feel about that?
Do you think you're crazy?
We have a few more minutes.
I don't know.
Of course it is! That's why I'm telling you!
Please don't do it again.
No. When I say the word "pretty," when I say the word "pleasure," what is the earliest memory you see?
In my bedroom, sleeping.
In my bed, Rosen. Where do you think?
Just lying there.  We're taking a nap.
I'm talking about you.
Here's this nice, hard working guy who suddenly appears out of the blue and rides the bus to and from work. I mean, who rides the bus anymore?
Most women wouldn't choose it.
You're quiet at work.
I'll buy a plant.
You plan to drink both those beers?
What about them?
I didn't say I didn't enjoy it.
Of course. Sorry. I'm such a fucking asshole.
You think I have a problem?
Hey, there.
Why do you want to know?
You don't molest little girls anymore, do you?
You don't really --
I've changed.
Is it their innocence? Their beauty?...
You know, this is crazy.
Are you serious?
Neither am I.
What's this?
Don't do that.
Gimme a three-eighths socket on a long extension.  So there you were--
Okay so far.
I'm taking you back out.
You wimp.  I had a lot riding on this.  They bought you... more like least rented you cheap--
Did you get anything on the cameras.  Video or anything?
His mixture got screwed up.  He panicked and pranged his regulator.
Look.  I'm just trying to hold this situation together.  I can't allow you to cause this kind of hysteria--
No.
You see where it's coming in?
NO!!  Now be logical, Bud, you're--
Oh God, Lins... I--
We'll take reading as we go.  If the reactor's breached or the warheads have released radioactive debris, we'll back away.  Simple.
I can't afford slack, Brigman.
Hey, you come on my rig, you don't talk to me, you start ordering my guys around.  It won't work.  You gotta know how to handle these people... we have a certain way of doing things here.
We'll go in through that large breach.
God, I hate that bitch.
Is that it?  Is this right?
Hafta... go on to... the moonpool.  Only way.
Lady, we better fish or cut bait.
Schoenick... your Lieutenant is about to make a real bad career move...
How deep?
Stand by on the ROV.
High-Pressure Nervous Syndrome.  Muscle tremors, usually in the hands first.  Nausea, increased excitability, disorientation.
You'll get over it soon. It's the usual anxiety.
But why rattle your brains by arguing and talking... Believe me, Anna, words never help at all. They only serve to confuse. I love you, Anna. Isn't I that enough?
I mean, to stay away longer -- two months... a year... three years... Yes, I know, it sounds absurd. And I feel awful. The very idea of losing you makes me want to die... And yet... I... I just don't have the same feeling for you any more.
And have you any other truths to tell me?
It couldn't have come from anywhere else. At least, somewhere from that vicinity... But I really can't understand it. Contraband cigarettes on that island! It's the first time that ever happened.
Look... I'd like to get back to Lisca Bianca.
Well?
Have you decided?
There's no comparison.
How should I be ... arrogant?
As far as I'm concerned, I think she's alive... Why, even this morning... that business about the shark... it wasn't at all true.
And why do you tell us this only now?
Sandro, I don't want you to come with me, I don't want to see you... How can I make it clear to you?...Why did you come?
Let's get out of here, fast... This is not a town, it's a cemetery.
What do I say? What can I say? No. At least, not yet. I don't know... I can't even think of it... at a time like this... Oh, but why did you have to ask me?
Why?
One would have to be in love with somebody to know that.
Have you ever been in love?
And tell Corrado, too, that I'm here... if he wants me. You can also tell him that my tiny little heart is beating like mad, and that at this moment, it's the only thing that interests me. Is that clear?
I'm going ashore to take a look around the island. There are some ruins up there...
It's strange how anxious women are to display themselves. It's almost a natural inclination.
Very well. First of all, I'll have them search the waters around the island. I brought two frogmen with me... Meanwhile, we'll take a look up around here.
Look, Marshal, with those deep crevasses, you'll need some rope and ladders...
Don't worry, we've got everything.
Another thing; there's an old man who lives here on the island...
Are you the owner of this place?
Listen, Patrizia... The Marshal says there's a current that passes by here and ends up at another island... I don't know which... He wants to send one of his men over to have a look... One never knows... Do you mind if I ask Raimondo to go with him?
You should have told Ettore. He always manages to get what he wants.
Ettore must be fed up with me by now.
Your mother?
You know, I don't love anybody.
You've made some mistake there with the bushes... that's why you can't finish it.
I read one of your articles regarding the disappearance of a girl. I'm that girl's fianc.
Yes, but why do you think our readers would be interested in such news now? Even if I sent it, the editors wouldn't print it.
Yes.
Why does it matter whether you're fat or not...
Nonsense, I'm your mother now and I want you to eat.
Sister Marguerite says you have been sleeping on a bare mattress Sister. Is that true?
Right now?
And you like that?
No. I was sick.
Down... there.
And then what?
From their heads...
Don't you know?
Then let's talk about something else...
No... no, I'm tired of talking, I've been talking for weeks, nobody believes me when I tell them anything... nobody listens to me.
Just that... you ask and I'll answer.
Martha Louise Livingston.
Not at the moment, no.
Where do you think babies come from?
You liked Sister Paul?
Numbers... you can spend your whole life counting and never reach the end.
Yes.
Because I don't want one.
What the child?
That's because you keep reminding me. If you go away then I'll forget.
Everyone's unhappy, you're unhappy aren't you?
Answer me!  You never answer me.
You can tell me.
Her headaches.
Are you pretty?
Yes.
Yes.
Good. Would you like to tell me why you're here?
Yes.
Because I wasn't worthy.
I ate.
Fish...  ... brussel sprouts.
And then what happened?
Is someone in the room with you?
Yes.
She said Michael.
The statue. She had shown it to me the day before.
Where?
Agnes who did you see?
I hate him...
Martha, it's you.
???
Why?  You've done nothing to show any progress.
You have proof?
Marie brings me icecream too you know. Chocolate... my favourite.
Not any more... now I like chocolate.
I remember when you was a little girl Marie. You come back from the movies and you'd say - Mama that ending was so sad... and I'd tell you they had all the happy endings locked away in a vault in Hollywood.  And you believed me.
... Thank you.
I can beat that.
Didn't she have any physical examinations in this time?
Who was the father?
Yes, but I...
What's his name?
Exactly. I want you do deal with Agnes as speedily and as easily as possible. She won't hold up under any sort of cross examination.
So, someone else could have done it.
Who?
This convent is locked solid. The only one that has a key is Sister Marguerite and she wouldn't let Christ in after dark.
And you weren't shocked?
She is not a child.
When would Agnes have conceived the child?
Yes.
The twenty third of January. On that night one of our elder nuns passed away.
I never saw Agnes until she set foot in this convent. My sister ran away from home. We lost touch with her. And when my husband died and I came here, she wrote to me and asked me if I would take care of Agnes in case anything happened.
I don't think I care to know.
She molested her!
Why didn't you?  You knew she was keeping her home from school. You knew she was an alcoholic.
We'll see about that.
An unhappy woman...
Bullshit yourself!
And what has that to do with it?
Undoubtedly. Not the ascetics of course but, well Saint Thomas More...
Yes I do.
Where is she?
Why do you insist upon pressing...
The scandal...
She can't remember.
Lay them down.
We'd be thrown out.
Well, there you are and watch it with that hoop.
Sure.
Have I said something amiss?
But your Grandfather lives in your house. I've seen him.
Now what's that supposed to mean?
Well ... come on.
That must have cost you a fortune in stamps, Ringo.
Are you supposed to be here?
You're from Liverpool, aren't you?
Gear?
Is it really fab or are you just saying that to convince yourself?
Ah.
Oh ... I dunno.
What's he on about?
That'll keep you busy.
Gie's a kiss!
Behave...
Please, can I have one to surge with?
Oh do I? You're the first one who ever said that.
My eyes are lighter.
I knew I could rely on you.
Don't worry about him. He can look after himself.
But...
Do I have to raise me voice?
Oh, down the ... er ...?
Eh. I thought you were looking after the old man.
I'm an electrician, not a wet nurse, y'know.
Yeah, but he insisted on us bringing him to the station.
Engines off.
Do you remember the pyramid?
Where's Irth?
Any rotation?
Gravity?
Approaching point of origin.  Closing at 20 kilometers, 15 and slowing. Ten.  Five.  Gentlemen, we are directly above the source of the transmission.
Appears to be a door hanging open, the entrance is clogged with debris.
Are you okay in there?
Don't you remember?
I have interrupted the course of the voyage.
Yes!
But we can't kill it.  If we kill it, it will spill all its body acids right through our hull and out into space.
Dead.
Don't know -- Broussard got hurt somehow.
Well, uh... good luck.  I hope you won't need me, but if you do, I'm here.
Martin, this is Jay.  The intakes are clogged with dust.  We overheated and burned out a whole cell.
It looks completely different from the first one -- it's more like a worm with legs... and tentacles.
It makes me sick to see him like that.
We can't go into hypersleep with that thing running around loose.
It's over, Hunter.
Well, what the hell good can we do in here?  We can't grab it -- it might jump on us --
We can't pump poison gas down into the cooling unit!  It'll flood the whole ship!
The ship's gravitational attraction must have drawn him back.
I've completely lost their signal.
But they don't know about the translation!  They could be in danger right now.
How many?
This is horrible.
You mean his body was still kicking when it ran off with him?
This should do it.
Just keep your finger off the button till she's way away from the ship, that's all.
Just settle down.  Sandy, you get any response yet?
If we don't hear from him soon, I think we better go in after him.
Okay.
This is Chaz speaking.  Sorry, but we are not home.  Our present location seems to be only halfway to Irth. Remain at your posts and stand by. That is all.
What the hell happened?
I agree.  This is the single most important discovery in history.
Well... it's obviously intentional... some kind of attempt at communication... maybe it's a symbol that means something to them...
I'm sorry to say it looks like you were right in the first place, Martin.  We never should have landed here.
Engaged.
Food-storage room!
Now what?
I saw it.  Faust got himself jammed in the air lock door.  His body held it open.
Let's hear it.
But the lifeboat can't accelerate to light speed.
You know, it's funny -- this stuff we went to so much trouble to dig up -- this treasure, the paydirt -- it'll make it back to Irth just fine -- even if we're not with it.
No good... it's eaten too much of me...
Headache?  Dehydration?
Better?
Drains right into the Central Reservoir.
Fucking great.  I invested some money in them.
Oh, man...
About thirty minutes.  Those are slimmed-down tanks, so no stopping to admire the scenery.
Forget it, man.
Careful of that edging there...
How?
Is it still moving?
Miss Noguchi!  You're wanted in admin.
Okay.
Is this the suit?
Yeah, I stripped down a motion tracker and hardwired it through to the helmet pick-ups, too.  That's also on the display.
There's still time to back-out.
Okay, I'm out of here!
See that sheathing on the suspension? Eaten away.  Same thing with the pumps on the base air purifiers.  The algae out here just isn't good on these new plastics.
Not too much of the socializing type, then?
Any luck raising Ackland's party?
'We'?  You wanna fly out there with me?
Don't worry about it.  If the Network goes by the book, like everyone figures they will, a Marine gunboat from Powell'll drop-by for a look- see in four-or-five days.  They can go poke around out there and find whatever it was hit us.  All we've gotta do is sit tight.
Yeah.  Somebody won.
When we get the link back, and I send this in, I.C.C.'ll throw a fit.
I call myself Phoebe.
That's right.
Nothing of the kind. Karen and I had a nice talk.
Just like that, eh?
Aren't you?
I don't know what I take you for anything...
Then say so.
Because I don't want to.
This must be, at long last, our formal introduction. Until now we have met only in passing...
Like I just swam the English Channel. Now what?
She was magnificent.
Margo.
I distinctly remember striking your name from the guest list. What are you doing here?
Miss Caswell, at the moment, is where I can lend no support - moral or otherwise.
Naturally enough, your understudy.
Just slipped your mind.
Bill...
Where?
Macbeth.
Real diamonds in a wig. The world we live in...
Take care of yourself out there...
That I am...
I get a party, don't I?
What's all over?
Who?
The kid. Junior.
Don't mix your metaphors.
Well, I am.
To Margo. To my bride-to-be.
There goes Eve. Eve evil, Little Miss Evil. But the evil that men do - how does it go, groom? Something about the good they leave behind - I played it once in rep in Wilkes Barre...
I just wondered.
But Hollywood. You mustn't stay there.
So few come back...
Thanks for your help... good luck.
What did you expect - live sables?
Well?
Oh-oh.
Birdie-
She's loyal and efficient-
There's some loose characters dressed like maids and butlers. Who'd you call - the William Morris Agency?
To speak to just a playwright's wife? I'm the lowest form of celebrity...
If I only knew how...
I'll be at the old stand, tomorrow matinee-
Mrs. Richards.
... you want to be Margo's new understudy.
But there must be some reason, something I've done without knowing...
You know, I've always considered myself a very clever girl. Smart. Good head on my shoulders, that sort of thing, never the wrong word at the wrong time... but then, I'd never met Addison deWitt.  I remember once I had a tooth pulled. They gave me some anaesthetic - I don't remember the name - and it affected me in a strange way. I heard myself saying things I wasn't even thinking... as if my mind were someplace outside of my body, and couldn't control what I did or said-
In a way. You find yourself trying to say what you mean, but somehow the words change - and they become his words - and suddenly you're not saying what you mean, but what he means-
Do you expect me to believe that you didn't say any of those things - that they were all Addison?
It's been a real pleasure, Eve.
I mean the performance. Except for you, you'd think he'd never even directed it - it's disgraceful the way they change everything around...
Very becoming. It looks better on you than it did on me.
There's the script to go back to the Guild-
Miss Channing, I can't tell you how glad I am that you arrived so late.
Well, if you'd been here to begin with, I wouldn't have dared to read at all...
Three or four miles...
He always looks so pathetic whenever he does anything physical-
I just never think of Lloyd as anywhere but indoors and anything but sitting down.
Do you want it on?
It doesn't matter.
Come to think of it, I haven't been very pleasant for weeks. For that, I'm truly sorry. More than any two people I know, I don't want you and Lloyd to be angry with me...
What about Bill?
Margo. Bill is all of eight years younger than you.
About what?
With tears.
Lloyd, be careful...
But it can't be! We can't be out of gas! I filled it myself yesterday!  Wasn't it full when you drove to Brewster this morning?
Eve would ask Abbott to give her Costello.
Now just a minute!
After all, maybe she just wants to apologize...
The general atmosphere is very Macbethish. What has or is about to happen?
I'm sure.
That's beside the point.
I never said it was!
I shall never understand the weird process by which a body with a voice suddenly fancies itself a mind! Just when exactly does an actress decide they're her words she's saying and her thoughts she's expressing?
That's right, but I don't understand-
No. You're just crazy about "Liebestraum."
Well, if she can act, she might not be bad. She looks like she might burn down a plantation...
Would you?
--it was bullshit the way it was--
--I'm smart enough to know my story was solid--
--no way--
Forget it, the main thing--  --did you call me a failure?
Hmm.
What's that?
--see?--
Who's first?
Republican?
Goddamnit--
So maybe Watergate wasn't really about Watergate--maybe that was just a piece--
Segretti criss-crossed the country over ten times in six months--and never stayed anyplace over a night or two.  Switch to another station, huh? You're driving me crazy with that.
It's nothing personal, though. 
Woodward?
--almost a year before he left the Justice Department--
Night.
I'm so glad.
--so?
There's always a later plane.
--you don't really think you're being followed?
You don't believe me? Well, I was working the weekend of the break-in and my God, all the executives were running around like crazy--you had to practically wait in line to use the shredding machine--and when the FBI came to investigate, they never even asked me about it.
We don't tell anyone that. Which is why you can talk to us. And if we can't verify what you say someplace else, we don't print it. That's another reason you can relax.
--then again, maybe things are even worse than we've written--
Because people at the Committee were told to lie to the prosecutors?
I really can't talk now--
--that leaves Haldeman, period.
Then it's our asses, isn't it?
--I don't know, I don't know, it feels thin--
I was told by this guy at the White House that Hunt was investigating Teddy Kennedy.
I got Clawsen on hold--
Did you know to come because one of the other men involved in the break- in called you?
A Miami social occasion?  Mr. Rafferty told me the Cubans were from Miami.
Sorry, Ken; listen, one last thing: where did your talk with Berger happen?
If you don't like them, why won't you be more concrete with me?
Go on.
--melodramatic?  Things are past that--remember, these are men with switchblade mentalities who run the world as if it were Dodge City.
What's the whole thing about--do you know?
What I know, you'll have to find out on your own.
Yes, the little ratfuckers are now running our government.
Haldeman too?
There were more then.
I was just kind of wondering why your name and phone number were in the address books of two of the men arrested at Watergate?
You know, the paper was my father's and my husband's when they were alive and I was thinking back a year or two ago when Ben called me and said he wanted to publish the Pentagon Papers the next day. The Times had already been stopped from publishing anymore of them and all my legal counsel said "don't, don't" and I was frightened but I knew if I said no, I'd lose the whole fifth floor. So we published, and that night, after I'd told Ben to go ahead, I woke up in the darkness and I thought, "Oh my Lord, what am I doing to this newspaper?"  I woke up again last night with that same question.  Are we right on this story?
But it's possible.
--this White House guy, a good one, a pro, came up and asked what is this Watergate compulsion with you guys and I said, well, we think it's important and he said, if it's so goddamn important, who the hell are Woodward and Bernstein?
...go on, go on...
Woodward's onto a new wrinkle with the break-in thing--absolute page one stuff--
--in other words, you got nothing, you're thumbsucking.
More denunciations?
--look, when the Watergate grand jury questioned you, did you name names?
What did you just say?
I believe the kegs are upstairs.
Single malt?
Of course, Finch.  What?
Hey, what're you doing here?
Forget it.
Alright, cool.  I gotta hit the showers, but...I think this'll be really good.
I saw you making fun of me with your lacrosse buddies.
Yeah, well my parents wanted me to go to Northwestern.  I didn't want to write all those extra essays they make you do -- I mean, how am I supposed to know what my "most emotionally significant moment" was?  So when my U of M acceptance came in December, I said the hell with it.
Onions?
Well, State's got a good business school.  And I can probably walk onto the lacrosse team.  Green peppers?
I can't think of anything to say that's not cheesy.
What?
I'll give you a hint.  "Ohhh, yeah, yeah!"  Comprende?
You mean...and orgasm?
Well of course I'd want to give her that.  I mean, what do you think, I don't care about her?
I don't want to dupe her, Jessica.  If I say it, I have to be sure I mean it.
No comment.
Separately, we are flawed and vulnerable.  But together, we are the masters of our sexual destiny!
Yeah, it's like tradition or something.
Did I miss anything?!
Yeeeeeeeaaaawwwwww!
Sure you know, son, but I think you've been having a little problem with it. It's okay, though.  What you're doing is perfectly normal.  It's like practice.  Like when you play tennis against a wall.  Some day, there'll be a partner returning the ball.  You do want a partner, don't you son?
Shortstop.  'Course, you don't make it to third, and you're out.
Yes.  No.  Yes.
James!  You have come in here on purpose?!
No, no, you must put your whole body into it.
I am sorry, Jim.  I suppose we will not be doing any studying now.
Oh no, Stifler, what did you do?
It's a big, thick envelope, Vicky. You got in.
Oh, Kev.
Vicky -- do you think, maybe...it's time for us to take the next step in our relationship?
Vicky, wait.
That's my trick!
Kevin?  Do you not love me?
I want to hear you say it.
Yeah, the time went by so fast.
Vicky...last night...I wasn't lying.
What?
Uh -- forget that.  Look, is that all you're interested in?  Ways to get your girlfriend into bed?
How the hell do you know all these random songs?
Feeling better, Oz?
...Guess what?
She works part-time at my dad's store.
You know.  If we hook up, tomorrow I'll just be some girl you go telling all your friends about.
Actually, I'm waiting for someone.
A-duh... You're a werewolf. And we, as your victims, have to walk the earth until your curse is lifted.
Hey, you can't kick me! You're an apparition!
You were. I have work to do. The publisher wants the transcripts by Monday. Go. Make yourself at home.
Professor Claude Rousel. The one your uncle was working with. He teaches cultural history.
Thank God! What a relief! I thought... After you disappeared... I couldn't find you... I thought all sorts of horrible things...
Come on Serafine. Let's go out. Show me the real Paris, the part that isn't overpriced and overrun with German tourists.
That's what counts. If you're not passionate about it, don't waste your time. That's why I quit college... Plus I'm a lazy bastard.  Wait, I know this... A votre sante.
Fixing your makeup with a phone, huh? Who the fuck are you calling?
Professor Roussel. There's something wrong with you. I know it.
I know. He told me.
You two faced bastard. I knew you were full of shit.
We can't stop him. Not now. Handcuffed, with no kind of weapons. Please Andy...
Didn't even have to ask.
Shhh! Be quiet, man! We're not alone -
He's on a new drug called ZBH, or "Daydream". It allows the user to be fully alert and mobile while he's dreaming. He is literally conscious and unconscious at the same time.
It's chemistry, Andy. Nothing more. Mutated antigens concentrated in the heart of the infector unlock a vaccine- like chain reaction in the infectee. There were not many bio-chemists working in the twelfth century, but with today's technology it's possible to synthesize any chemical imaginable. When I discovered this ancient cure I knew who to go to.
How well did, er, do you know him?
Yeah. I guess so.  Did he say anything? Before the coma?
I don't know. There were others much closer. He was religious?
Fuck you! If I'm gonna kill myself I'll do it when I'm good and ready! You can go to hell!
Shit. I feel sick.
Don't worry. In a few seconds you won't feel a thing.
You fucking liar!
Something about a monster, underground, in the catacombs under Place Denfert.
Okay. So maybe you were right.
Saint Severin...
How to read.
Who's Sophie?
Oh, Meetoo! You look miserable! Oh, Vlad - look at him!
Yes, your highness.
Ouch!  That really hurt!
People say Anastasia was the only member of the Royal Family to escape alive.  That makes her an orphan too 
I have my reasons.
Come on up!
It's the best fork of all
It's so beautiful ... and sad.
I'm sorry.
Tell me it isn't true?! Tell me you didn't do this for the money!
Anastasia! It was just a bat! It's gone, dear...
No, it wasn't a bat! I saw this horrible man - I remember him, I think...
You'll have to become used to it, child, if you accept the crown...
What do we do now?
What do you want?!
You're insane! You didn't kill the Romonovs - it was the...
I'm not Ulo and I won't slow down. But you will listen to me!
Empress, no! I will not take the money! I just came to tell you I was sorry...
Hey, you on television?
You wouldn't know it. It doesn't matter. What's the difference?
You were on... uh, the... uh, the Johnny Carson, right?
You don't want my autograph.
Well, you take a meeting with him, I'll take a meeting with you if you'll take a meeting with Freddy.
You're a thinking person. How can you choose this lifestyle?
Oh, comedian. Yes. Oh, uh... you're on next.
What do you mean, next?
Lyndon Johnson?
I-I-I-I would leave out the men's- room attendant.
You're using this conspiracy theory as an excuse to avoid sex with me.
In the middle?  We'll only miss the titles. They're in Swedish.
Alright. All right, all right, so whatta you wanna do?
M'm, I don't know, sometimes I ask myself how I'd stand up under torture.
That movie makes me feel guilty.
If they're only babies, then you pick 'em up.
Look! Look, one crawled behind the refrigerator. It'll turn up in our bed at night.  Will you get outta here with that thing? Jesus!
Yeah, I-I think you're pretty lucky I came along.
Oh, that's right. That you really like those New York girls.
You-you play... very well.
No, um... I was gonna take a cab.
Right!  Where?
Don't be funny.
Who? Grammy? Grammy Hall?
Well... thank you again.
Oh, you see an analyst?
Yeah, uh, I'm gonna give him one more year and then I'm goin' to Lourdes.
Sylvia Plath.
M'hm...
Neat?
Well, I don't know. I mean, I guess- I guess you must be sorta late, huh?
Me? Oh, uh.  No.
No, so help me.
Yeah.
M'hm.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Oh, yeah.
You are extremely sexy.
Do I love you?
You don't want me to live with you?
Me, no. You... I-I-you know, if I have grass or alcohol or anything I get unbearably wonderful. I get too, too wonderful for words. You know, I don't-I don't know why you have to, uh, get high every time we make love.
I don't know. You- It's like you're- you're removed.
You're so sure about it.
"Existential Motifs in Russian Literature"! You're really close.
And then I remembered when I was a kid how I accidentally saw my parents making love.
That's amazing. I-I-I... I've been goin' for fifteen years, I-you know, I don't got... nothing like that in-
Yeah, yeah, yeah, you. Because in the dream... I break Sinatra's glasses.
David! David! I can't believe this!
It was just great!
I got the good chocolate, Alvy.
Very big spider.
Whatta-whatta yuh joining a minstrel show? Geez.  Don't worry!  I did it! I killed them both. What- what's the matter? Whatta you-  whatta you sad about? You- What'd you want me to do? Capture 'em and rehabilitate 'em?
W-w-whatta you mean?
Alvy, let's never break up again. I don't wanna be apart.
You know I think that if you let me, maybe I could help you have more fun, you know? I mean, I know it's hard and... Yeah.
I don't know.
yes, we had, uh...
What's... you... well, what's the matter, You w-wanna go to that party?
The incredible thing about it is, I'm paying for her analysis and she's making progress and I'm getting screwed.
God.
Right. Geez, I feel like there's a great weight off my back. M'mmm.
What?
We can always come back together again. Because there's no-there's no problem. 'Cause... Right.
You know, I-I-I don't think many couples could handle this. You know, they could just break up and remain friends.
The what?
Oh!
Why, I was just expressing a healthy sexual curiosity.
My head is throbbing.
Yeah.
I think-I think there's too much burden placed on the orgasm, you know, to make up for empty areas in life.
I never read that. That was-that was Henry James, right? Novel, uh, the sequel to Turn of the Screw? My Sexual...
I mean, d- He can give you- Do you hafta give it so loud? I mean, aren't you ashamed to pontificate like that? And- and the funny part of it is, M- Marshall McLuhan, you don't know anything about Marshall McLuhan's... work!
Stop calling me Max.
Right, right, so g-get back to what we were discussing, the failure of the country to get behind New York City is-is anti-Semitism.
Yeah, watch the road!
Yes, I remember.  He was all schoolyard. They threw him a football once, he tried to dribble it.
What kind of good memories, Max? Your mother and father fighting all the time.
There's no economic crime, you know, but there's-there's ritual, religious- cult murders, you know, there's wheat- germ killers out here.
Great, but nobody laughs at it 'cause your jokes aren't funny.
Well, sit down.
You wanna lie down?
How about a ginger ale?
Whee, you shoulda told me it was Tony Lacey's party.
Yeah, she's a ten, Max, and that's great for you because you're-you're used to twos, aren't you?
And... uh-
Let 'im drop dead! Who needs his business?!
She was going through my pocketbook!
Oh, God, you should've seen what I looked like then.
Oh, I can imagine. P-p-probably the wife of an astronaut.
If only I had the nerve to break up, but it would really hurt him.
We went over to the swap meet. Annie, Gram and I. Got some nice picture frames.
Oh, that Randolph Hunt. You remember Randy Hunt, Annie. He was in the choir with you.
We just need about six weeks, in about six weeks we could cut a whole album.
Oh, and there's another thing about New York. See... you-you wanna see a movie, you have to stand in a long line.
Uh, how did this personality come about?
There were many men interested in you?
So you were here when they were doing the work on the boundary fence?
So who won?
Oh I think he's cute.  How's the marriage part working out?
She's got great tits.
And you've only just met.
No, what?
I don't know what's going on.  I don't care to guess.  Mac's really unhappy. She isn't there, that's all.  She's no idea what she's playing, not a clue.
Hey, listen, I love her.  She's Sophia's best friend.  I never said any of this, alright.  I'll deny it on the stand...  You guys are gonna have kids.  That is so great.  Maybe that's what this is all about.  Maybe she doesn't want to do this anymore.  You know adults don't do this for a living.  You guys are gonna have your kids, you'll be directing -- one asshole in the family is enough.  Sophia knew that intuitively.  Look at Clair. Clair's a mess.  Make sure she gets the epidural.  Forget that natural childbirth shit. Everything's going to be what it's supposed to be.  "Life is but a walking shadow.  A poor player who struts and frets his hour upon the stage and then is heard no more..." And speaking of me, the role of Leo in your film?
You've got a lot of fucking gall.  Thirty nine.
You're coming swimming in the pool, and in a few minutes you won't even remember what it's about.  You won't care who's in your damn movie.
Oh.
Didn't I say?
Whatever you like.  I'm afraid it'll all be too big for you.  Are you alright, Clair?
You want a Tylenol, or something?
You know Sophia.  She's so damned judgemental.  And she's so damned... perfect.  And so fucking... serene.  Just fucking don't tell her.  Because you know Mac thinks she's God.  And I can feel him comparing.
You need to knock off the pills, Clair.
You should have brought him.
Pictures.  They're always in my tote.  I left my tote in the damn trailer.  But! He's Mac all over again.  Imagine Mac shrunk to two-and-a-half feet.  The fact is they probably didn't even need me for this birth.
Is he not going?  I booked a flight.
Anymore.
What a nose.  You missed your calling.
Can I open it?
In Cheyene Walk?  Lucy's going to have a meltdown.  Oh, I'm so sorry.
Lucy overdosed.
She left a note.
Time.  Hey!  Time.  Judy!  Time you guys. Hey!!
Oh yeah...
Probably not.
I suppose.  Sally, that's quite a gift. I'm not sure it's in your best interest.
The realtor'll be here tomorrow in the morning.  The house had to go on the market to insure the loan on the London flat.
That was the plan.  And you're thrilled to have them.
Take your time, Jer.
Happy anniversary, baby.
What?
Okay.  I'm sorry, look, I meant to tell you.  It was the only chance I had to meet her.
You invited her to our anniversary party? I didn't even invite my mother.
No, no of course not.  It's Skye fucking Davidson, for fuck's sake.
You want me to uninvite her?
Okay, knock it off.
Truce?
Not properly watered.
He'll find his way back.
DO I want anyone else?  No.  Do I want to be with you for the rest of my natural life?  I'm trying.
That is not true.
Well there you go.  I let you off the hook.  You're one goddamn lucky actress.
Okay.  If we could've, by some miracle, stripped ten years off your face, still couldn't have got the thing made. Because I don't mean anything as a director, and your name doesn't mean fuck all anymore.  And the people that can hire you are afraid to, because they think you're phoning it in.  That you don't have... Oh Christ, Sally.
Who?  Who?  Who thinks that?
I'm a monster.  Exactly.
Oh.  Well.  Good.
Yes, she is.
I'm not much of a reader, but I do love autobiographies, even biographies sometimes.  Mostly non-fiction.  Did you read the new Styron?
It's very good.  I understand you won the Booker Prize.
Yes I know.  I started to say... I started to say Joe that --
Do I put you off?
Not particularly.  Weird, isn't it?  God I'm rally up.  Do you feel anything yet, Mac?
No.  No.  Let me tell you something.  Directing's the best preparation possible for fatherhood.  The sleep depravation alone.
What?
Oh shit.  I'm sorry.
Are you okay?
Lemon.
How long have you been married?
How do you do, Skye?
I was faking it.  I've been feeling caged for sometime.  Funny, huh?
I think you should then.  You should look in on Sheila.
Why?
Yes.
Do you need anything else?
I was impressed.
Oh?
Are you asking me to marry you?
She's even better looking in the flesh.
She's all over him, are you blind?
I didn't hear me say tonight.
I'd cut off her red wine if I were you.
No.  Really.  For real.  Really.
I don't want to talk about it.
Hmm.  Where are my kids?
Hm.
But she really gets to the heart of Joe, doesn't she?  She's a genius.
Well, I don't trust her.  I never have.
And the food sucks, I know.
Let's go in the kitchen and spy on everyone.
Well, are you sure about this baby thing? It's not the ticking clock shit, is it?
Ha!  Not half so not kind as your husband was in his portrayal of you in his novel.
Hey, slow it down, big boy.  You're making the rest of us look bad...How come I haven't seen you around here before?
What a bunch of losers.  Mindless zombies capitulating to an oppressive system --
You're the hero of the recent termite campaign, aren't you?
He was a worker.  I danced with him at a <u>worker's bar</u> just the other day. I'm not shocking you, am I?
Gee, uh, could you say it a little louder, I think there are some ants in the next colony who didn't hear you.
Why do they have you tied up here?
I'm the Princess, aren't I?
Bala!
Well, what exactly does our platoon do?  Serve beverages?  Process paperwork?
So we're going back for more armor, right?  I mean, these guys are from outer space, how are we supposed to beat them?!
Be honest, kid -- am I hurt bad?
So this Z...he fancies himself an individual?
Wow, what a spread -- you know, there's a food shortage in the rest of the colony.
No snacking between meals!  Off you go!  Now -- what were we saying?
I do not recollect, your majesty. Will that be all?
All these parties are so marvellously <u>alike</u>.
I can't help it.  I have a thing about drinking from the anus of another creature.  Call me crazy.
Yeah, but I hate drowning more!  Now <u>dig</u>!
Oh -- Miss Kubelik.  I've been waiting for you. FRAN You have?
Just tell 'em -- now and then.
Sounds good.  How do you know where I live?
Thank you.  I thought you were avoiding me.
I shouldn't drink when I'm driving.
You all right? What's the matter?
Guess I made a boo-boo, huh?
Here.
Oh.  Yes?  Just a minute.  If you don't mind -- this is sort of personal
I don't understand --
Two o'clock.
I just want to go brush my teeth --
Someone from the office.
Oh, you're wrong. He told me --
Yes, I've got it.  Don't you think we'd better destroy it? So it won't fall into the wrong hands -- ?
I think I'm going to give it all up.
Well, for one thing, you can't spell. And secondly -- if you did something like that -- you'd hate yourself.
Sure.
Please, Miss Kubelik, you got to promise me you won't do anything foolish.
Who'd care?
For me?
Are you all right?
Gas.  Didn't you turn it on?
You turned it on -- but you didn't light it.
Are you supposed to?
Well, maybe not exactly -- I tried to do it with a gun.
Worse than that -- she was the wife of my best friend -- and I was mad for her. But I knew it was hopeless -- so I decided to end it all. I went to a pawnshop and bought a forty-five automatic and drove up to Eden Park -- do you know Cincinnati?
You don't have to if you don't want to --
We're going to finish that gin game.
Oh.
Don't worry about Dr. Dreyfuss -- I happen to know he was out on a case.
Oh, Mr. Baxter -- I'm glad you're here -- I was just going to get the passkey.
There's a certain key floating around the office -- from Kirkeby to Vanderhof to Eichelberger to Dobisch -- it's the key to a certain apartment -- and you know who that apartment belongs to?
Who?
Loyal, cooperative, resourceful C. C. Baxter.
Where are you going, Baxter?
Baxter, you're not reading me. I told you I have plans.
It also says here -- that you are alert, astute, and quite imaginative --
I am?
Relax, Baxter.
I like the way you handled that. Well, how does it feel to be an executive?
Well -- I guess so.
You're not making sense, Baxter. What's this all about?
Now what was your news, Baxter?
The only thing is I'm staying at the Athletic Club -- and it's strictly stag so if you don't mind --
Sorry, Mr. Sheldrake.
What do you mean, sorry?
Baxter?
I know, Buddy-boy, I know.  But those things don't always run on schedule -- like a Greyhound bus.
I don't mind in the summer -- but on a rainy night -- and I haven't had any dinner yet --
Oh, yes.  She's the best operator in the building.
A lot of guys around here have tried it -- all kinds of approaches -- no dice.  What is she trying to prove?
Say, why don't we have ourselves a party -- the four of us?
It's not Picasso I'm calling about. It's the key -- to my apartment -- you were supposed to leave it under the mat.
Oh, I found a key there, all right -- only it's the wrong key.
We went to bat for you -- and now you won't play ball with us.
I hate to disappoint you -- I mean, many happy returns -- but not tonight --
I'm sorry if it gets noisy --
Want to tell me what happened?
Aren't you?
You know me with girls. Easy come, easy go. Goodbye, Doc.
Because as far as I'm concerned, he's a no good fink. Two weeks ago I wrote him a letter -- never even answered me.
That so.
Stuck on her! Obviously, you don't know me very well.
Who?
Sleeping pills.
I took sleeping pills.
Yes, I know.
How long has it been -- a month?
-- same sauce -- sweet and sour.
How do you think I felt -- riding home on that seven-fourteen train?
We didn't talk about it -- you did.
You're not being funny.
Okay. I'm sorry.
Are you sure that's what you want?
I'm sure. If you'll just tell me that you still love me --
I was never very good at history. Let me see -- there was Miss Olsen, and then there was Miss Rossi -- no, she came before -- it was Miss Koch who came after Miss Olsen --
And just think -- right now there's some lucky girl in the building who's going to come after me --
Of course I'm not here -- because the whole thing never happened -- I never took those pills -- I never loved you -- we never even met -- isn't that the way you want it?
I rented a car -- it's going to be here at one o'clock -- we're driving to Atlantic City.
Baxter?
Please, Sylvia!  It's a quarter to nine!
Sylvia -- sweetie -- it's not that -- but I promised the guy I'd be out of here by eight o'clock, positively.
You got to watch those things. Wives are getting smarter all the time.  Take Mr. Bernheim -- in the Claims Department -- came home one night with lipstick on his shirt -- told his wife he had a shrimp cocktail for lunch -- so she took it out to the lab and had it analyzed -- so now she has the house in Great Neck and the children and the new Jaguar --
Did you have a nice Christmas?
You came in on that boat, didn't you?
Moonby, 4th battalion, Royal Australian Regiment, Task Force. Ex-Corporal Moonby, deserted.
At least you always have enough water. How many gallons does each one of those damn things carry ?
A long time.
Yes, sir --
A sauciere --
That's right, sir -- I come from New Orleans -- I was raised to be a sauciere.. a great sauciere. We specialize in sauces; my whole family. It's what we do. I was supposed to go to Paris and study at the Escoffier School; I was saving the money. They called me for my physical so I figured the Navy had better food.
Chef -- since you're such a fan of Miss December's I think you should be detailed with Lance and Clean to take the first drum up there.
Probably is.
He killed that guy without feeling anything.
I don't get it -- You said your mission was to kill him. Let's do it, an' get our asses outta here. This  Kurtz is ruining the war; I mean, this don't look good for America !
Can I go get those mangos now?
Careful,  Captain, they've been known to charge.
Wow, you must a found the C.O., eh?
Signs?
Forget that extra drum -- it's too damn hot.
I only met Kurtz once.
Charlie?
Who is he?
Yeah.
Captain B.L. Willard, G-4 Headquarters, reporting as ordered, sir.
No, sir.
A lame ?
Of course. I -- Once we make our repairs, we could send word, we could have you evacuated from here.
I guess this is whAt men of war do -- eh?
I haven't surfed since I got here.
Mike, you know anything about the point at Vin Drip Drop?
Captain B-L. Willard, sir -- 4th Recon Group -- I carry priority papers from Com-Sec Intelligence 11 Corp -- I believe you understand the nature of my mission.
You talk like him. I don't mind taking casualties, Captain, but I like to keep my ratio ten to one in this unit -- ten Cong to one.
We'll come in low out of the rising sun -- We'll put on the music about a mile out.
Automatic weapons flashes along those trees -- probably eleven millimeter guns and AK-47's.
Why did you come to ... my province.
You were not coming here, to see me?
Pain is easy to handle -- but nobility.. the nobility of a man is judged by how much Truth he can handle.
Fuck no.
I'm gonna get you out of here.
Love him... Yes, it is true. That's the hard part for me... I knew him better than anyone ... I knew him best.
What's that?
He'll kill us.
Yeah... thanks.
Nah.
No -- no, Captain.
You think?
The other one --
Oh, you don't talk to Colonel Kurtz.  You listen to him. God, these are good. I kept these people off you, you know. It wasn't easy.
So Kurtz is alive.
Sounds like he's gone crazy.
Is that where he is? By the shrunken heads.
Well who the hell verifies that ?
What makes you so sure my boys won't be waiting for us?
212  CONTINUED:
39   CONTINUED:
Had some good years.  Met her in '66.  She showed up one day in Coldfoot.  No one knew her.  One Sunday morning, she marched into a bar and announced she was available as a wife to the highest bidder.  Didn't work out in three months, she'd return the money and leave, no hard feelings.  My bid was eight thousand dollars.  Beautiful girl.
The radio's on the fritz.
What are you doing?
He was sitting in a hot tub with a hooker.
You make it sound like a prison sentence.
It's exactly what you meant.
-- Permanently?
Be careful, okay?
Leave it here.
Yep.  Afraid you have me at a disadvantage.
Kenai at the general store asked me to bring these.  Didn't expect we'd already met.
Nice bluff the other day with the tranquilizer gun out your jeep window.  See you again, maybe.
A lot to ask, dragging him away from such a good-looking girl --
Ice is too thin -- you can see the water moving underneath.
Damn lucky this storm didn't blow down when we were on those baldheaded mountains.  It continues, we better stay put.
Nome?  I figure you'd be a whaler, coming from there.
Don't bet on it.
Why offer a buyoff with your gunmen waiting outside?
Can you walk?
Ben...boys.  Yeah, real slow, and I'd like to keep it that way.
I don't want to hurt you, Sam.
Mr. Desmond!  Arthur Neff.  Area rep for the Federal Assistance Plan.  Tell the boys in DC to keep those goodies coming.
Sure.
You don't mind me saying, Mr. Desmond, you look like hell.
Fuck you.
I'm too old for this shit.
That's what we should've done in the first place.
Why the smirk?
This man's friends ain't gonna look favorably on his incarceration.
Huh?
Do you really want to go back to the runt doctors in Emergency who keep telling us they can't help?
It lets a crazy man into our lives.
C-o-n-s-c-i-e-n-c-e. I got Sean from the bakery to baby-sit so let's go out.
I don't know... It's very strange not feeling that stupid panic thing inside you all the time. Without that you just start thinking about yourself -- and what does that ever get anybody. Today, on the bus there was this adorable couple and I felt myself giving them a dirty look -- I had no idea everything was...
Once the tests come back, is there someone I can reach in your office for the results?
The table's fine if it had some cholesterol on it. Two sausages, six bacon strips, fries, three eggs over easy and coffee.
Sorry.
You know he's a little dog. Next time, if Bryan's not here, you can bring him in.
And if I had to guess by your eyes. I'd say you were kind. So, so much for eyes. But as long as you bring up age...  how old are you?
Last week I was playing the piano for him and he likes it, and so I decide I'm going to make a little joke...
What needs clearing up?
I'm not kidding.
Okay!!!! Anything else?!?
So you'll be at work?
Hey, what I did for you is working out?
Well, part of what I said in this entire history of my life which you won't read is that somehow you've done more for my mother, my son and me, than anyone else ever has... And that makes you the most important, surprising, generous person I've ever met and that you be in our daily prayers forever.
I can't do this alone. I'm afraid he'll pull the stiff one eye on me. I need you to chaperon. Separate everything but cars. You said you liked convertibles. Now I'm on the hook.
My son.
Are you saying accepting your help obligates me!?
No... I'm not wearing that -- and just in case you were going to ask I'm not going to let you inject me with plaque either.
Two crab dinners and pitcher of cold beer.  Baked or fries?
That's maybe the best compliment of my life.
That's why you brought me? Look at me! Is that really why you brought me... Like I'm a what and I owe you what?!
Sorry, didn't realize she was right there.  Did you have sex with her?
Okay. Good-bye.
I don't know the last time I've been out of the city... Hey, my arms are tanning. I used to tan great. We gotta stop soon so'se I can check on Spencer.
Well...
Good night.
What the heck are those for?
I can help you if you take the responsibility to keep regular app --
Definitely a package you don't want to open or touch.
Police! Police! Fucking crooked police...  doughnut-munching morons help me!  Assault and battery and you're black.
You're taking him...  yes...  you're taking him -- this will clear the books. One night. You want to say "no" to me? Try...  because I've never felt as nuts as I do right this second. I almost want you to try saying "no."
How's Verdell doing?
Okay... so I'll see you tomorrow. Let's not drag this out. We don't enjoy another that much.
Yes, we do... And I can give you a tie and jacket.
Actually, I don't think so.
Shall I get her for you?
Just move on. No one here killed him.
Mr. Udall, I'd like to talk to you please.
I called. I never touched you. I didn't leave my name or nothing.
Please, just leave.
I told you to go on in.
You going to come talk to me or not?
What's it mean?
Why?  What happened?
But they caught the guy.  I heard it all.  Sounded like he just went berserk, fucking loco.  Shooting anybody.  Drugs, probably.
Sit back.  Put your seatbelt on.
You don't have to tell me that. It's just, I know my bid was low, but was it too low?  I mean, did I seem like an amateur, like I didn't know what I was doing?
Okay.
You don't know a fucking thing about me.  You don't have the slightest fucking clue.
No, the other Hotel Paraiso, in the city.  Near the Plaza del Sol.
I don't know what the fuck you are.
I have been sitting on a contract from Cleveland for six days because of you.
Nikita?  She helped me find you.
What?  How did you know I had a cat?
Who the fuck are you?  Who do you work for?
You want me to pump?
Okay.  How did you find me?
Nikita?
What does that mean?
Another contractor.
Someone hired both of you?
Yes.
And you want to use me to get him?
Don't tell me I don't have a choice!
This is something that is never going to end.  You can never work in the business again with this contract, because he will find you. To survive, you have to go into deep hiding.  And that's going to take money, a lot of money.
Listen -- I don't even know your name.
Had?
It looks like white's game.
Languages.  I was already fluent in nine languages.
You went from high school to the Agency?
Did it ever bother you?
Did it ever bother James Bond?
It helps me to focus.  It centers me, helps me think.
What will you do if this works, if we get the money?
Do you think he's here?
I know what you are thinking.  I'm not going to disappear, okay?  I'm not going anywhere, just down there, to that beautiful beach.  I got to get out of this room, just for a little while.
Not that I would know, but you look like you're really good at it.
That means you won't have a gun.
I don't believe that.
I waited until I was insane and then I walked into the bank.  He was sitting there, very calm, waiting for me.
Did you think they were newlyweds?
Thank you.
Isn't it interesting though?  I mean, look at us, in this room.  Or yesterday, when we were walking in the plaza market.  I mean, we look like just another couple.  But what are we?  Doesn't it seem so crazy?
No?
Yes.
Wait until he is on the stairs.
Electra --
I thought it was interesting --
Why are you working today?
But when you finLsh a job, afterwards do you think about them?
One hundred thousand?  That's it? Jesus... Is that a lot?
Everyone who plays the game knows the rules.
Go ahead.
You mean quit?
Yeah.
This will take some time.
Well, he sure seems fired up all of a sudden.
What about that squat bar you showed me, is that open on a Sunday?
I don't have the money for those Bourgeois traps. Hell, I'm making what a Czech earns.
I ain't sure poetry will go down too well here.
No, it's the whole idea behind it. How did they get this place?
Right and not just the bar, Lubosh and his mates took the whole freakin' building.
What we need is a space for real performance art. A cultural exchange for radical expressionism.
That makes you an expert I guess.
Yeah, you're in luck there's two of them, the other's in there.
Later Mate, right now I've got to do the locks on these doors so we don't have to climb through that bloody window every time.
I'll settle for a pardon. You gotta drill?
Wow!....What have you been doing, rolling around in it?
Perfect, but I can't use it right now, I've got to get these locks done; it's a matter of priorities.
Yeah, I'm beginning to see that.
I'd love to get in there.
No way, it's sealed - if she's in there she's dead.
Moved on to plumbing huh?
Just aiding and abetting if it makes you feel better.
Look at it this way, it's their contribution. If we'd explained it to them, they'd probably have given it to us anyway.
Couldn't keep your hands off the hired help, huh?
Take the drill back to Honza at the office, I promised to get it back for the weekend and I don't want to show my face there.
Shit no, it'll be twice cost.
WE gotta think of something.
Well, it seems they've dropped any charge relating to the files.
No point, it'll be in Czech and God knows what format. But if I'm right, they could be my ticket out of here.
What do you want me to do?
Sure....Anything else I can do for you?
Time for lunch I think. I'll get the sandwiches. What would you like Holly?
In return for Doug's freedom, I was never to see him again, I had to - it was his only chance.
You're sure?
Yeah, pretty well.
It's that one isn't it.
Doug?
Well, I'll try and get that clarified. As I understand it though, the charges include break and enter, theft, trespass, operating an unlicensed facility, vandalism and destruction of government documents - Whatever possessed you to start destroying people's medical records?
They didn't look like medical files to me.
Well a plea of ignorance won't go far here. Frankly, I think you deserve everything that's coming.
Doug, haven't seen you for a while.
Turned Czech huh?
I'll get the drinks, but not here. Let's split. I can't stand this any more, it's murdering my respect for literature.
No, I love you, really.
Then tell me, what will happen? Tell me!
Sure, they are students.
There's three thousand crowns, it's all I got.
I'll do my best. Is the place open.
No thanks, I must go, but maybe you could get some beers for the guys.
Yeah, great....Dobchay! It will dry, yes?
Ah, so what?
I'm in close with these guys, it isn't easy, but slowly they're opening up to me. Give me a month and I'll blow their movement wide open.
I don't know - maybe they are talking about it now. Mr Vitovetch is a good friend of the Judge.
What's the Bugler?
Why don't we both forget about him?
Weren't you going to get some glasses?
Why did you break into that particular building?
You are playing a very dangerous game, I suggest you make it easy on yourself and tell me where they are.
What is it you want?
I'm not sure it's possible.
Hey Doug, where you been?
You don't have fifty foot of apartment!
Give me a break, will you. How often do I ask you for something?
No problem, is it at your place?
What for?
Well, for a start, you've got to get cleaned up.
I don't want to go.
Why are there still such headlines?
Have you lost all control of this city?
That was not my decision, I can only guess that one day we will again be active and our honour restored. In the meantime no one else must know those files exist. Secure the building and I will arrange alternative safe storage immediately.
Kelly wouldn't do that.
I'm not hanging. I'm fixing my car --
There's hot cider in the kitchen.
I meant he's a doctor.
Now it's okay?
Deranged.
And that you're scamming on Jamie Sullivan.
I don't make small talk --
Were?
'They won't.'
You're like this fly, buzzing buzzing everywhere --
The reason I got the part... I'm a little like Lizzie. Except I don't worry about some man rescuing me.
Get very wasted. Lose your virginity --
Like you'd know.
I'll get something for us to drink --
I know. Don't say anything.
He's a softy. Got him wrapped around my finger.
What is that?
In ten words or less?
My relationship with God is my own.
You don't believe in anything?
The Bible. Why should I read a bunch of dumb stories about some ancient guy who supposedly worked miracles.
You don't know the first thing about being someone's friend --
Like fire.
Your turn.
What's wr--?
When did you build this?
Where's the one you're building?
Mars.
Now? We just --
I've talked to your father.
Maybe. But that's not the real reason. You think if I tell, he'll disappear and that's what you want! Me all to yourself!
No.
Materially or spiritually?
It's her decision and she's decided not to tell people -- at least for now.
I've almost finished the rocker. Did she order mirrors?
I'm using an old phonographic turntable.
Yes.
I'd do that --
No way. No thanks. I can't do it --
Thank you.
Scalene?
Well, well, he smirked when Marty opened the door. If it isn't the neighborhood bootlegger, Al Capone McFly?
Listen you little Asshole, I oughta --
Hot tip,  Rubber Biscuit in the third race at Arlington.
How was school today?
I think I know exactly what you mean.
Now, George! Dinner's ready now!
No, Chinese food is fine.
Why what?
Maybe if I used my left....
Yeah, explode it up your ass!
Well, yeah, I was thinking, if cars are gonna be going two or three hundred miles an hour, they're gonna be using an awful lot of gas. Like, what if we run out?
Good evening, one said. Agents Reese   and Foley, from the Nuclear Regulatory Commition.  Mind stepping over here?
What, am I radioactive or something?
Eight thirty.
Professor? Professor Brown?
A mall?
Professor. Well, not exactly, Professor. You see, we don't point it at the sun.
Look, Marty, she's not your mother yet. And if you don't go through with this, she may never be. I know it's hard, but there are some things we must do in life that are unpleasant. Some choices must be made that are difficult. Nonetheless, we must make them. Besides, this may be more than a simple question of your own existence, he added. The fate of the entire space-time continuum may rest on your shoulders . Marty tried to smile at him.
It was sure nice of Uncle Sam to put those yardage markers up for us. 
You see, I never rebuilt the time machine after it was destroyed in 1952. I decided that experimenting with time and possibly changing history was too risky. Anyway, experiments in time travel were banned in all 87 states after the governor of Cuba caught Dr. Felstien fooling around in the Bermuda Triangle -- that was back in '64.
What theater was I at?
No self confidence, I guess... At least you don't take after him.
No way!
Suzy!
Oh yeah?
No... You go in there, I'll have to kill you.
What you been doing?
Running this place for a fella in town. Nothing much to speak of.
What'd they look like?
I used to throw trash for the City.
You lost that one?
I need to get your signature on some papers here, Kit.
What're you doing?
What's going to happen to Jack and me?
Oh, incidentally, my last name is Carruthers. Sounds a little too much like "druthers", doesn't it?
Well, that I shouldn't be seen with anybody that collects garbage.
He'll say that?
Now what's he know about garbage, huh?
Yeah, well, I'm going to work as a cowboy now... Or thinking about it. It's a routine, like anything. What do you think?
Just don't... I've got a headache.
Did it go the way it 'uz supposed to?
But it would hurt.
Why?
How's he doing?
Is he upset?
I don't know.
No.
Well, maybe the slope here is throwing it off some. We ought to find a more flat place.
Never mind. It doesn't matter... If I'm worth a damn, I'll pick the right direction. And if I'm not, well, I don't care. See what I mean?
Hi.
Yes.
Well, matter of fact, I don't have any.
Just gimme a chance.
Hi.
Hold it right there.
Forgive the butterfingers, Buckaroo.  Casper Lindley, Knight of the Blue Shield, at your disposal.  And my son, Scooter.
There's another one we owe 'em.
Rawhide tells me Dr. Lizardo escaped...
Arachtoid.
Planet 10?  The same Planet 10 you postulated beyond Pluto, Perfect Tommy?  The invisible body?
What is it, Tommy?
All accounted for?  Where's Penny?
What is this thing?  A fighter?
Was she pretty?
I'd turn around, but I'm afraid you'd strangle me.
No.  Laramie.  Except I was born in Cody. How did you know that?  Oh, right, sure, I forgot: you know everything.
Open up or I'll shoot it off.
She was killed, Penny.
Oh, my.
Where's my damn ammo?  Nothing is ever where it's supposed to be around here!
I gotta be honest with myself and not repress these feelings-I've got mixed emotions-I don't know if I can handle this.  Oh, boy...
Please, Penny.  You just gotta trust me now.  Okay?  And don't panic. Because it's gonna be all right.
Stay here, I'll be back.
Buckaroo, come in...over.  How does this damn thing work?  Can anybody figure this lighter out?
What's happening with my call to SAC?
Still no confirmation either from SAC or Strategic Space Command.  They report all surveillance satellite communication jammed.
Pictures don't lie.
We're waiting for the Jet Car.  Billy's bringing it.
That's why I wear a fifty dollar hat.  Was a two hundred dollar hat, I hadda kill you.
No, sometimes he just... well, he thinks about Estelle. His wife still lives in Fayettesville. She's... disturbed.
Barton. Empathy requires... understanding.
Now that's all right, Barton. Everything'll be all right.
I write.
...No. I never saw him with anyone else.
W.P. Mayhew? The writer?
No son, thisahere moonshine's got nothin' to do with shuttin' folks out. No, I'm usin' it to build somethin'.
I'm a writer, Mr. Geisler. Ted Okum said I should drop by morning to see you about the 
Getting STARTED! Christ Jesus! Started?!  You mean you don't have ANYthing?!
Bill Mayhew! Some help! The guy's a souse!
I didn't say anything-
I can't write anything by tomorrow.
To do what?
Caught me trying to be fancy! Yeah, that's it, Bart.
Sure you could!  And yet many writers do everything in their power to insulate themselves from the common man  from where they live, from where they trade, from where they fight and love and converse and  and  and... so naturally their work suffers, and regresses into empty formalism and  well, I'm spouting off again, but to put it in your language, the theater becomes as phony as a three dollar bill.
You're all right, Charlie. I'm glad you stopped by. I'm sorry if  well I know I sometimes run on.
...This must be boring you.
Not at all. It's damned interesting.
Beery! You got no beef there! He's good.  Hell of an actor  though, for my money, you can't beat Jack Oakie. A stitch, Oakie. Funny stuff, funny stuff. But don't get me wrong  Beery, a wrestling picture, that could be a pip. Wrestled some myself back in school. I guess you know the basic moves.
...You're a little out of your weight class, but just for purposes of demonstration 
That's all right, really 
Because that would mean they gave you mine.
Well, my pleasure. I could use a little lift myself.
...Ah, you'll lick this picture business, believe me. You've got a head on your shoulders. What is it they say? Where there's a head, there's a hope?
Thanks, brother. But the fact is, I gotta pull up stakes temporarily.
I'm truly sorry to hear that, Charlie. I'll miss you.
What do you mean?
I didn't do this, I did NOT do this
Hold on. I said hold on, so hold on.
Sure, Charlie.
To be honest, I don't go to the pictures much, Mr. Lipnik 
Mr. Lipnik, I really would feel much better if you could reconsider 
L.A.P.D.
Ya know, Fink, ordinarily we say anything you might remember could be helpful. But I'll be frank with you: That is not helpful.
No, not yet Jack. We just bought the story. Saturday Evening Post.
Get down on your knees, you sonofabitch!  Get down on your knees and kiss this man's feet!
No.
It's fucked -- now will you please tell I.A. that I'm just you average healthy totally fucked-up cop and let me get out of here?
What are you talking about, Nick -- what's wrong with you?
My interest is in you, not in her. She seduces people, she manipulates --
What do you want, Nick?
I had him in two classes.
What are you doing here?
Are you arresting me?
Didn't you study it in school?
What did you think?
I thought you didn't do adolescent secrets.
You like to hang out with murderers or what?  Did you know Roxy --
I decided to give you one more chance.  I missed you.
I have to do some research tomorrow.
Really.  What are you writing about.
Why?
How did it end?
I'm John Corrigan.  I'm an assistant district attorney, Ms.  Tramell. Can we get you anything?  Would you like some coffee?
Listen, lady, we can do this downtown if you --
How's that?
Before your time, pop.  Mid-sixties.  Five or six hits. He's got a club down in the Fillmore now.
Forgive me for askin', son, and I don't mean to belabor the obvious, but why is it that you've got your head so far up your own ass?
She's a writer -- it's part of what she does.
Not unless she got up in the ring and turned into one mean sonofabitch.
Are you kidding me?
What is all this "Nick" stuff -- Nick would you like a cigarette. Nick can you give me a ride.
Her parents died in an accident. I don't care what else she's written.  What are you -- a book critic?
I don't think she meant to go off the hill, do you?
How old was she when this happened?
No Lisa Anderson, detective.
You're right. It's your version. You should come over to the studio sometime.
The whole thing  painting.
Nixon lives in Saddle River, New York.
It's in New Jersey.
Ten bucks apiece.
I can give you five. You didn't do very much to these.
Let's leave this town and go someplace. Some island.
Ouch..
That was my favorite part!
Gee. You shouldn't take it so seriously, Jean. That's why you can't stop taking drugs. You always think people don't like you. Everyone likes you.
Is Jean Michel here?
I'm interested in showing Jean's work.
I'd love to see some more of your work... Where's your studio?
It's great that people are interested, but if anyone's going to buy anything, I'll handle it for you. Everything goes through the gallery, even if they come to your studio.
How do you know?
A primate?
Oh, that's a "Leonardo's Greatest Hits" painting. You like it?
We don't hang them at home, y'know  just in the streets..
I see..  And... How do you respond to being called  hmmm...   yes, "the pickaninny of the art world."
Why, that's from Time Magazine.
Yeah, just put their bill on my tab.
Why don't you try letting her in, Steve  I mean Shenge.
Who am I?
SAMO.
You're shattering all my myths.
She's good.
Just come to the Mudd Club on Friday.
Wanna go get some breakfast?
... I'll buy you some new ones.
Hi.
How can I ever thank you?
Wanna Mac?
Singing on stage and painting in your spare time.
So shut up and keep painting..
Uh-oh!
Mr. Wayne ... Something wrong?
I will relay the message.
As I was saying:  I'm a woman, and can't be taken for granted.  Are you listening, you Batman you?
You've got a dark side, Selina Kyle.
I'd offer you coffee, but my assistant is using her vacation time.
If my life has had any meaning, that's the meaning.
Appetite for destruction? Contempt for the czars of fashion? Wait don't tell me ... Naked sexual charisma?
Precisely.  But they must come and go via the plumbing ducts that I've provided.  That shall be as sacred as the separation between church and state.
I'm the one you want!  Penguin, please!  Ask yourself:  Isn't it Max Shreck who manipulated and betrayed you?  Isn't it Max, not Chip, whom you want to see immersed up to his eyeballs in raw sewage?
Why, how industrious.  And how did you open protected files, may I ask?
Big giant <u>capacitor</u>.  And that, instead of generating power it'll sort of be --  -- <u>sucking</u> power, from Gotham City, and storing it ... stockpiling it, sort of?  Which, unless I'm being dense, is a novel approach, I'd say.
Selina?!  Selina ... Selina ...
You certainly will not.
What seems to be the problem?
Oxbridge Academy?
Hey, I'm the one who kicked Ivy's botanical butt.  Personally.  Me.  I did.
Al's main squeeze.  Is she here?  I'm about to scrape the bottom of my shoe off my tongue, right?
Paying someone to prepare your meals and do your laundry and clean your dishes, you call that family?
You were a great scientist once. Don't squander your genius on evil.
Nightwing.  Scourge of darkest evil.
I can't believe we were fighting over a  bad guy.
Can he save her?
Remember the victim at the airport. Toxins introduced through the mouth.
She knows who we are.
No sign of the snowman.
I see you knew him.
Acceptable losses in a battle to save the planet.
What?  I'm sorry.  You were saying...
What happened to his wife?
I checked the medical database.  No one else is even close.
One question.  When Batgirl and I rolled off the telescope, how come you didn't try and save us? It was the first time I fell and you weren't there to catch me.
Well, I, my most unabominable snowman, have been impressed by you. In fact I propose a pairing.  So I'm here to set you free.
There was nothing I could do.  Batman deactivated her.  She's dead.
Inspired, Ms. Ivy.
Okay, my hair is brittle, my skin is dry and I don't care.  I'd weather blizzards to have you. You're the most perfect man I've ever known.
What say we turn up the heat?
Forget your frosty femme.  These lips are wet and ready to get frostbite.
You're too late.  Say bye-bye birdie.
Then you'd have nothing to complain about.
I'm afraid Master Dick has... gone traveling.
Could I let Batman go? For Dick. For me. Could I leave the shadows? Have a life. Friends. Family...
So glad you could come.
Nostrovia.
Slanta.
The infamous Wayne charm. Does it ever shut off?
She's a Malaysian dream warden. She stands sentry while you sleep and calms your dreams.  Need one?
Patient apparently suffers from acute obsessional syndrome with potential homicidal styles. Work better for you?
So what you're saying, this guy's a total wacko, right?
I'm surprised you aren't blind by now.
Why do I feel like the other man, here?
Keep me off the couch, Doc. Your fees are a little rich for me.
So how goes your `scholarly' pursuit of Batman?
I don't want to remember!
Okay. I'm outta here.
Where's the boy?
Gosh, I could kill you, but then you'd miss my party. And you, Batman -- you're the guest of honor!
Look! Police!
Better. It's not on the market yet.
There's terror everywhere.  If you train yourself to look for it.
But it's not fair.  I'm half drunk and you're not even --
Maybe we should just kiss.
I realize... the way things have gone between us...  ... I wish you'd reconsider.
You're one man. You can't save everybody.
I answer to Grissom, punk.  Not to you.
Let's beat it, man.  I don't like it up here.
Gimme a break, will you?  Shut up.
You shouldn'ta turned the gun on that kid, man.  You shouldn'ta --
It's me.  "Sugar Bumps."
I've considered that possibility.
Please! We'll talk. Just tell us what you expect.
... Why the mask?
You okay?
I'm not sure I got the right person but they were a bit busy ...
He's not too bad.  I can live with him.
Oh, right, yeah.  two dollars please.
Oh Jesus.  Oh God.  Oh Jesus God.  Oh Mary Mother of Jesus. Oh Jesus of Nazareth.
What happened?!!!
Saw her at the movies the other night with that boss of hers.  Nice guy.  Good looking.
Great day.  At last we can start getting out of debt and concentrating on the future.
Lord Walton assures me this guy's one of the very top scholars in the English art world.  Has a couple of doctorates no less.
We'll be able to start this afternoon.  I'11 pipe the guide to every video screen in the gallery.  Now, that'll impress the Governor.
What a pleasure, Governor Reynolds.  I'd like you to meet some of our staff here. .
Glad to hear it.  Tell poor Mr Larson to come through, will you?
No!
A car sounds sensible.
All the guys they claim are English to and good-looking like Dan Day- Lewis and Liam Neeson, turn out to be Irish.  Even Anthony Hopkins is welsh.  Prince Charles is so ugly they pay him two million bucks a year to stay indoors.
Jen - you don't wanna talk about it?
It's you and Mom that need to talk.
Well, there is that ...
Why thank you sir.
I wish I could use that at school.  "Hey, Teach, no hard feelings ... It's just things between us ain't what they used to be and I need a little space, ya know?  So I'11 see you around in a couple of years, maybe".
Yeah, but check it out. It's gone!
No it wasn't!
Whoa, check it out Beavis. I didn't know Anderson had a Camper.
Oh, heh heh really? Cool. Heh heh.
Ow, let go, Butt-Head!
Check it out Butt-Head, TV!
Uh... Is this the right bus?
Hey, where'd those chicks go?
Yeah or like a Seven-Eleven or something... Are we almost there?
Aaaah. TeeeVeeeee, heh heh.
Yeah, we're gonna score.
Do you have T.P.? T.P. for my bunghole?
Talk ta me, Bork.
Chief, we found a witness that says he saw two teenagers leaving Dallas' room shortly before we arrived.
Damn right. Bork, we're dealing with real pros here. My opinion, terrorists... What's the scoop on that stolen unit?
Jesus Jumped-Up Christ! If this were to fall into the wrong hands...
Well, I'll be a blue-nosed gopher.
What the hell...? Bork! That bus we picked up. Where was it headin'?
Okay, boys and girls, our suspects are on a tour bus we believe to be headed for...  the White House! Jumpin' Jesus! I want everyone there. Our people. Locals. Orders are shoot to kill. Repeat! Shoot to kill!
Not on him, Chief.
Well, Earl said you guys were young, but jeez... Oh well, as long as you can get the job done. So what are your names?
Uh, yeah. Does she have big hooters?
You got two seconds!
Muddy! Sonofabitch! Hold it. What's he payin' ya?
Uh, ten uh...
Yeah it turned out okay.  We applied for a National Historical plaque for it.  That'll be the third one on Main Street.
I am sitting.
What?
Anything happen while I was away?
I can't clean anything.  The vacuum is out in the garage.  I can't leave the house.  Why don't they tell us something?  Where are all the other dead people in the world?  Why is it just you and me?
In heaven there wouldn't be dust on the wallpaper.
What's she doing here?
Oh, Adam, don't ever leave me alone.
She's got <u>photos</u>, Barbara.
I didn't do that one... Hmmm.
I am not going to expose that little girl to that... pervert down there.
<u>Adam</u>!  Why did you build a whorehouse?  Have you ever been to...?
What time is it?
What is going on?
<u>Barbara</u>?!!
Yes.  I evaluate individual cases and determine if help is needed, deserved, and available.
No.
Honey -- today I am three hundred <u>fifty</u> thousand dollars!
Oh, honey... I didn't mean anything ... it's just too big for you two. I know these things.
Cookie, they are dead, dead, deadski.
Of course they're dead.  They're ghosts.
Beetle!
No I don't.  I don't take orders from smurfs.
I can't believe that we're eating Cantonese.  Is there no Szechuan up here?  Hunan?
What do you think, honey?
Darling, can't you see I'm relaxing in here!
Stepmother's...
The attic room is locked --
Answer your mother.
I can't <u>bring</u> the ghosts.  They're not here!
Just a minute, Maxie.  Somebody...
I plan to have a stroke from the amount of MSG that's in this food.
It wasn't a joke.
The rest of the house is probably worse.  When can you and I get started?
Otho, I can<u>not</u> <u>live</u> with these cheap domestic floor tiles.
Maybe Charles does.
Yes, but I'm going to live at home.
Hellooo!  How's school?
The injection will ease the pain and swelling, Mr. Gardiner.
You were wrong, it did hurt.
You can pull your trousers up, now.
Oh, fine.
Just to take the proper precautions, Mr. Gardiner, I'd recommend we take you downstairs and X-ray your leg.  ... By the way, Mr. Gardiner, I would like to ask you something straight out.
Yes. Are you planning on making any sort of claim against the Rand's?
There's no need for a claim, the garden is a healthy one.
Oh, I see...  ... Well, then... You're a very funny man, Mr. Gardiner. You caught me off guard, I must admit...
Thank you.
... Oh.  ... My God, I only wish that Benjamin had your recuperative powers... Anyway, the President offered to sit in for Ben at the meeting, quite a nice gesture, I felt. He's due here soon, I believe.
Yes, Robert. I know about the President.
I would like to walk today.
I know exactly what you mean. Today the businessman is at the mercy of kid-lawyers from the SEC. All they want to do is regulate our natural growth! It's happening across the country!
And you, Benjamin, must be strong and brave for me. Turn over, please.
He's very intense, and internal, don't you think?
... He walked off...
I have no idea...
Oh. I have a message for him.
A Black man gave me the message.
Mr. Gardiner, I have a telephone call for you. Sidney Courtney, the financial editor of the Washington Post.
It's feeling better, but it's still very sore.
He was a very wealthy man, he looked after me since I was young.
I'll be all right, Chauncey you go ahead with Mrs. Aubrey...
And Benjamin sends along his best wishes.
How is Ben feeling?
Chauncey! Have you seen the papers?
... Is that all you want...?  ... To watch me...?
The President is a nice person. I enjoyed it very much.
Of course. But since he is ill I'm taking the liberty of asking you.
Mr. Gardiner, I'm Morton Hull, the producer of 'This Evening.'
I see.
Can you see well?
Yes. I like that name very much.
Yes, Eve. That would be good.
Sure you do. This ward is air tight, I have a little extra oxygen pumped in, keeps my spirits up.
... You know, Chauncey, there's something about you... You're direct, you grasp things quickly and you state them plainly. You don't play games with words to protect yourself. I feel I can speak to you frankly... You know what I was talking to you about last night?
No, Ben.
Certainly, Ben.
Yes. I would like to escort Eve.
Yes. I would like to go to Rand Memorial Hospital.
... Did you wish to see someone, sir?
Yes.
Some pictures...?
Can you walk? It's not broken, is it?
... My suitcase.
... Back up those stairs - damn... That Man's needin' me more and more just before he never needs me again...
He's dead, Chance! The Old Man's dead!
Then I got the hell out of that room and called the doctor and I think I woke him probably, he wasn't any too alert. He just said, 'Yeah, he's been expectin' it and said he'd send somebody over...' Lord, what a mornin'!
Your lunch? You have a luncheon appointment here?
I live here.
What are your plans now, Mr. Chance?
No headaches?
You heard?
I'm becoming quite attached to Chauncey - quite attached...  ... And so are you, aren't you, Eve.
Good evening, Wilson.
Sophie, this is Chauncey Gardiner...
Yeah... He and my father used to ride together back in the thirties... Fox hunting... Before I was born...
Yes? What have you found?
Gardiner, yes, sir.
Yes, Mr. President, we attempted to contact Mr. Rand, but he was too ill to...
What the hell are you talking about, Kaufman?
We have word that the Soviets have put out a top priority alert for information on Gardiner's background. So far, they haven't come up with a thing - what's more, as a result of their eagerness, one of their ablest agents blew his cover, we have him in custody at this time.
The rank-and-file in the FBI feel he is FBI, but others feel he is a CIA man who knows how to destroy FBI files.
A coup d'etat! Of course, that was foreseen by Lenin himself!
Big business. I could work with that faction quite nicely, Colonel Novogrod.
I'm sorry, too. Well, Nancy wanted me to send along her best to the two of you - and, Ben, I want to thank you for your time and thoughts.
You take care too, Bobby.
Why'd you do it, Craig?
Adorable. What time are they supposed to be here?
Yeah, just an idea I had.
Hi.
I'm sorry. How was your evening?
I want to try.
You weren't you. You were John Malkovich.
What's that?
We love her, Craig. I'm sorry.
I'm sorry. That was nasty.
It was lovely being you being Malkovich, my dear. I'd never seen the passionate side of sweet Maxine before, or her actual tits for that matter. If only, I've been thinking to myself, if only I could actually feel what Malkovich feels, rather than just see what he sees... And then, dare I say it, if only I could control his arms, his legs, his pelvis, and make them do my bidding.
I'm so glad you're safe. You look really wonderful.
I'm sorry for everything.
It's okay, Craig. It all worked out, in an odd sort of way.
Yeah. I was going to kill him from the inside.
I don't know. There's a small community of us. We have a place they don't know about. We're happy. We'll keep trying to figure out a way. Come stay with us. Join the struggle.
I'm through with puppets, Lotte. I just want you to know that.
Maxine...
That... was... no... simulation.
Please have a seat, Mr. Juarez...
Pardon?
Ah. yes, the little door.  There is a short film on the little door in the orientation room in exactly two minutes. If you hurry, you'll just make it.
More beet-spinach juice, my friend?
You're insane.
Is that true?
Well, truth is for suckers, isn't it?.
Listen. I'm Craig Schwartz, just starting out at LesterCorp.
How dreary - to be - Somebody / How public - like a Frog / To tell one's name - the livelong June / To an admiring Bog!
No, really.
Who told you?
You're not someone I could get interested in. Craig. You play with dolls.
This is important!
Tickets to Malkovich?
Okay. Here it is.  Ever want to be someone else? Now you can. No kidding. Only two hundred dollars for fifteen minutes. Visit J.M. Inc., Mertin-Flemmer Building. etc., etc.
No. Don't be an ass.
Maxine says she'll leave him if he leaves Malkovich, plus he's been challenged to a puppet-duel by Mantini.
The Great Mantini?
Well, if Mantini wins, Schwartz will leave Malkovich, right? So, if he needs it, I help Mantini's performance a bit, give him an edge. Spice up the show.
Yes, my dear?
Says me. Do you dream often?
You're crazy to let go of a chick who calls you Lotte. I tell you that as a friend.
I don't know anything about her. What if she's some sort of witch or something?
Oh, be still my heart.
But why, Son of Malkovich?
I have to see you. Can you call him and invite us over?
But Maxine, I thought it was me you loved.
Did you see the reviews?
No.
Do you mind?
Yes, yes, sweetheart, yes!  What the fuck is going on? I'm not talking. This is not me!
Well, we'll have all the money in Malkovich's bank account, plus he still gets acting work occasionally.
Captain Mertin?
The Word. What you was put here to speak.
But you got to do it. You got to. Can't nobody Call like you. You have to be there.
You saying God give up? Nothing left for us but pour out our own blood?
You punishing Him, ain't you?
Was a time I knew what was.
We have to be steady. "These things too will pass". What you looking for? A miracle?
DID YOU COME FROM THE OTHER SIDE.
YOU CAME BACK BECAUSE OF ME?
You gave me the bad dreams. You left me behind...
No. Not a bit all right. Hasn't gotten out of bed since that day.
That girl...You know, Beloved...
She gone like they say?
Haven't seen her since that day. Ella thinks she might be waiting in the woods for another chance but..I don't think so. Mama thinks she's gone for good. Says she can feel it.
You grown.
What you want'em for?
Yes ma'am.
They good whitefolks?
I want to work, Miss Lady.
Extra?
Food. My mama, she doesn't feel well. I couldn't stay away from her too long, cause of her condition but I could do chores in the mornings.
She likes to see you off in the morning.
Where you been keeping yourself? I told John must be cold if Stamp stay inside.
Out where?
I know Denver.
Sethe. He took up with her and stayed in there and you don't want nothing to-
I ain't sure I know that. Baby never laid eyes on her till she showed up here. And how'd she make it and her husband didn't? And where is he? And how she have that baby in the woods by herself? Said a whitewoman help her. Shoot. You believe that? Well, I know what kind of white that was.
Aw, no, Ella.
Till she showed herself.
I run him off.
Sure he knew her. Her boy Halle, too.
You mind loaded with spirits. Everywhere you look you see one.
You shaved.
Don't you die on me!! This is Baby Suggs quilt. Is that what you planning!?
She left me. She's gone again.
What the hell you thinking, girl? Strolling in here this late?
Make it the way I always do.
Dude, uh, tomorrow is already the tenth.
Yeah, yeah I know. Okay.
We've had some terrible news.  Mr. Lebowski is in seclusion in the West Wing.
Mr. Lebowski asked me to repeat that: Her life is in your hands.
Shit.
You don't know shit, Lebowski.
Hey hey, I'm not messing with your special lady--
Come and get it.  Fucking nihilist.
What do you mean, Dude?
I'm shomer shabbas.
What do you need that for, Dude?
Fuck you man!  You don't like my fucking music, get your own fucking cab!
And this is the study.  You can see the various commendations, honorary degrees, et cetera.
Uh-huh.
These are Mr. Lebowski's children, so to speak--
Different mothers, huh?
Heh-heh--
--smoking thai-stick, breaking into the ROTC--
And what do you do, sir?
No.  Here.
I like your style, Dude.
I've heard the kidnapping story, so save it.  I know you're mixed up in all this, Dude, and I don't care what you're trying to take off her husband.  That's your business.  All I'm saying is, I want mine.
Of course, there's that to discuss. Refill?
In a sense, yes.  Elfranco, my robe. My art has been commended as being strongly vaginal.  Which bothers some men.  The word itself makes some men uncomfortable.  Vagina.
Oh yeah?
Excuse me?
You mean coitus?
And please don't call her my mother.
Well--yeah, I guess--
Well, no, not exactly.  It's a complicated case, Maude.  Lotta ins. Lotta outs.  And a lotta strands to keep in my head, man.  Lotta strands in old Duder's--
Tell me a little about yourself, Jeffrey.
I was, uh, one of the authors of the Port Huron Statement.--The original Port Huron Statement.
Bunch of assholes.  And then, you know, little of this, little of that. My career's, uh, slowed down a bit lately.
Huh?  He's fucking loaded.
But your father--he runs stuff, he--
This was, uh--
So who--
I'm saying, Cynthia's Pomeranian. I'm looking after it while Cynthia and Marty Ackerman are in Hawaii.
No, you're not wrong--
Am I wrong!
Huh.
Well, there isn't a literal connection, Dude.
What the hell is this?
My dirty undies.  Laundry, Dude. The whites.
Thaaaat's right, Dude.  The weight. The ringer can't look empty.
What the fuck is going on there?
We're screwed now!  We don't get shit and they're gonna kill her! We're fucked, Walter!
I'm throwing the money, Walter! We're not fucking around!
You didn't think I was rolling out of here naked!
Whose toe was it, Walter?
Yeah, thanks Walter.  That gives me a very secure feeling.
Who gives a shit about the fucking marmot!
All but one man died?  There at Bitter Creek?
The bulk of the series.
Erev shabbas.  I can't drive.  I'm not even supposed to pick up the phone, unless it's an emergency.
Well it's, sometimes the cathartic, uh.
I'm saying if he knows I'm a fuck- up, then why does he still leave me in charge of getting back his wife? Because he fucking doesn't want her back, man!  He's had enough!  He no longer digs her!  It's all a show! But then, why didn't he give a shit about his million bucks?  I mean, he knew we didn't hand off his briefcase, but he never asked for it back.
I'm as Jewish as fucking Tevye
Goddamnit Walter!  You fucking asshole!
You make everything a fucking travesty!
What about that shit about Vietnam!
Yeah?
Dude.
I'll say it again, all right?  You told Brandt.  He told me.  I know what happened. Yes?  Yes?
Well no, like I said, Woo peed on the rug--
Come on, man, I'm not trying to scam anybody here, I'm just--
Are you employed, sir?
Dude.
Where's my goddamn money, you bum?!
Well. . . yeah.
Oh, shit.
Bullshit. Walter!
YOU THINK I'M FUCKING AROUND HERE? MARK IT ZERO!!
He's all yours. And I'm not your partner.
Blade.  We've got six Reapers.  They're all dead.
Why?
It means "bloodbrother."
What do you want me to do?
Did you think I wouldn't?
Where were you, Whistler?
And so will we.
Motion sensors.  Looks like Zone Three.
He was here.  Watching us.
Kiss your ass goodbye, Reinhardt.
So that's down and dirty.  Got anything to say for yourself?
Listen, hillbilly, you are a cunt-hair away from cowboy heaven.
I would hate to think you were losing your perspective.  Who do you think God favors in the web?  The spider or the fly?
Whatever --  What'd you do to the Charger?
Gave it a more aggressive exhaust profile ramping.
Fuck yeah.  Whole package'll crank this betty up another three-hundred horsepower.
This whole deal's giving me a serious case of the butt-willies.
Tweaked the phosphor rod, modified the collimated beam, wanna concentrate the light, get something like a UV laser going.
So how long have you known Blade, anyway?
You little shit.  When did they get to you?
I had to increase the dose. You're building up a resistance to the serum --
How can you be out here?
Why not? The future of our race runs through your bloodstream. You've got the best of both worlds, Blade. All of our strengths and none of our weaknesses.
Oh, so it's back to pretending we're human again, is it? Spare me the Uncle Tom routine. You can't keep denying what you are. You're one of us, Blade. You always have been.
Who is LaMagra?
The Day Walker's blood is a disparador -- a trigger, you see? For LaMagra's return. One need only consume it and the spirit of his ancestors will settle upon him.  "And the Sleeper will rise from the shadows anew, cleansing the world in a Tide of Blood."
You shouldn't be here.
And you honestly expect me to believe all this?
Because they're vampire wanna-bes. If they're loyal, if they prove themselves, then their masters will turn them.
You can't do this, he's human, it's murder.
Look, if what you say is true, if there's a chance I could turn into one of them, then I've got no choice, do I? I have to work with you. I need to learn everything I can about them. It's the only way I'll be able to find a cure for myself.
What are you looking at?
Looks like we hit pay-dirt. This place is crawling with them.  See the valets over there? They're vampires. So is the doorman.
How can you tell?
My mother used to say that a cold heart is a dead heart.
You don't look so good.
Get out of here --
I'm not leaving without you.
-- tearing me -- apart.
I was afraid that might happen.
Maybe it's time to start exploring other alternatives.
Deacon brought me back.
Then what is it?
That's weird --
-- but then I remember what an ass-hole you were and I'm snapped back to reality.
The shadows suit us, Frost. We've existed this way for thousands of years. Who are you to challenge our ways?
What -- ?
Why do you hunt them?
I had a family once -- a wife, three daughters. Then a drifter named Deacon Frost came calling one evening --
Their own blood can't sustain hemoglobin.
How?
'Give you a hand. I think my sleep for the night just ended.
A coward too. That's why she had to go.
Not that I can see.
--Jamie Kurth, Jonathan Edmunds--
--but she was nicer then--sweeter-- she hadn't vomited twice already like today--
Whatzername--the "psychic" Anna hired.
Your body, your call.
Why is there no "our" here?
You said the name "James."
--or someone--
For once could you just sit down, shut up, and give something a <u>chance</u>?
Just...try and go back to sleep.
Then I'm going--
I know, I know.
<u>One</u> set. Everything from midnight on--
How'd you know they were--
Oh, who did then? Blair Witch? Snatching equipment to make her own sequel?
Something happened to Anna in Burkittsville, in the woods, I don't know.
Turn the tapes back on.
Does it hurt?
So lemme see it.
That's what Josh and Mike said.
Get inside quick, they'll stop.
Boy Kurth.
Yeah. Me too.
--into the <u>Black</u> <u>Hills</u> with--200- something miles from here--
Nobody's going anywhere--
--hell, I don't think I'm ever leaving this place again--
Cotter?
<u>What</u>?
Let's get inside.
Running a junk yard.
Well, she's got to be <u>somewhere</u> here.
Chrissake: why <u>any</u> of this?
Oooh. Oooh.
What?
What'd you see?
He'll never know.
Dad...?
Jesus.
What're you afraid's going to happen?
--bullshit--
She's off her fucking rocker--
What?
Gothic rune--the letter "S."
Like a blueprint for disembowelment.
--yes--
Abby. What's the matter?
Jesus, I got a hangover. Want a drink?
Meurice--
You wouldn't be putting me out.
...Well I'll be damned.
When you don't they're usually nice.
Abby... you all right?
...You all right?
...That's the only thing they told us in the service that was worth a goddamn--Where the hell's my windbreaker?
...You leaving?
...So?
Remy.
You won't have to. I'll explain what a palate is.
Christ, I'm getting bored.
Uh-huh.
...What're you gonna do in Houston?
Abby, I like you, but it's no point starting anything now.
Yeah.
I want that money. If you wanna tell me something, fine--
What did you take these for?
For the money.
...There's a big--
...I just made a call about that. It'll look fine.
You said the usual--
Deuce in the corner needs help.
Meurice. Sorry I didn't show last night.
Sometimes it helps to talk things over. for instance, many marriages are saved by.
By the way, Jeffrey, this story isn't going to the press and I'm going to ask you to consider all you've heard strictly confidential. Do not discuss this business with anyone, but me, or other police personnel. Got it?
Come into the study a minute.
Detective Williams here. yeah. Tell him to go to Sergeant Milton. yeah, copy.  Well, Jeffrey, you found something which is very interesting to us. Very interesting. I know you must be curious to know more.  But. I'm afraid I'm going to have to ask you not only not to tell anyone about your find, but also not to ask more about the case. One day. when it's all sewed up, I'll let you know all the details. Right now, though. I can't.
Yes.
I guess you've seen some bad things.
What color is it?
I have no hard proof of any of this. Her address is also on the photos. I think these people are involved with drugs. and murder. I think Frank is killing drug dealers and.  . and somehow Frank is getting all their drugs. I had to tell you I got slightly more involved in this than you wanted me to, but it's over now for sure. .I had to tell you about these things in case it could help.
Because of your information I alerted internal affairs to check out Detective Gordon.  I had to keep on with him as if nothing was different.  He slipped off on his own when he found out we were going to raid Frank's place.
Frank gone?
Yeah, maybe so. Frank's got me. and you. and really it's all thanks to Don. isn't it. remember that. Your husband was the one who started fucking my mind with drugs.
Pest control. gotta do your apartment.
Oh God, that stuff stinks.
Jeffrey.
An experiment? Hey, I've seen you before.
NO, you come on. Take off your pants. I want to see you.
Look. I'm sorry. Just let me leave.
Sure I'm alright. 
Thank you. honey.
No. What is happening?
There you go again. stop saying that. You can make it.
Are you a bad boy?
I want you to hurt me.
I'm glad you do.
Yes.
I guess I should go.
I'll call you.
I'm getting a little bit fat. I hate that.
You seemed to see some very interesting things on your little escapade with Dorothy Vallens.
What?
Oh yeah?
Terrible. boring.
It's a strange world isn't it? Do you know what building the woman lives in?
What's the plan.
What's with Mike?
Yeah?
No, silly - I'm still in school you know. but I'll meet you after school and you can tell me what you've learned. You better be careful, Jeffrey.
Goodnight.
Number two. I saw the Yellow Man come out. This time with a well-dressed man with an alligator briefcase. They drove down this factory building and stood on a staircase looking at something in the distance. Number three. now get this. In the distance was a murder. a drug dealer shot to death and a woman with her legs broken.
Really?
Hi Dad.
How ya doin' Dad?
Sandy?. Could I talk to you a minute?
Pleased to meet you finally, George.  I am Augusto Oliveras.
Norman Cay is not a person.  He is an island, George.  In the Bahamas.  From what they say, it is free and it's Diego's new home.
Alright.  I'll ask Pablo, tell him it's for you.  I don't think there will be a problem.
Five-thousand per kilo.
This is it for me.
Tuna, this is crap.
Really.  Are you getting paid, Mr. Jung?
I'm doing sixty years at Otisville, no chance of parole.  Even if they cut my sentence in half I'll be seventy-three years old.  That's some fucking deal.  I don't know if the parole board, the judge, the pope or Jesus Christ himself can get me out of here.  I have a really bad record, I'm not sure what's going to happen.
What?  Yeah, sure.
I know what you want.  But, first of all, are you cops?
We're not cops.  We're from Massachusettes.  I mean, does he look like a cop?
What the fuck is that?
I lost sight of everything.  Forgot who my friends were.
I want my kid out of protective custody. Now.  No fucking around.  My wife and my kid on a plane tonight.  I sign when they call me safe and sound.
What?
I don't like a lot of conversation, Diego.
Only two ways I know to leave here early.  One is to escape.
Because they caught me?
That's over fifty-thousand dollars profit per kilo.
What type of planes do you have?
How are we doing?
Good to see you, Diego.
I know.
And what happens when these guys stop paying?  Sooner or later, these guys are going to cut us out.  Then where are we?
And keep only forty-percent?  No thanks.
Jesus fucking Christ, Diego.  I ain't telling you.  It's just business.  Now, shut up.  You're driving me crazy.
Take it easy!  Everything's okay!
Estoy bien, okay?  Everything is alright.  There's no problem.  Okay? This never happened.  No one has to know anything about this.  Diego, I want you to calmly tell them where the fucking coke is.  Do it now.
What?
Coke.
Take your boots off.  You're tan.
That's right.  Layaway.  Something you wouldn't know anything about, you cheapskate.
So, this is the man who takes fifty kilos and makes them disappear in one day?
Yes.
It's beautiful.
Keep them coming.
You know why I'm here.  You know what I have to do.  I came here for permission. Out of respect, Pablo.  This is bullshit, he's making me look like a punk.
Look what the cat dragged in.
Why are you smiling?
I don't know.  My name is George.
What do you want me to say?  I'm in prison.  You should know.  You put me here.
Yeah.  She told me.  You walk her to school.
Is she here?  Is she coming?
Well, I got a call from Pablo.  He said this thing with Diego is a disaster. He's giving up lab locations, names, bank accounts, he was very pissed off. Pablo said to take him down.  His exact words were "Fuck Diego."
Everything's gonna be okay, sweetheart. Don't be upset.
Kristina, c'mon, I'm sorry.  I'm going to make this right.  I've got a few things going on...
Let me ask you something.  If you could go anywhere in the world, anywhere, where would you want to go?
Yeah.
Swear on my life.
Shhhh.
But I have a visitor.
It's a four-man operation.  Two on the ground.  Two in the air.
Marijuana is illegal in my country, and I believe in yours, as well.  We must be careful.
G-d, I'm stoned.  I'm stoned.  I'm really...
Not that far, only halfway.  You sure you know what you're doing?
I can't believe we're stealing a plane.
It is an inevitable stage in revolutionary war; from terrorism, one passes to insurrection ... as from open guerrilla warfare one passes to real war, the latter being the determining factor ...
Dien Bien Phu?
Second name.
Which "district" do you belong to?
Third group.
C'mon ... you're exaggerating. The orders were to shoot him in the back.
No, immediately. The people are demoralized. Leave this to me ...
Can you read?
It's good nobody is following us ...
It's clear. They'll do everything possible to make it fail.
No, and neither were my men.
Are you ready, colonel?
How you doin' Mister D?
I've been waiting for you to get back.
Charlie -- are you going to make a point soon?
You did a good job, Charlie.
For starters I'd like to know why she left the house and didn't report the death?
What are you saying, Henry?  That his girlfriend fucked him to death?
Was the heart attack the result of natural causes?
I don't think so.  The membrane in his nasal passage didn't show any sign of long time usage.
Yes.
Well -- he died on a Sunday and I have the weekends off -- but they were ripping at each other with both barrels Friday afternoon.
He was away on an extended vacation and just returned two days ago.
No questions.
Lookin' to make the papers, John?
I'll tell her but she won't take it.
Really?  What does an attorney speak to his client about at her house until three o'clock in the morning?
Six years.
What about Miss Lawson?
For about one year.
Fine.  The doctors say if I keep taking care of myself I can live to be a very old man.
How did your relationship with Miss Lawson progress after the surgery?
She started touching herself and telling me how much she wanted me. She reached down and put me inside her.  My doctor had warned me about exerting myself -- but you really don't think of those things at a moment like that.  You just think about how beautiful this woman is -- how much you want her.  How deeply you want to please her.  At first it started off slowly -- but the rhythm built and built.    Every time I got close to an orgasm she would stop.  Eventually I started to have trouble breathing.  Rebecca just kept going -- faster and faster.  No matter what I said she wouldn't stop. I really thought for a moment I was going to die.
I was angry.
I may have been infatuated with her - - but I wouldn't perjure myself.
Dr. Trammel, did you ever speak to Miss Lawson about Mr. Marsh's condition?
Yes.  I've been seeing her for over a year.
I tell them to pour an amount the size of a quarter into the their hand and mix it with water.
October twenty-seventh.
Yes.
Where did you meet him?
What did he say?
I don't know.  It's incredible to think that anyone could be capable of doing that -- but if anyone could it would be Rebecca.
He said that if it kept up she was going to kill him.  That his heart couldn't take it.
Well, think about it.  Isn't it possible?
He video taped you.
Well - I'm a little confused.  This is a charge receipt from Rosen's Drug Store where Mr. Marsh had an account.  It's dated the day of the murder.  Is this your signature?
There's an item you picked up that's marked.  Will you read it?
You see that's what bothers me.  No other bottle of nasal spray was found in the house.  The police looked. There was only the one bottle.  But you say you didn't arrive until after Mr. Marsh was dead -- yet we know he was using the nasal spray prior to his death.  How do you think it got there?
Isn't it true that you put the cocaine in the bottle?
Yes.
What do you have in your purse?
You must have some feeling.  Some immediate impression.  A young, attractive woman, involved with an older man who leaves her everything in his will.  And the things that went on in that house.  Such wild sex.  What kind of picture does that paint?
Have you ever seen animals make love, Mr. Dulaney?  They have such passion -- such savage emotion.  They struggle, and snarl, and claw, but neither hurts the other.  Not really.
Why not?
Why not?
Because, I'm your attorney.  I shouldn't be going to your house.
Sorry.
It's going to be hard to convince a jury that he's testifying against you in a murder trial because you blew him off.
You lied to me!
It isn't true.  You have to believe me.
No, I don't have to believe you.  The jury has to believe you and answers like he's lying or she's mistaken aren't going to convince them.
I don't use cocaine anymore.  If she says she saw me doing it she's lying.
Alone?
I'm glad you have such confidence in me.
Sugar or honey?
You killed him.  You killed him -- and I got you off.
How's it supposed to work Rebecca? You and Paley celebrate your victory. You get me over here and provoke a fight so he has to rush in and save you -- but then he's given himself away as your accomplice -- now he has to kill me.  After that I figure she'll tell the Police that you broke in.  That you were crazed because we humiliated you in court?
We've already got press arriving from over the country and she hasn't even been charged yet. Cardenas wants to see her in his office tomorrow at ten.  I'd like you to go with her.
Mr. Dulaney, before you cast aspersions on the District Attorney's Office by suggesting they've coaxed this witness to say things that aren't true -- you better have more than a hunch.  Do you?
Are you able to back up this allegation -- or are you fishing?
You're on vacation, remember?  You're supposed to be relaxing.
I don't know yet.  I want to hear what she says at her statement tomorrow.
Frank -- I know you're busy, but Michael asked me after dinner if you were angry with him.  He wanted to know why you weren't talking to him.
I'll talk to him later.
We can't pretend this isn't happening.
Not even if they're a dork?
I nearly died when we split the bill.
Maybe it's an Italian thing. Their mother was Italian.
Eeeww!
I thought everything WAS arranged.
What?!
That would be some trick. He's already dead. That's what this other letter is.  From his attorney. He left most of his things to mama and requested... 
My Lord. It must feel real nice living inside your head with Peter Pan and the Easter Bunny.
Grateful!?
Bar across the street.
I found out who Lucy Delaney is.  Remember the Delaneys from Hillcrest Road?
Boy. All these years I've resented not living the wild life in some place like Paris and all the time I could've moved back to Iowa... Are you drunk?
Not officially. Her and Steve Kendall were pinned at birth. But I was crazy about her. And for about three months, I managed to catch her during her "exploring" stage.
-- for over twenty years because that's what I was taught -- you stick with it! Normal people don't get divorced. I can't remember the last time my husband made love to me so intensely that he transported me to Europe, for Christ's sake -- quite frankly, I don't think he ever did! And now I find out in between bake sales, my mother was Anais Nin!
Madge?
I don't know. I woke up a little dizzy. I didn't sleep well. I think I need to lay down.
Pretty country.
No, I don't mind. I'm not from here. I was born in Italy.
Oh, that's nice.
Richard was in the army. I met him while I was living in Naples. I didn't know where Iowa was. I only cared that it was America. And of course, being with Richard.
I better go. You sure you're all right?  It's been a pleasure. Sincerely.
Help cook?
Then what happened?
"Making pictures." I like that. You really love what you do, don't you?
You sound like an artist.
No. It's all right. I just meant, it might be a little dull for you, telling all this to some housewife in the middle of nowhere.
Have no fear. This Shoshone Medicine Woman taught me how to make bug repellent tea out of tree root.
You sure you won't let me help you with those dishes?
Yes.
So what happened?
Why doesn't it scare you?
Just because someone chooses to settle down and have a family doesn't necessarily mean they're hypnotized. Just because I've never seen a gazelle stampede doesn't mean I'm asleep in the world.
Listen, I have to shoot Cedar Bridge until a little after sunset. I want a few night shots. Would you like to come with me? If you're interested...
I'll pick you up.
I uh... I had lunch in town today. Happened to cross paths with "that Redfield woman." I apologize. I thought you were half-joking about that.
Sure.
You want to eat something?
I just feel like I'm getting a little ... out of control that's all. It's kind of frightening.
And arraccinos and zeppolis. Yes! I know it!
But you don't mind.
Where was she?
I... What do you want?
No matter how I keep turning it around in my mind -- it doesn't seem like the right thing.
For who?
The kids are grown! They don't need you anymore. You told me that. They hardly talk to you.
We are the choices we've made, Robert.
I don't know. Can we turn it off? I have such a headache.
Well, what's nice about her? Tell us!
Apparently just before her death.
Well, close the fucking door by all means.  But don't expect me to go down there and do it.
Hey, watcha doing with that dog?
Then what do you care?
Hey, kid.
Yeah?
The man said just to use my imagination.  Let's see...yeah, I get it.  Potential. I can see it now.  The first major urban theme park.  Village Ghetto land. Kinda like Legoland, but made entirely from broken glass, hypodermic needles and crack vials.  Totally E-ticket.
I believe in you guys.  You are the real shit.  And you know it.  Now I'm putting everything I got into this cuz I think we can make it happen, but you gotta put a little in too.  Now all I"m asking is that everybody do their part.  We'll move some shit in, and take shifts, or all crash together here --
I do alright.  Everybody's happy.
Gotta be an in-ey and gotta be smooth. If it's ragged, it was picked too soon. Won't ever be ripe.  Second, it's got to have just a little give, here.  At the edges.  And last, but not very far from least...  You gotta get your nose in it and give it a gooooood, looooong sniff.
I want you to do something for me, baby.
Trust me, Jimmy, there's big money behind this.  Not just big.  BIG.  Like big business big.  Big corporation big.  Big government big.  Our little acre alone'll net hundreds a thousands.  Nothing but net.
Aren't you going to join us?
Have you ever been inside?
It's alright, baby.
Naw.  But they will be.  They're the best.
Guess it's not Rossmore Park.  Thanks for the help.
Lucky thing.
You were just a kid.
What building?
I ain't killed nobody.  Shall I rack 'em?  Play a game, Lupe?
Fair enough for the shit.  But I think a little bonus is due for knocking out the competition.
Oh, no.  Please don't make me go by myself.  I'm scaaaaaaaaaared.
Jimmy Bones?
And some people need their medication tweaked.
Whoa, whoa.  Come on, he's making too much noise.
The next one blows off your dick.
We're family, Caesar.
I can't.  I can't.
I didn't expect --
Jesus, Caesar!
I was getting out of the car when I saw him in the Mercedes.
It was him.  I'm positive.
Violet, please!
Shut up, Violet!
Violet!
Stupid cunt!
Caesar, stop acting like an asshole and think --
Tell them I'm at St. Mary's off the Kennedy, in the waiting room, but stay on the phone until I come out.
Now that's teamwork.
You know he would have done you, too.
Caesar, don't.
How's it going tonight, fellas?
Fuck, this happened before.  It's this shitty ear.  Born with it.  The batteries wore out in my aid.  I'm sorry.
Try to keep the extra batteries for your aid around.
I should be going.
Yeah, Mick.  I've got the money. I'm staring right at it.
I thought I heard someone knocking.
Yeah.
Hello?
I'm sorry, it's just you hear stories.
My pleasure ...  but to be honest, I did have a slightly ulterior motive here.  I was wondering if I could ask a small favor?
Are they really?
Yes, it really causes problems. Sometimes it's like you're in the same room.  But if it's too much trouble, I understand ...
Do you have a pot or a bucket?
How did you meet him?
Five years is a long time.
Yes there is.  I felt it this morning when I brought you the coffee.
You didn't want to see me, did you?
What choice?
It started way before I was around. I think basically it's because he thinks Johnnie is a complete idiot. But Johnnie runs Chicago because Gino is his father.
Has Caesar ever seen him?
Where will you be?
Hey, Caesar!  You take care of this girl, or I find out!
No, Johnnie.  No goddamned phones. Not now.
Unbelievable.  Can you believe that, Violet?
No.  We can't risk it.
-- he went inside! --
Who are you?  Rome?  Paris?  Treadstone...both of us...I was warned but...
Paris.  I live in Paris...
I think so.
...yes -- oui -- uh...
Paris?
Well...  I must admit, when my assistant told me you were here I was, really -- I was quite -- I was surprised.
Let me get you a new copy of the proposal.
Look, I want a ride to Paris.  That's all I want.  I swear.
You could buy a car for twenty grand.  You could buy this car.
I don't want to go alone.  I want you to drive me to Paris.  Like we're a couple.  Like we're a couple and we're travelling together.  That's all we're doing.
What if I say no?
And you have no idea -- not a clue -- what came before that?
Why do I? -- I come in here -- instinctively -- first thing I do -- I'm looking for the exit -- I'm catching the sightlines -- I know I can't sit with my back to the door --
You were tired.  Here...  For twenty-thousand I like to throw in breakfast.  So what do you dream about?
Marie -- look at me -- there's no time for this --
You knew he was coming.
-- forget it --
Who is it?
xxxxxx
xxxxxx
I said, someone came last night --  Look, this isn't a carnival -- people call and they make an appointment and they follow the rules -- everyone signs in and out -- this is a serious place -- serious work -- it's not just to come in whenever you like --
Sir...
-- we're evacuating the building --
It came from your hip.  Under the skin.  You have a bank in Zurich.  You remember Zurich?
...Be back.
...ergency procedures.
You telephone, sir.
... yer ducts.
... new washer.
What? You mean you've got ...
I know he would have wanted me to help you ... And I promised your mother I'd take you onto the team at information Retrieval. But I gather that ...
Yes, you've got to get me out of here. I've got to find her.
Sam, if you've been going out there and playing a straight bat, all the way down the line, you've got absolutely nothing to worry about.
Problem? - No problem - yes, everything's going fantastically well, wonderful, marvelous, great career prospects, Alison in great shape, kids fine, beautiful home, I'm on Security Level Five now, and Mr Helpmann relies on me more and more, yes, couldn't be better, I feel terrifically motivated and job- rewarded -
Hello, Jack!
Er, I knew you looked different.
Jack!!
Enough though, eh?
Sam, there are very rigid parameters laid down to avoid that event but Buttle's heart condition did not appear on Tuttle's file. Don't think I'm dismissing this business, Sam. I've lost a week's sleep over it already.
Er ... no.
Tell me about Layton.
But surely, I mean, perhaps she just happened to live above the Buttles, and ...
Look after that suit, eh. Barbara chose it for me.
Look, about the Layton woman - maybe she's just trying to help the Buttle family.
But, I've already put her on the search and detain list.
Take her off the list.
Well, I'd better get out there and try to get to her before security does. Let me borrow her dossier for a while.
Come off it, Jack! Of course you can check to see if she's been arrested.
I'm sorry, Sam, I'm afraid this whole case has become much more complicated since last we talked.
Jack, she's innocent!
No, there's no stamp on it. You see! I can't give you the form until it's stamped.
Where do I get it stamped?
Are you alright?
... This is amazing ... for me ... being here with you. I mean, in my dreams you ...
Yes. Ceiling. Why did you run away?
I didn't like it.
Where are you taking me?
Why don't you say, no system is perfect.
Well, no system is.
Who will?
"And your children all gone."
This is a hell of a time to buy a nightie.
Go away.
........... It's a bomb isn't it?
Your face ... are you hurt?
They're gone.
Are you sure?
Make yourself at home. Don't answer the phone or open he door to anyone. I won't be long.
Where are you going?
Isn't it? Whose is it?
Really.
It's your mother isn't it? Pulling strings again.
The refund for Tuttle!
Send it to somebody else. Send it to Buttle. It's his cheque.
Dead! Oh no! That's terrible! We'll never get rid of the damned thing! What are we going to do?
Here. What do I do next?
Oh God! I think I've broken a bone. What a pathetic thing I am.
Damn! Blast!
What's the matter?
You don't happen to know how I can get around an IRQ/3 do you?
I know that.
I never signed the form.
My mother said it would be all right.
Is Mr Helpmann here?
Ah ... hello, Mrs Terrain. SAM lets go of the parcel and pushes JILL away. She moves off.
This is an emergency!
Put the phone down and your hands up.
And you can't tell me what the proper channels are, because that's classified information?
Monsieur. Quel numero.
It's all right, Terry, it's all right, everything's all right.
For God's sake, what's happened?
You swore you'd fire me if I came in late again.
Es impossible.
She wanted something to help her sleep.
Did you give Mary something called Red Death?
They're gonna torch the fence. You're gonna feel the metal getting warm, maybe very warm.
I've been thinking about things. Meditating on my financial future. You guys gave me plenty of time to meditate on the future. Whatja do, stop for Chinese on the way over? There's plenty of food in my place.
Twelve Young, I don't have time for your games. Now answer me or do I have to come out there myself?
I'm not your baby, Young, I'm not your mother either. You're going to a cardiac arrest, Avenue C and Ninth, northeast corner. It's a club. Take the side entrance.
It's okay. They're prescription.  Works better with a little whiskey.
My father was a great man, you know. There was nobody he wouldn't help. You know that crazy guy Noel who I gave water to last night? He lived in our house for almost a year. A total stranger he'd do anything for, his own family though ...
It's been bad lately, but it's always bad.
Mostly. It must be my face. My mother always said I looked like a priest.
Nothing's going to happen. I'll come with you.
Promise you won't go inside.
Can I bring you something back to eat--a falafal, some pizza?
No, we just ate. I only remember how tough my father was. Now I know he had to be like that, to make us tough. This city'll kill you if you aren't strong enough.
Frank.
The ghosts--
Is it true that you and Love went on a blind date?  She hit you with a bottle?
Who's that?
Nice though, pulling back her hood as we drive by. There's a mystery to it, then she shows you.
She's no whore, Marcus.
That's too many.
What do you think?
I'm sick, Tom. I need a cure.  Vitamin B cocktail, followed by an amp of glucose and a drop of adrenaline. Not as good as beer, but all I got.
Whatja doing?
I've taken that into consideration.
C'mon, Tom, pick up a job.
Let's break something, Tom. Let's bust something, bomb something.
What's the reason? Give me a reason, Tom.
What?
I'm not hungry.
I eat. I just haven't had coffee yet.
I'm not feeling very well, Larry. I say we go back to the hospital and call it a night.
You take things too seriously. Look at us, we're cruising around, talking, taking some quiet time, getting paid for it. We've got a good job here.
Okay.  Pretty petty party, isn't it, pal?
I made one rule for myself when this started and I realized I was going to take a lot from you people because of being from sports...
Yes, Aaron.  I know the names of the Cabinet.
No.  That's not going to tell us anything.  Let's get this prompter going.
A half hour in the lobby.
Okay.  Let's do me.
They didn't hire Peter Stiller from the <u>Times</u> and he had a great audition tape.
I didn't sleep.  They're giving me less and less air time.  They don't think I'm at all anchor material.
I think the pilot that shot down the Libyan in 1981 is stationed right here.  Maybe you could get him -- and maybe Tom should say that our F-14 is one of the hardest planes to fly. They're nicknamed 'Tomcats'.
Define your terms.
Do you feel good about it?
Why not try it for a few weeks?
Stop.  Ernie thought I was good too -- he couldn't help.  My agent has a hot prospect -- the number two station in Portland.  The general manager says he wants to be every bit as good as the networks.  Personally, I think he should aim higher.
I saw the smile -- good piece.
Outside?
Wait.  Bullshit me a little...I'm beginning to appreciate it.
Ah, damn -- the fucking jerks -- My, God.  They want to fire me.
Goodbye, Paul.
I'd like to take everyone out after the show.
Bill...This is hard on all of us and it's no time for compliments. But I think it's extraordinary of you to come down here for this.
Yes, it's true.  They're going to make it public Wednesday but isn't it a big deal for you to have it a day and a half early?
...good-bye then.
Ernie, they're calling from work.
How horrible.  We'll be fine.  You'll be fine.  Stay here with me -- we'll go for a drive, have some drinks, make happy plans.
Bye, sweetie.
I just have two more pen pals and then I'm done.
Why so glum?
Hi.
Hi.  I was worried I was early.
Totally understood.  Totally wrong of me to talk shop after the day you've had.  Totally sorry.
I was doing sports at the station. The newspaper ran this untrue story that I was leaving and they got all these tons of protest mail.  So they made me anchor.
'Really a lot appreciate it...'
Can I buy you dinner sometime soon?
I just got back -- I don't know which end is up.
So he was indicted?
I've got another story.
Yeah.  It was an unusual place to be.
I didn't think you'd make it.
Okay.  You didn't like the party, huh?
What?
If I tell you, can you manage not to put it down or tell me why it won't work or is in bad journalistic taste or anything like that?
No.  Are you going to the Correspondents' Dinner on Saturday?
So you like me, huh?
You're not going to take off on me, are you?
Why can't I let go of this woman?
I was half hoping I wouldn't have a good time tonight.  You know why?
Well, when?
Yes.
Good night??!
Maybe I haven't been here long enough.  But, hey, congratulations on the promotion.
You want to come?
Then you should stay here.
I sure know that feeling.  Terrific work today.
Boy, that's nice...I wish we could all deal with each other like this. I'll check it.  Anything I can do for you?
The last time I was with someone we went through this awful mutual disease questionnaire but I guess it beats getting paranoid the next day.  Okay, I'll go first.  I haven't...
Would you like to do me?
Tonight.
Oh it's enough...
I already told you I'm not.
Look -  This pose is all wrong!
Everyone wants to meet the bus boy.
You really like it?
It's a...full length life-size figure!
It's called spontaneity, Leonard. Get with the program.
It's not really that big I got it on kind of a stand...
Like it?  It's a masterpiece.  I've never seen anything like it before... and I hope I never see anything like it again. Walter smiles and looks at his creation -
May I please have another little kiss?
Walter!  Jeez!
Ready?  We've got plenty of time.
Well that was for your sculpture of the girl.  Your nude in the chair.
Walter, I'm sorry...
Jeez, what is your problem all of a sudden?
I'm trying to find a style of my own.  Do you really like them?
Nothing...nothing at all.
No.  Why don't you cover it up Walter...
Would you pose for me for free?
Yeah, can you say plagiarism?
I wonder what his deal is.
Man look at that get up !
What did he say?
I don't have another cat!
Well make a dog, make a parakeet! I'm sure you'll think of something.
Well...why murdered man?
Walter...Walter listen carefully.  I don't want you to make any more statues.  Do you understand? No more statues.
Maxwell!  He's behind all this with all his stupid blowhard poetry!  Listen, you've got to stop right away!  I'm beginning to feel responsible!
Well, w-what did you do?
I tried to contact you by phone but I couldn't...
I'm not looking to pinch you!  I don't care about you, or the girl.  But you want to save your ass, you better start telling me what I want to hear.  Now!
Alaska!  What the heck's wrong with it!
Did you like it Mister Brock?
Hi.
No thanks.  Sounds good though.
What do you get?
You don't have to do anything!
Come on, come on, fork up the scub.
Benny, man, where you been?  You bailed on me, I passed out, man, I almost did a Jimi Hendrix!
I'm fine.
Wheels?
Hi, Buffy.
Have you gained a few pounds?  Maybe it's that outfit...
Maybe.
Hey, baby, how ya doing?  You look beat.
I don't understand.
Didn't you get my message?
You had a car full of stuff.  Were you leaving?
Hey, jeez are you okay?  You need a hand?
I know.  My guidance counselor never mentioned anything about vampires. 'Prison' came up a few times, but nothing about undead.
I didn't expect to see you.
Buffy?  What's wrong?
I been working on some stuff for you.  What'cha doing?
For the dance.
Can't.  History report.  The Normans and the Saxons.
Am I in trouble or something?
You must believe me.  You must come with me while there's still time.
Wait a minute.
Why do you keep saying that?
In a way, yes.  Your fate is inexorably connected to them.
Who we gonna beat?
Who we gonna beat?
And you caught it!  Only the chosen one could have done that.
Toasty.  Were there ever any, like, famous vampires?
Same one.
Fine.
It's natural.  A reaction to their presence, to the... unnaturalness of it.  It's part of how you are able to track them.
You'll get used to it.  I'm more worried about your tactical mistakes.
Buffy...
What do you want?  Encouragement?  'Gosh, Buffy, you're so special, I just want to give you a great big hug, oh I'm just having a warm fuzzy.'
So, basically, I've got the life expectancy of a zit, right?
As for example, what?
Vampires of the world, beware.
We call them zippers.  They're not supposed to be a challenge.
You got a C-plus?  I can't believe I cheated off you.
No THX.
Cassandra's really smart.
So very much.
The mark of the Coven.
But as long as there have been vampire, there has been the Coven; the line of Slayers.  Ones with the strength and the skill to kill them, to find them where they gather and stop the swell of their numbers. One dies, the next is called.
Write that down.
Oh, yes!  Yes!
Buffy was on the uneven parallels -- she was really good; coach said she could have been in the Olympics -- but she was doing a routine, spinning, and the beam broke.
You're kidding.
Oh, my God!  Ouch!  No wonder you quit.
Wit-tay.
Smell of booze much.
What are you talking about?
Like you've got a grip.
Hey.  What should I do if I see Benny?
I want you to wear these on the road trip when you pitch.
What?
Good.  Total exhaustion can be spiritually fabulous.  Let's play catch.
The pingala is the nostril used for throwing a baseball.  And if you discover before a game you're in the wrong nostril, it's easy to switch.
Nuke!  You got things all wrong! There's no relation between sex and baseball.  Ask Crash.
Neither will I.
You didn't get "lured".  Women never get lured.  They're too strong and powerful for that. Now say it--"I didn't get lured and I will take responsibility for my actions".
Five hours.  We both just know.  Do you think I deserve to wear white?
I'm not interested in a woman who's interested in that boy.
See my hips?
Yep.
What'you see in that guy--he's dim, pretty boy.  a young, wild,
Damn.
And he's right!  A ballplayer on a streak has to respect the streak. They don't happen very often.  You know how hard this game is? If you believe you're playing well because you're getting laid or because you're not getting laid or because you wore red silk panties--then you are!  And I still think Thomas Pynchon is full of shit.
I don't imagine there's much I could teach you.
--and as soon as we lose a game, he'll be back in your arms.
Who?
No.
Why not?
Annie---
I got a lotta time to hear your theories and I wanta hear every damn one of 'em...but right now I'm tired and I don't wanta think about baseball and I don't wanta think about Quantum Physics...  I don't wanta think about nothing...  I just wanta be.
Ninety-five miles an hour.
Ninety-three miles an hour.
Ebby's told me a lot about you.
We were worried that Ebby might get involved with the wrong crowd in professional baseball--we're so pleased, he met a Christian woman.
Well--you boys stopped fighting yet?  Are you pals now?  Good.  I love a little macho male bonding-- I think it's sweet even if it's probably latent homosexuality being "re-channeled" but I believe in "re-channeling" so who cares, right?  Shall we go to my place?
No, no, honey...  first the shoes and socks.
Well, he sort of pitches for the Cosmic All-Stars.
We gonna fuck or what?
Try it!  Go ahead.  Call me a cocksucker!
Call me a cocksucker and you're outta here!
Guy hit the shit outta that one, eh?
I'm having a blast.  God, that sucker teed off on it just like he knew I was gonna throw a fastball.
You been in the Majors?
If I get laid, you won't tell Annie?
Party without me.
Hey, I'm cruisin', man--what're you doing out here?!
I love winning, Crash, you hear me?  I love It.  Teach me everything.
It's time you started working on your interviews.
She's getting steamed 'cause I'm still re-channeling my sexual energy--maybe I should cave in and sleep with her once just to calm her down.  What'ya think?
Forget it.
Crash Davis?
I'm too old for this shit.  Why the hell am I back in "A" ball?
And where can I go?
Step outside, pal.
I'd kill ya.
No.  If I screw up, I wanta do it alone.  I'll call.
Ain't he warning up?
We're eight and sixteen.
The organization wants to make a change...now that Nuke's gone they wanta bring up some young catcher...
So what? Everybody out here with cowboy boots is a fuckin' county commissioner or related to a county commissioner. I'm fuckin' sick of it.
What are you talking about?
Hey, I need a room. Need a room.
I was never - I was never your guest at the Tangiers.
You were never my guest?!
You were wandering around.
What do you propose?
All right, look, if he took a break, it would just give everybody some time to maneuver. That's all I'm saying. It's all that I'm saying.
Excuse me.
Fine, fine. How's your family?
Mm-hm.  1862. Okay, good. I'll call you right b-
Oh. Have a good day at school.
I'll take Columbia for twenty.
I don't care. I want to get away from back home for a while. I'm tired of that shit back there.  Look at this place. It's made of money. You know what the best part is? Nobody's gonna know what we're doin'! There's nobody here to see us! Everybody's back home.
But I saw it another. I saw it as untouched. I mean, they had bookies, pimps and drug dealers I could shake down. Who the fuck were they gonna run to?  So, I started getting everybody in line. Best of all, for the first time in my life, I figured out a way not to lose.
Especially at the casino, where he definitely did not work, people got the message.
...Nicky was dreamin' his own kind of Vegas.
No, I didn't know that. But you know what he did?
I'm just tellin' you. Don't say I didn't warn you.
Fuck the FBI! That prick's been dodging me for three weeks. And what is it with you?  All of a sudden, you're tryin' to tell me what to do all the time.
That's all taken out of context. Okay.
...uh, uh, cigarette holder. I'm - I lost control?!
She came to talk to me...
This guy is gonna run to the FBI.
Nicky was questioned in two dozen murders, but they always had to let him go. There were never any witnesses.
Yeah.
I didn't do anything. I mean, I didn't order you or anybody...  I only told Andy Stone that you had a lot of heat on you, and that was a problem.
Oh, I don't know whether you know this or not, but you only have your fuckin' casino because I made that possible!
I'm only on TV because I gotta be able to hang around the casino. You understand that. You know that. Come on.
Your fuckin' ass! You could have had the food and beverage job without goin' on television!  You wanted to go on TV.
You're makin' a big fuckin' spectacle of yourself.
You never - ?
She was afraid to call you.
Yeah? Nicky, I want to talk to that fuckin' bitch.
Mr Rothstein...  I'm Pat Webb.
I think you're way out of line talkin' to me like that. What you're sayin' is libelous, and you're in no position to challenge my expertise. I went way out of my way to be very helpful and courteous to that kid. He's weak, he's incompetent. He jeopardizes the whole place. There's not much more I can do for him.
Well, that's why they paid so well.
Well, it's a little too early. I'd say Thursday would be good. I'll know by then. Is that all right?
No, Ace.
Never mind the 'sir'. Never mind the 'sir'.
Well, sir, I was just...
To Abraham Lincoln.
What is it?
Now, he's really pissed.
No, just - just give him, give him ten. That's it. Ten.  I'll be right down.
I'm going to go powder my nose. 
Any change?
She took care of the dealers...
Hey, Mitch.
Within no time, everything was set in place. We got rid of the freelance scamsters. The per was way up.  The gods were happy, or as happy as the gods can ever be.  And I, I decided to complicate my life. For a guy who likes sure things, I was about to bet the rest of my life on a real longshot.
What, are you trying to handicap me?
I care about you, a - But I just don't have those kind of feelings for you. I'm sorry. I'm not in love with you.
If it doesn't work out. You know, if it doesn't play out, then what happens to me?
I'm okay. I just -  You just have to understand. I've been with Lester since I was a kid. I just wanted to say goodbye. I - I just...  I don't... I think I have a right to do that. Okay?
Right?
It's nice isn't it?
But as much as they loved her...
What do you need?
Twenty-five thousand? For yourself?
Yeah.
I'm aware of that. We don't have to turn this into a big deal.  Okay? We don't have to have a fight. It was important to me. But forget it. Just something I wanted to do for myself.
If not for me, at least for Amy.
You understand? Your drinking's gettin' way out of hand. I'm gonna get you into a program. They got plenty of good ones.
No, you don't.
How could you say that?  You're a beautiful woman. You're destroying yourself. You don't need that stuff. You don't need that fuckin' leech livin' off you. I know you better than you know yourself. You're a tiger, you're stronger than I am. And when you set your mind on doing something, you do it better than anybody.  You can do it.  You can do it.
We had a deal. Remember that?  He said if it didn't work out between us, that I could get my things and I could leave.
Hi, it's me.  Just who you wanted to talk to, right?
...uh-uh-uh - I'm not gonna ask you where you are, just please, put Amy on a plane. Just put her on right away, any plane to get her here right away...
What I mean is, you think if, uh, do you think if I came back... do you think you could forgive me?
I gotta tell ya...
He wanted a watch, too.
Plus, at the most, three suits, a thousand apiece. That still leaves what?  Around ten thousand?
Would you knock it off, Sam?
Stop! You aren't getting rid of me with one fuckin' suitcase!
What did Jennifer have?
She had the same.
Just wait there for me!
Don't thank me, just do it. You're the Slots Manager. I shouldn't have to tell you this.
I'll regret it even more if I keep you on.
Can you do it with your left hand?
Look what they did to my hand, man!
Excuse me.
Mm.
You gotta go back out there.
Well, I keep layin' out my own fuckin' dough for these trips and nothin' ever comes back. I mean, what hell's goin' on? What are we doin' over here?
No, I don't want one.  Hey, Mr Clark, how you doin'?
Yeah.  I think I want my money back.
Hey!
You know who you're fuckin' with?! Huh? Do you?!
Now move along.
Leave me alone!
Nicky, I did -
I did - I didn't -
I had my kid brother, Dominick, run it for me.
Yeah. Everybody's talkin' about it. They're makin' a big deal out of it.
What're you gonna do?
Frankie... the little guy, he wouldn't be fuckin' the Jew's wife, would he? Because if he is... it's a problem.
So, I lied... even though I knew that by lyin' to Gaggi, I could wind up gettin' killed too.
Hey, Nick. Vien acca. [Italian- American slang for 'Come here']
Keep a good eye on him. He's makin' a lot of money for us. And he's gonna continue makin' a lot of money for us, so keep a good eye on him.
Yeah.
Oh, you did? I didn't know that.
Yeah. He's just a friend of mine I was trying to help, so... so what?
So, he put aside some jewelry for me. A lot of jewelry.
Mm, you want to steal it? 
I'm told it's worth about a million dollars, maybe more. 
Look, I'll try to find out what the hell's goin' on. When I see him I'll talk to him.
Oh, come on.
You're a beautiful girl. You don't want to ruin your looks. I've seen a lot of girls get shot to hell from this stuff.
You just relax. Nobody's killin' anybody, do you hear?
Yeah. 'Cause, you know,  He's never gonna give me my jewelry.
I did what you told me to.
He hates my fuckin' guts.
I'm not and he scares the shit out of me. I never know what he's gonna do.
Me? I said... nothin'. I said, I said, 'No, no, no.' Everything he said, I just kept sayin' no.
I'm not gonna kill him. Shut the fuck up. What, do you know what you're talkin' about? I'm not killing anyb-
Don't give me that shit. I want my money.
Get lost?
Promise?
What do you think we're gonna do? He's probably got guys outside the fuckin' house!
Just knock it off! Would you two knock it off? Get in the car.
Give all the guys in your crew a piece of that?
Hey. This is Shelly.
I do all the work. Somebody don't like it, fuck him.
I know. I know.
Yeah, just let me know. But you gotta be ready. You know what I'm talkin' about?
Take it easy!
How you doin'?
You're a little confused?
I'm sorry, Nicky. I didn't mean anything by it.
No, I want to have this marked, Mr. -
Denying?
Do I hear a motion seconded?
You know - You know - You know what they're doin' to me?
You'll get a heart attack like that.
...everything's comin' out of my pocket. I gotta pay for all these trips back and forth, back and forth.
Oh Man, not the sewer, I just had this cape cleaned...
Have we reached the epi-center?
Cactus, I can't believe you just said all that...
He likes you. Kincaid and I have always had similar tastes...
Hmm. Not bad.
Quite a pair we make. Thank you, Jeff.
In many ways, that obnoxious creep Cactus was the worst one of all. He got off on giving out pain...
Women, huh?
I've been looking for you.
Oh Honey, it's so much better when we do it without the helmet.
I've been thinking. I've been thinking about us. I'm sorry I've been so hard no you these past couple days. I realize now it's because you're the only woman who ever understood me and I couldn't handle it!  I've never revealed myself to anyone the way I have to you. Let's blow this town together.  We'll run a bed-and-breakfast in Vermont by day, and by night, we'll dress up and kill anything that...
The shopkeeper on 13th street won't drop the lawsuit--He still claims one of the lasers we fired at the Jenkins gang burned down his store..
"Dat's gotta hurt!"
Cactus, sometimes you don't deserve to wear our logo.
Oh, I wish they wouldn't feed him like that.
The Tranquilizer Tranquility will hold for about an hour..where is she? These women are out here on a lark-- Ladies Night at a discotheque.  It's not in their blood the way it is for Catwoman...Where is she?
You think so?...Selina?
Ah, the good guys always triumph in the end. It's what allows our children to sleep at night.
The Mission is happening tonight..It's up to you to...to save the City...
You Housewives have no idea what we go through!
Hey, Captain God!
Yes, you shouted the words "Captain God" at me for no reason...
Oh, do you turn around every time somebody just shouts at you?
I give up. I give up.--I can't figure you out. Not gonna try.
Maybe.
Mom?  Oh Mom, I messed up...
They're going to attack Frank's Fun Palace!
You seem sad, Spooky.
What are you doing on Theo's line?
Say something ...
I know where it is.  Give me that phone back.
He's right, Theo.  She might not be around to back up your story. You could end up in the middle of this.
First off, this Mr. Chow Yen doesn't speak a lot of English. The girl with him will interpret. There will be a third person to accompany you into the men's room where you can take count.  I hope you know Krugerands better than they know a <u>Hockney</u>.
Okay, okay, Lenore, calm down. Either let me call the school or better yet, the F.B.I.
Don't fuck around.  Pop a cap in him.
I'm still in my cab -- jammed up in traffic.  Are you there yet?
I've been trying to get someone -- anyone.  For hours ...
The cops could trace this call back to you.
Then they took the Mercedes away -- with his body in it.
Why isn't anyone answering me?
Hello?  It's just me and you again.
What about the others?
I kind of dropped them off.  They were getting on my nerves.
How much time do you have left on it?
There are cables overhead.  Hang on.  It'll clear up.
No.
She's gone --
What bank?
What do you mean?
What's going on?
Why tell me this?
I had a little encounter at the bank and our Mr. Transplant ended up under the wheels of a Chevy.
Are you okay?
That's coming off.  How about the girl?
They tortured us.  And you're going to let them have all that money?
They put their hands all over me.
Whose money is this?
The video cameras will put you with him in the bank, and I'll bet there were enough witnesses.
They always pick Rachel up early on Thursday.
I got what I fucking deserved.  I had it all.  I could've kept going!
There's no way out for you.  You have to deal with us.
Only in the leg or the thigh. You'd live but you just wouldn't wear shorts.
Do you think they'll walk away?
They'll have units blocking us up ahead.
What's happening?
They did some great job of reforming you.
Who'd ever think, to look at you?
Sooner or later you'll learn to trust me.
The cop in the trunk -- he could still be alive.
He might've heard everything we said in the car.
Maybe your friends already accomplished that chore for us.
Know what else is in here?
Who is this?
Oh God -- Oh no -- Help me -- Don't let me -- Die.
I'm self employed.  What kind of cut did the hairy one have?
Twenty percent.
She's somewhat damaged in the shipping.  But nothing makeup won't cover.
Take my number.  When you see me -- call me and I'll walk you through the exchange.  It's 308-9962 -- Repeat it back.
I'm three quarters of the way up the lot behind the concession stand.
I'm opening the side door.  She'll step out.  But before she gets in your vehicle I want to see the first installment put down in plain view.  If it isn't there I'm shooting her in the back.
If you're looking for a quickie all you've got to do is ask.
And I end up in a fucking neck brace for life!
I just strolled out of the emergency room while they were admitting Rodriego.
Only you <u>don't</u> have a flat.
Was I picking on you?  How come you pulled in back of this fruitstand?
Let me talk to the lady again.
If you've already killed her that's fine.  I'll keep the bonds and the cash.  We got nothing to discuss.
Let's have your name and address. The government will want to send you a letter of commendation.
Scottish?
See that, Col?
Just cut his hair, you know.
That's what he said. Jimmy.
He's still looking, Col.
Stop it, Dil --
Saw it, Dil.
It's not Pat. It's Jim.
If I was her I'd consider that an insult.
Guy I work with.
No.
You old-fashioned?
What's that about?
They're jealous.
That Dave?
Someone out there.
As different as it's possible to be.
What would he think?
Depends what it is.
Why?
Even now.
Got your note. So let's kiss and make up, hon.
Do you care, Jimmy?
You think that's wise?
Do they know?
Know what, honey?
Probably.
You can always pretend.
Okay. Be a good girl and go inside.
Dil, this is Jude.
Kind of.
You're no good at this, Jimmy.
I got the order to shoot him. Before I could do it he ran. Ran into a tank and died.
No.
I suppose I tried.
Stop it, Dil --
Let me go for fuck's sake, Dil -- or they'll be here
Love me.
Whatever you say, Dil.
It's my name, Dil --
I'm sorry, darling. I keep forgetting the leap year. What am I supposed to call you then, Jimmy?
Please, Dil --
Put that thing back on him, Fergus.
I heard.
Maguire and me got out by the skin of our teeth. No thanks to you.... What you think of the hair?
But you know what the thing is, Fergus?
You vanished quite effectively. Became Mister Nobody. And you've no idea how useful that could be.
Och, you do, Fergie.
Perfect.
Fergus, I think you don't trust me.
Who's the old geezer?
I take pride in my work.
You sure about that?
I understand.
And who is she?
Aye, I do, Peter.
So what do you think that is, Hennessy?
Thank God for that.
Good. So what do you think?
This is a farce, man.
Please, man, I'm suffocating in here.
No?
No. It's the truth.
I'm not a gambling man.
Not in your nature.
What the fuck do you know about my people?
She'd be anyone's type.
What the fuck am I doing here.
I got sent.
That game where a bunch of paddies whack sticks at each other?
Shut up, would you?
It's as simple as that?
I didn't.
See if she's all right.
What?
What if I did?
It was fun while it lasted.
You're crazy --
-- there has to be a darn good reason for living the way you do. I want to know what it is.
It's simple. I like what I do -- I enjoy doing it. There aren't many men who love their work as much as I do. Look around some time.
Adam!
I think we were wrong about Tex having the money.
Think, Reggie, you've got to think -- it may be what we're looking for.
There is? Well, I can't say I think very much of a silly law like that. Think, Reggie -- please think -- what was written in Charles' notebook?
Can I really believe you this time, Adam?
Have some, please. I've got...  ...liverwurst -- liverwurst -- chicken and -- liverwurst.
You mean spies and things like that?
What's all this got to do with me, Mr. Bartholomew?
His -- real -- ?
Aren't they?  Now look at this one, Mrs. Voss, and --
Please, do what we ask, Mrs. Lampert -- it's your only chance.
But it's Charles's money, not theirs.
Where are you now -- can you meet me? Do you know Les Halles?
Dyle, or whatever his name is.
Barely, yes.
Mrs. Lampert, I really hadn't planned on spending the entire night here.
Please go on, Mr. Bartholomew -- what happened then?
We're not allowed to tell. May I have the stamps, please?
-- recommending that all Embassy offices be locked during the lunch hour.
Brian.
Do I knock or something?
I'll give you a chance, Dyle -- which is more than you'd give me. Where's the money?
Ha ha. You could at least tell me what your first name is these days.
You can't.
I hope it turns out you're a Whitefoot, Alex -- I could be very happy hanging around the tepee.
But I'm not through complaining yet.
They've got Jean-Louis!
Tuesday.
Because I really suspect Gideon -- and it is always the person you don't suspect.
Women. You know, I can't help feeling rather sorry for Scobie.  Wouldn't it be nice if we were like that?
What -- like Scobie?
Don't worry, I'm not going to hit you.
Why don't you shut up!
I don't believe it.
The man's the same, even if the name isn't.
A two-penny Mauritius -- issued in 1856. Not so rare as the others -- $30,000 perhaps.
I suggest you get about your business -- nothing soothes Herman like success.
What do you mean, no?
Oh. Swiss. His profession?
He was a wealthy man?
I don't know. I suppose so.
Besides yourself, who is his nearest relation?
I don't know. Perhaps he met somebody.
I don't understand.
But he is gone.
I'm Regina Lampert.
Yes, I am -- I'm compulsive about it -- dishonesty infuriates me. Like when you go into a drugstore.
I'm not sure I --
Oh. Well, wasn't it Shakespeare who said: "When strangers do meet they should erelong see one another again"?
Shakespeare never said that.
Charles is.
How did you find out?
It's in all the afternoon papers. I'm very sorry.
I rang the bell but I don't think it's working.
Try and get my old job back at UNESCO, I suppose.
Something like that. But I'm sorry it ended like this -- tossed off a train like a sack of third-class mail.
He said if I told anybody it could prove fatal for them as well as me.
That's what I'm not supposed to say.
I think I sprained my pride.  Where'd he go?
There was no trace of him. All right, Reggie -- suppose you tell me what this is all about.
Please help me, Peter -- you're the only one I can trust.
Usually it's because they want something -- and they're afraid the truth won't get it for them.
Yes -- that's right.
Can you give me one good reason why I should?
He's the only husband I've got. I tried to make it work, I really have -- but --
With a rich husband and this year's clothes you will not find it difficult to make some new friends.
What is it about?
Those stamps -- they're worth a fortune!
Don't be un-neighborly-like, Herman -- don't forget he done us a little ol' favor.
He feels terrible about those things he said to you in school.
If I'm so all-used-up Ben, why do you try to hook me up non-stop?
Not my imports.
The kids adore him. They confide in him. His patchouli reeking rear might know if Stacy and Rod were really virgins. Why didn't you ask Jody that?
You tell these people someone is out there killing virgins and we're going to have a goddamn fuckfest on our hands.
You said that two weeks ago.
A little.
It was a she.
Should we close down any eruption?
Are you sure?
Well?
This will relax her.
Hello?
I knew Lisa Sherman long ago. It's extremely important that I get inside and try to verify that it's the same woman who lived here.
Your brother told us.
You're not?
Then you should go.
Yes.
You're the killed.
Please! You wouldn't kill your sister, would you?
I don't watch him eat everyday.
No! That's his table.
You get to be a little Chelsea Clinton. Everyone wants to meet you. Party with you. Have sex with you.
I promised I'd go right home after school.
Sandy, you have to chill out, at least two-thirds of the kids in our class are still virgins. He can't butcher all of us.
Unless he makes a move during seventh period.
Didn't you have something a little more romantic in mind for your first time?
I kind of like the idea that we can all lose it together, on the same night. It'll be a lot less scary. You have to go.
Are you O.K.?
I did.
I'm not using him as an excuse.
I do not.
Yeah. Who is she?
Wait.
You didn't believe her?
No, I believed her. She was in pretty bad shape. Inside and out. But the boys were never formally charged.
I don't know. We just did. I guess I was kind of scared going against the gain. Against the whole town.
Two men left town right after it happened.
Hi Mark, Cindy, Ben.
Now don't be nervous.
Stacy?

...shit.
It's a damn postal truck!
Hey, you and I are seein' eye to eye on a whole range of issues this mornin'. 
Sorry, man.  He's dead.

I'll rent the truck from you.  You can stay here, you can go.  Whatever you want.
Yeah, to keep him off my ass.
Are you kiddin'?
...-er.
Look...I kinda borrowed the truck from Andy.

Hey.


I was thankin' you, asshole!
...reconsider that statement there, Night Shift.  You're psy-...
I did not steal the truck.
Well, then, that means it's call...
Holy shit...
...man!
 Okay.
 I should've had that dog bite me.  I would've gotten rabies! Could've went to the hospital, had a pretty nurse!
Get over!  Get over!
I know the likeli-...
...Pete.  Come on.
Come on.
What are you talkin' about?!  I'm the one drivin'!
Ho, ho...
 Oh...
 ...shit!
 

No.  Shit.

Yeah...

...you're dealin' with!
I'm a dangerous man!
Oh, no!
...did you?
You're fucked, man.
...stole the truck.
I deserve a lot more than that truck! Ten years, ten years I busted my ass for that fat rat bastard.
Robert Del Rio?
Yeah, Robert Del Rio.
...hospital.
Hey, hey, hey.
 Come on!
Yeah.
Okay.  All right, man.  Okay.
...to him. 
Go!

Stop.
Aw, shit.  Would you be more care-...
...-ful?!
Forty-nine point four.
Mason.

Hold this. 
Hang on, hang on.

Excuse me.  I got a bullet in my leg.
Who put the big hurt on...
...and-and-and truckless in the service of my country...
Us.  Owes us.
 Yeah.
That's bullshit.
Yeah.
...within five minutes.
 Just give me Elvis and I'll make sure you have enough money for a dozen ice cream trucks.
Your move.  Okay, Vaughn, you drive.
Vaughn.
...Arlo, and you screwed me for it. Now, where's my goddamn truck?
...help you?
...take my sorry old truck.
What?  Say again...
Thank you.
Your country and a lot of innocent people in it...
In order to protect those secrets, I am authorized to fine you, imprison you...
...to be off the island tonight.
And I changed the schedule.
...I wish they would've let me say something...
...about--
Is this stool taken?
...always done, Richard?
Do you think I haven't seen the bodies of those...
Went away? 

Well, Lieutenant Vitelli.
I checked your release date.  I never liked coincidences.
Yeah, I had a small problem with members of our side murdering civil-...
Get 'em on line, then stall.  Long can't have gotten far.

Dutiful citizens, you have something which I have waited years for.

Carl, establish contact with that deputy we met earlier.  He'll be more useful now.
It's clean.
Shit.
I'm Colonel Brynner, U.S. Special Operations Com-...
 But...
Well, then, how about a cup of coffee, Darlene?
...dangerous.
...deer.
...the river.

 


...-time,  remember?
Story of my life.  Well, one thing you won't lose is that friend of yours back there, I'll tell you that.
His I know.  Yours I don't have a clue.  But if it wasn't for you, I think he'd have drifted right on through this town.

You got thirty minutes.
Sir, we can't just let him get away with this!
That little geek is my...
It must've happened right after we left.
Uh-huh.

My secret?
 No, that's not possible, Mason.  The trout... 
Tie a fly...
Shit!  Oh, shit. 
The compound has to be kept cold...
 The only one who understands what this me-...
Well,  Costello's finished with the stability profile, but Abbott is still chewing on the load file.
Dr.  Long!
We've got the real thing!
You find yourself wearing a...
Got that?
...selling this young man beer Wednesday night.
I don't sell beer to minors.  I take that kinda thing...
...to talk, son.
Get in 

Do it now.
Then these are all new owners?
That's right.
If that's what it says.
I said horseshit.  Horseshit.
Wouldn't it be useful to talk to her?
Just find the girl, Mr. Gittes. I think she is frightened and I happen to know Hollis was fond of her. I'd like to help her if I can.
Hollis Mulwray made this city and he made me a fortune... We were a lot closer than Evelyn realized.
If you want to hire me, I still have to know what you and Mulwray were arguing about.
An obituary column... can you read in this light?
What does this mean?
How do you do that?
How much are you worth?
I have no idea. How much do you want?
The future, Mr. Gittes. The future. Now where's the girl?... I want the only daughter I have left... as you found out, Evelyn was lost to me a long time ago.
At your daughter's house. How soon can you get here?
Sure, as soon as we eat.
Plus what I owe you?
Why?
That's just lovely.
Is it? I forget. I don't call myself that often.
I heard it was an accident.
She lives in Pedro. I'll write it down for you.
Gee, Lou, I'm doing the best I can.
Let her go. She didn't kill anybody.
I'm sorry, Mrs. Mulwray.
Lou, she will kill you. Let her go for now. You don't know.
You and your husband never discussed her?
But I thought you'd hired a private investigator.
A private investigator?
I should talk this over with your husband.
Why?... What on earth for?  Look, Hollis seems to think you're an innocent man.
No, Just riding bareback, that's all. Anyway, you might try the Oak Pass or Stone Canyon Reservoirs. Sometimes at lunch Hollis takes walks around them. Otherwise he'll be home by 6:30.
I'll stop by.
...Just a minute...
Stop it. The money's fine. It's generous but you've shortchanged me on the story.
It wasn't much of a lie.
Did he know?
Your father is Julian Cross, isn't he?
What are you thinking?
The Valley?
Everything you can see, everything around us. I was at the Hall of Records today.  That bother you?
Know him?
I'll stay.
Maid's night off?
I gave everybody the night off.
Well, I'm only judging on the basis of one afternoon and an evening, but if that's how you go about your work, I'd say you're lucky to get through a whole day.
Hold still. Why?
It has to do with my father.
What did he say?  What did he say?
Do? To who?
That's what your father said. You're telling me he's in back of this whole thing?
It's either that or you drive to the police yourself.
J. J. Gittes for Lieutenant Escobar
What are you saying?
Where can we go?
Sophie.
Where'd he go yesterday?
Oh yes we have... are you alone, Mr. Gittes?
Shut the fuck up!  ...Yes I remember nothing, Miss Sessions, just going over a detail or two with my associates... you were saying?
A Miss Sessions calling.
Naturally, I want the best for him, money is no object.
There's just one question.
That's exactly what we wanted to hear.
Yeah, must be especially tough to take over under these circumstances.
Only when you breathe... don't tell me you're still working for Mrs. Mulwray?
Well, look at it this way, Mr. Yelburton.  Mulwray didn't want to build a dam and he had a reputation that was hard to get around, so. you decided to ruin it. Then he found out that you were dumping water every night. Then he was drowned.
Do you know me?
Well... I think I... I would've remembered.
It's bone dry, Morty.
It's not completely dry.
Can't we talk about this alone, Mr. Gittes?
Mr. Yelburton will be busy for some time.
Yes. No.
No, no. She said not to call, her husband might answer.
Yeah?
I'm going to see a man called Julian Cross. Ever heard of him?
That right?... She used to be some looker.
She ran away?
Why'd she run away?
I told my mother you weren't the one who gave me the films. That it wasn't your fault. But I thought you said the film could catch fire just to scare me. Now that I know, I won't steal any more from you. That's all I wanted to say. I'm going. 
Because I'm an idiot. How many other guys in town know how to be a projectionist? None! Only a jerk like me could do it. Besides I wasn't lucky. When I was a kid there was the war! When I grew up, another war! Now it's all different. Times have changed. And you want to be a dope like me? Huh? Answer me!
You understand which side the gelatin's on?
It's got to be sent to another town. And if we don't the owner of that movie house gets pissed off.
Any room for me in this Cinema Paradiso? 
Don't do that...Sooner or later you'll be left empty-handed.
Chaplin's Modern Times! Right, Toto?
Eh! Love...what a mystery!  I understand you, Toto...The ones with blue eyes are the most beautiful. Whatever you do, you can't make friends with them.  Eh, there's nothing to be done about it! The heavier a man is, the deeper his footprints. And if he's in love, he suffers, because he knows he's up a one-way street. Because love is a meaningless thing when a man gets it into his head to do what he wants... 
You see, it s like I say. You always have an answer for everything.
Just so, Alfredo. There isn't any. And if you buy a television set, you can watch it at home, without any fuss...
I'm here! Take it easy! Take it easy!  Sit down, sit down...  Did she come?
Listen to this one...The commander says to the sergeant: 'You remember that windmill that used to be there?' 'Yes, sir, I remember the mill's gone but the wind's still there!'  You remember the story of the soldier and the princess? 
Hi. Why are you running?
For what?
He won't be convinced, Salvatore. He has other plans for me.
My husband...you know him.
Then where's the money?
Ready for dinner, Brad?
I can't take shorthand, Mr. Kane -
Gentlemen of the "Enquirer"!  This has, I think, been a fitting welcome to those distinguished journalists -  Mr. Reilly in particular - who are the latest additions to our ranks. It will make them happy to learn that the "Enquirer's" circulation this morning passed the two hundred thousand mark.
Yes.  I thought it was a good idea. We've covered it from the news end, of course.
And the social.  How about the music notice?  You got that in?
-  We thought maybe, if we can find out what he meant by that last word - as he was dying -
You know why?  She was so -
I'm going back there.
Mr. Bernstein, am I a stuffed shirt? Am I a horse-faced hypocrite?  Am I a New England school-marm?
Where is it - where's my notice? I've got to finish it!
There is no news big enough.
It's not our function to report the gossip of housewives.  If we were interested in that kind of thing, Mr. Kane, we could fill the paper twice over daily -
Mr. Kane, this is a surprise!
Yes - Mr. Kane.
There's a call I want you to make with me, Charles.
Get out, both of you!
Toothache.
You're no Venus de Milo.
If you want to come in and wash your face -  I can get you some hot water to get that dirt off your trousers -
Where's the soap?
On the chiffonier.  Here.
Excuse me, Mr. Kane.  I know this takes a lot of nerve, but - who are you?  I mean - I'm pretty ignorant, I guess you caught on to that -
Oh, me -
Is that what you want to do?
I want to be a singer.  I mean, I didn't.  Mother did for me.
Oh, you wouldn't want to hear me sing.
Oh, no, that's all gone.
You always said you wanted to live in a palace.
Susan, I really think -
I understand that you have political ambitions.  Unfortunately, you seem incapable of allowing any other opinion but your own -
Your mother won't be going right away, Charles -
Close the door, Raymond.
It's a wall you bought in China, Mr. Kane.
He was dead...  That's a poem.  Do you know what it means?
You don't want to be a war correspondent - how about being a dramatic critic?
You start tomorrow night.  Richard Carl in "The Spring Chicken."  I'll get us some girls.  You get tickets.  A drama critic gets them free, you know.  Rector's at seven?
Yes?
What do you mean by that?
Charlie!
What lesson?  Not to expose fraud when I see it?  Not to fight for the right of the people to own their own property?  Run it the way I said, Reilly - "This afternoon a great man was assassinated -"
I'm drunk.
I'll tell you what I'll do, Brad - I'll get drunk, too - maybe that'll help.
Emily's going south next week with the child.  As far as anybody's to know, it's a holiday.  When they get back -
Sure I am.  She wants full custody of the child no matter what happens. If you won't agree to that, she'll apply for a divorce regardless of the President's wishes.  I can't tell her she's wrong, because she isn't wrong -
The personal note is all there is to it.  It's all there ever is to it.  It's all there every is to anything!  Stupidity in our government, complacency and self-satisfaction and unwillingness to believe that anything done by a certain class of people can be wrong - you can't fight those things impersonally. They're not impersonal crimes against people.  They're being done by actual persons - with actual names and positions and - the right of the American people to own their own country is not an academic issue, Brad, that you debate - and then the judges retire to return a verdict and the winners give a dinner for the losers.
You talk about the people of the United States as though they belonged to you.  When you find out they don't think they are, you'll lose interest.  You talk about giving them their rights as though you could make a present of liberty. Remember the working man?  You used to defend him quite a good deal. Well, he's turning into something called organized labor and you don't like that at all.  And listen, when your precious underprivileged really get together - that's going to add up to something bigger than - than your privilege and then I don't know what you'll do - sail away to a desert island, probably, and lord it over the monkeys.
I know you will.
Yes.
It's going to be done exactly the way I've told Mr. Thatcher -
Was he in love?
Charles, my name is Mr. Thatcher -
Ask the question anyway, Thompson! Build the picture around the question, even if you can't answer it.
She's just not talking to anybody from the newspapers, Mr. Thompson.
You're shittin' me.
Maybe you should take that coffee outside.
Now he's going to launch into his rap about how he's just doing his job; following orders.  Friends, let me tell you about another bunch of hate mongers that were just following orders: they were called Nazis, and they practically wiped a nation of people from the Earth... just like cigarettes are doing now! Cigarette smoking is the new Holocaust, and those that partake in the practice of smoking or sell the wares that promote it are the Nazis of the nineties! He doesn't care how many people die from it! He smiles as you pay for your cancer sticks and says, "Have a nice day."
Like I'm responsible for all the smokers!
I take it she likes the guy.
Can I watch?
Can I join in?
You're very protective of him, Randal. You always have been.
Am I missing something here?
I went back there, and Dante was already waiting for me.
I was here the whole time.
What, it's worse? You're pregnant with an Asian design major's child?
I'm not pregnant.
The story goes like this: He proposed, and I told him I had to think about it, and he insisted I wear the ring anyway. Then my mother told the paper we were engaged.
Wreck is a harsh term. Disturbed is more like it. Mildly disturbed even.
The last thing I needed was for you to think I was hiding something from you.
You work in a market, all right.
The key word here is talk, Dante. I think the idea, the conception of us dating is more idyllic than what actually happens when we date.
I can already tell this isn't going to work.
We didn't just have sex in the bathroom?
Nobody. It was closed.
If you can just wait a few more minutes.
Like you're better!
This doesn't even have Burt Reynolds in it.
I've got a responsibility here. I can't let everybody grab free drinks.
Did you tell Veronica?
I'm going to offer you some advice, my friend: let the past be the past. Forget Caitlin Bree. You've been with Veronica for how long now?
Chick only made you nuts. She cheated on you how many times?
That girl was vile to you.
They are. When she calls me now, she's a different person-she's frightened and vulnerable. She's about to finish college and enter the real world. That's got to be scary for anyone.
No, no, I'm listening. She's leaving college, and...?
...and she's looking to me for support. And I think that this is leading our relationship to a new level.
Right, the Emperor. Now the Emperor is kind of a spiritual figure, yes?
It would stand to reason, yes.
Luke blew it up. Give credit where it's due.
Something just never sat right with me the second time they destroyed it. I could never put my finger on it-something just wasn't right.
And the second time around...?
Each egg has to be perfect.
The quest isn't going well?
Did you ever notice all the prices end in nine? Damn, that's eerie.
What's a jizz-mopper?
Nudie booth. You've never been in a nudie booth?
It's not really anyone per se, it's more of separate groupings.
Because my ex-girlfriend is getting married.
I heard you apologize. Why? You have every right in the world to be mad.
Don't yell at me, pal.
I've gotta tell you, my friend: this is one of the ballsiest moves I've ever been privy to. I never would have thought you capable of such blatant disregard of store policy.
Design major.
One ball!! They come all the way here... I close the damn store... for one ball!
After an exhausting game like that I can believe it.
You know what Sanford told me? 
I haven't seen her in almost two years.
Number six.
True, but do you know how many people are going to be there? All of our old classmates, to say the least.
If you go, I go.
An embolism in a pool.
An embarrassing way to die.
I could never reach.
What, your dick?
I can't help it. At least when we were playing hockey outside, I could see if anyone wanted to go in.
Does anyone ever knock over a casket on purpose?
So the casket fell over! Big deal!
Please, get the hell out of here.
Hermaphroditic porn. Starlets with both organs. You should see the box: Beautiful women with dicks that put mine to shame.
Living proof.
Then how come you got the fine?
You're lying.
You want me to bring the VCR over here so we can watch this?
All right, but you're missing out. Chicks with dicks.
Am I right or what?
My mother told me once that when I as three, my potty lid was closed, and instead of lifting it, I chose to shit my pants.
I thought I was doing you a favor.
Like ten after.
I threw out the stuff that got broken. The floor looks clean.
You remember Alyssa Jones? She hung out with...
I'm her sister.
What are you talking about? There's no fat on this body.
What? When? When did all this shit happen?
But I didn't sell cigarettes to any kids! Hey!
Yeah, you cock-smoking clerk.
You sell to people that can't stay away from an addiction.
So why do you sell it for so much more? I'll tell you why-because people come here and they're like "A dollar eighty for soda? I should get it at Food City. But I don't feel like driving there. I'll just buy it here so I don't have to drive up there." That's exploiting a weakness, too, isn't it?
I've had girlfriends, but all they wanted from me was weed and shit.  Shit, my grandma used to say, "Which is better: a good plate with nothing on it..." No, wait. I fucked up. She said "What's a good-looking plate with nothing on it?"
I'm sure he wasn't sleeping.
No; he was probably just resting his eyes.
You know the insides of those are filled with stuff that gives you cancer.
Yeah, but...
The porno mags?
All I'm saying is that if you're unhappy you should leave.
I don't know-like two-thirty, three.
She called you, didn't she?
You were making a generalization about "broads!"
How many what?
Twelve.
They put up the least amount of struggle.
After dropping a bombshell like that, you owe me. Big.
What do you mean?
He requested this?
Why do you say that?
How many?
Something like thirty-six.
I'm going to class.
A few?
He still hasn't shown up. Why aren't you in class?
And he said most of them are college guys, I've never met or seen.
You couldn't get these shutters open?
Would you let me explain...
You don't know what you want, but I'm not going to sit here anymore holding your hand until you figure it out! I've encouraged you to get out of this fucking dump and go back to school, to take charge of your life and find direction. I even transferred so maybe you would be more inclined to go back to college if I was with you. Everyone said it was a stupid move, but I didn't care because I loved you and wanted to see you pull yourself out of this senseless funk you've been in since that whore dumped you, oh so many years ago. And now you want to go back to her so she can fuck you over some more?
They oughta put some kind of warning on these cans, like they do with cigarettes.
Were you working here at about four o'clock?
Yeah, but I didn't sell cigarettes to any kids!
What part of Russia?
Come on, man, "Berserker!"
I don't know. I can't really tell from here.
It's probably from being around all this food every day.
I only pointed out that you weren't paying any attention to what I was saying.
You hope what feels good?
Yo, I don't have that kind of cash.
You're gonna be at John K's party?
The only place I don't bring my drugs is church. And that ain't till Sunday morning.
I'm not sad.
No, I'm more furious. I'm pissed off. I feel like he's been killing time while he tries to grow the balls to tell me how he really feels, and then he can't even do it!  He has his friend do it for him!
After all that I've done for that fuck! And he wants to be with that slut? Fine! He can have his slut!
I just talked to her on Monday. We still hang out on weekends.
Ready to die quiet-like, asshole.
Tucker?
No, stay off the line!  You'll break her loose!
You're gone now!  I don't climb with people I can't trust.  Why'd you come up, to prove something?
I'm here for the same reason you are, so let's do it.
Well you were wrong! It was your weight on the line that did it--
Look, it was a bad time for everybody.
No, buddy, it was you who dropped it!
Thanks for staying around when you didn't have to.
Take the gun.
Please, can I think about this for a minute...Okay, I'm sorry, it's fine.  What do you want me to do?
Use your other hand!  Grab it!
Oh, my God!  I can't recognize the face, but the butt does look vaguely familiar. 
Why can't you believe that you did everything you could?
I can't blame anything on Hal. It was me.  I play it back in my mind everyday.
Where?
And I can't leave.
Thank God you didn't leave.  We just got a Mayday.  Seven climbers stranded off Comb Bluff. The weather's pouring in fast and Hal's gone up alone.
What if he can't?
Gabe!?
You got to go back now!
For the same reason you did, to help.
They've got to find shelter soon, and so do we.  How are you holding up?
Call me sentimental.
It was great.
I've gone this far, and right now I think I'm in better shape than you.
Can you see light?
What?
Never
My heart can't take much more of this.  Look, if we climb down from here, it'll take two hours to get back to the station.
Fine, it shouldn't bother your conscience.
The "old mouth to mouth" resuscitation routine.
Your mouth's writing a check your ass can't cash, but if ya wanna buy some life, bring me the money.
What the fuck you mean you burned it?
What's he doing?
Mr. Travers is not the athletic type, he needs something more direct.
You son of a bitch!  You said you wouldn't kill him!
Go after her.
Got to be Comb Bluff.
What the hell are you doing--
Don't use my name!
We've got a full crew, but we can squeeze one more, right.
I've been cured.
I just don't get this all. It was them that went for me, brothers. You're not on their side and can't be. You can't be Dim. It was someone we fillied with back in the old days... Trying to get his own malenky bit of revenge after all this time. You remember, Dim?
No, my health doesn't allow it.
Phoned some friends, sir?
Help you.
Excuse me, missus, can you please help? There's been a terrible accident. Can I please use your telephone for an ambulance?
I'm frightfully sorry. There is a telephone in the Public House about a mile down the road. I suggest you use that.
Feel like talking to us. Answering a few questions?
Thank you very much, sir.
I've been doing nothing I shouldn't, sir. The millicents have nothing on me, brother, sir, I mean. Deltoid pulls Alex down on the bed.
Cut out all this clever talk about milicents. Just because the Police haven't picked you up lately doesn't, as you very well know, mean that you've not been up to some nastiness. There was a bit of a nastiness last night, yes. Some very extreme nastiness, yes. A few of a certain Billyboy's friends were ambluenced off late last night, yes. Your name was mentioned, the word's got thru to me by the usual channels. Certain friends of yours were named also. Oh, nobody can prove anything about anybody as usual, but I'm warning you, little Alex, being a good friend to you as always, the one man in this sore and sick community who wants to save you from yourself. Deltoid makes a grab for Alex's joint but finds his hand instead. Alex laughs. Derisively and rises. Deltoid distractedly reaches for a glass of water on the night table, and fails to notice a set of false teeth soaking in them. He drinks from the glass. The clink of the teeth sounding like ice-cubes.
And it just so happened that while they were showing me a particularly bad film, of like a concentration camp, the background music was playing Beethoven.
Um... oh no, sir, not exactly, I still feel very miserable, very much down in spirits.
It's this Health Farm. A bit out of the town. Isolated. It's owned by this like very rich ptitsa who lives there with her cats. The place is shut down for a week and she's completely on her own, and it's full up with like gold and silver and like jewels.
Who said that?
Certainly, sir. What do they call you at home?
You are now in H.M. Prison Parkmoor and from this moment you will address all prison officers as sir! Name?
Yes, sir.
Do you mean Church of England?
No, sir.
No, sir.
I'm your Psychiatrist.
Oh.
But, Sir... Missus... I see that it's wrong! It's wrong because it's like against like society. It's wrong because everybody has the right to live and be happy without being tolchocked and knifed.
Oh, thankyou, your honour. The Tramp takes a second look at Alex.
Fine, my boy, fine, fine.
Indeed.
But it is being used, isn't it, Father?
One pair of trousers - blue pinstriped.
Carry on, Chief.
And there's Will the English in the Muscleman coffee mesto saying he can fence anything that anything that any malchick tries to crast.
Well, it's a surprise all right, a bit bewildering too.
Well, fine... we could still look at C-Block.
Shall we go to my office?
We taking bets?  What if you're wrong?
You like Bach?
Let me guess.  Clarinet?
Different instrument altogether.  You know, if you'd only listened to me, we'd be bogged down in traffic right now, and you could have made yourself an extra five bucks.
Bottega.
Not quite.  He did defense.  I'm a prosecutor...
You never answered my question.  You like what you do?
But not now?
Listen to me!  Just listen, okay? There's a man, Vincent, he's coming to kill you!
Come on, it's been a long, shitty day. How about a break?  I'll call a tow truck myself, I swear.  I won't budge from this spot.
You heard Armstrong play live.  I've never been this jealous.  You get to talk to him?
The crowd had to dig it.
Tell me Vincent.  Tell me what you think.
Tell me.  Has Black Peter already crossed off a few bad children?
So?
Why didn't you tell me we had company?  And what's your name?
I'm sure you're very proud of Max.
You paid for my flowers?  They're beautiful.  Max, you gonna introduce us?
Oh.  Oh, thank God, hey!  Hey, guys, hey, help me out here!
Who is this?
Nothin'!  Aside from Max's mother driving me crazy, I'm dancin' on a rainbow!  Get him on the line, please.
You prefer nights?
No.  You say you're cool.
I'm making <u>you</u> nervous.  I'm the one with a schedule.
What are you doing?
It's a mess.
58th and Central.  You know it?
I can't believe this.
But, hey, some good news.  This last one put me way ahead of schedule. We've actually got some time to kill.  Jazz?  You like jazz?
Jazz.  Music.
Leave me alone.
I'm collateral anyway, so just fucking do it and stop making me a part of this!
She's in the hospital.
He hated everything I did.  Hated me. Got drunk and beat the shit out of me, daily...
Gimme your wallet.
Fifteen years, although I prefer the term "assassin."
Your lady friend.  The one who gave you her business card.  Think she was just being polite?
It's what I do for a living.
That's the "why."  That's the why? There is no reason.  No good reason; no bad reason.  To live or to die.
What happened to you?
Geronimo?
Look, I'm sorry --
Flip was a hero in Vietnam.
I still don't see what it has to do with the President.
What is?
I won't be here when you get back, but I'll be in touch.  And thanks.
As opposed to?
How long have we known each other, Jerry?
You have the right to ask me certain personal questions?
More about life on Mars.  From a rock they <u>found</u> on the South Pole. Explain that one to me.  But maybe we should go to Mars and find out? How much do you think that's going to cost?
You're certifiable.
You know why the Grateful Dead are always on tour?
Here it is.  <u>Conspiracy Theory</u>  It just went out Tuesday.  Third issue this year.  I bet I struck a nerve.  Pissed someone off.
'On July 8, 1979, security forces under control of the Trilateral Commission abducted the fathers of all American Nobel Prize winners. The men, many of them octogenarians, were forced at gunpoint to ejaculate into small plastic bottles.  The sperm collected is now under study in a laboratory beneath the headquarters of the Rand Corporation in Santa Monica, California.'
Who?
It made me feel like you could see inside of me.  And I don't know how that's possible.
Where'd you get your subscribers?
I'll be fine.  Let's worry about Henry Finch.  P.O. Box in St. Louis.  He's the last on the list. I haven't been able to reach him yet.
Sure. One of the richest men in America until he died a few days ago.
Right here in Manhattan.
Do you watch the news?  Read the paper.  Last week, this whole place was underwater.
I don't.  I know you wouldn't.
Now what?
What about them?
At a horse show.
Why?  What do these guys have to do with Ezekiel Walters?
How'd you get the picture?
Without a song in my heart.
Geronimo is down.
Thank you.
You should think of me as Liza Sutton's guardian angel.
It seemed like a possibility. What about your intentions?  Are they honorable?
You were going to ask about my nose.  The poor animal is slated to be destroyed today.
So he thinks NASA is plotting to kill the President?
Excuse me?
Not a man.  Ezekiel Walters.
I've been given a cease and desist on all matters relating to Jerry Fletcher.  We're not to discuss him with the press, the N.Y.P.D., anyone.  Building police are to arrest him on sight and we're to report any attempt he makes to contact you.
I want to believe you, too.
What gave me away?
I'm going to find him.  Because he'd find me.
What?
There's no plug to pull.
Yes, sir.
Goddamnit, they are out there, David --
With me.
David --
Ellie.
Ellie... you should know that I'm no longer the President's Science Advisor.
What?
... Two years is still a hell of a long time -- and as far as we can tell there aren't any provisions in the machine design for storing food, water, even air...
What?
1919+21.  Found a glitch in the timing; probably a starquake.
Here, right around Centaurus A.
I'm saying you might have consulted us; the contents of this message could be extremely sensitive...
And current theory holds that to sustain the sort of wormholes you're talking about, even for a fraction of a second, would require more energy than our sun produces in a year, is that correct?
Could we hear to China?
Pensacola.
I used... I used to dream you were alive... and then I'd wake up and lose you all over again.
Can you show me?
Please -- if you... downloaded... everything about us you know the problems we face, the impact it could have -- it could make the difference --
Hokkaido Island.
The systems integration site.
It's like the pre-Copernicans who swore the sun revolved around the Earth, or the Victorians at the end of the last century who concluded that all major discoveries had now been made.  I mean... try to imagine civilization a thousand years ahead of us -- then imagine trying to explain... I dunno, a microwave oven -- to someone even a hundred years ago -- I mean the basic concepts didn't exist...
How close are you to getting this funding put together?
We could be together again --
Ellie -- are you okay?
And there's no chance you had this experience simply because some part of you needed to have it?
Look, I'm a reasonable person, and reasonably intelligent.  But this experience went beyond both.  For the first time I had to consider the possibility that intellect, as wonderful as it is, is not the only way of comprehending the universe. That it was too small and inadequate a tool to deal with what it was faced with.
Did you love him?
I was referring to the selectees mingling with the selectors.
If you came back.
I read your book.
So.  The final countdown.
Ellie, what is it?
I can't do this --
What are my other options?  In fifty years?  Never?
I'm in love with you, Ellie.
They don't believe me.
It also makes God enormous.  I think of the scope of your universe, Ellie... and it takes my breath away.  As it will everyone else's.
But --
Maybe what you experienced can't be reduced to images on a videotape. Maybe they still plan to grant your request, only in their own way, in their own time... Or maybe it's just like you said:  ultimately their motives may be as incomprehensible as their technology.
I don't know.  Maybe we built the damn thing wrong.  Maybe it was all a hoax...  The safest thing would probably be to do a Chernobyl; encase it in concrete.
I don't think you understand. We made a deal ---
I allus hoped to see you well fixed and have me a crop of grandkids to kiss and fuss around with.
You think life is some kind of ocean voyage and you start out with buntin' and hollerin' and high hopes, but the damn ship goes down before you ever reach the other side. Luke?
Nothin'. Ever'thing's cool's can be.
Well, why not? Idee of marryin' got you all choked up, trying to pretend you was respectable you was borin' the hell out of all of us.
You was eyeballin', Luke. You can't gitcha mind on them weeds if yer eyeballin'...
What's all this dirt in the yard?
She's on to him. You shoulda waited fer me to git her out -- loose like she is, he kin run her crazy.
Well, we ain't never had one of them. Where'd you think that was gonna get you?
In the Navy, we used to call guys --
Had it done in Singapore. Bunch of us drunk as coots --
Borrowin'.
Uh-huh. And he ain't got nothing showing. Raise his head off.
So then you just call him.
A cold drink? You mean one cold drink? To feast yore starvin' fishy l'il eyes on The Picture? A true vision of Paradise itself? With two of the angels right there in plain sight a- friskin' round with mah boy?
I didn't say nothin', Boss.
Oh we got our sources... Tearing the heads off... what was it... gumball machines? What kind of thing is that for a grown man?
Course not. He ain't in the box 'cause a the joke played on him. He's there 'cause he back sassed a Free Man. They got their rules and we ain't got nothing to do with that. Woulda probably happened to him sooner or later, to a complainer like him. He's gotta learn the rules same as anybody else.
I'm gonna kill you, you go on...
We got it locked in the sock.
Don't hit me no more, Boss! Don't hit me! I'll do anythin' you say but just don't hit me! Oh Luke. You are an original, you truly are. You really fooled them.
What you mean, Luke?
Man Oh Man.
One, two, three... 
How about you tryin' to make me?
It's good medicine.
You parked right behind him.  The one I noticed earlier.  I didn't say anything, I thought he'd leave. Just take a look.
But earlier, he was staring up here.  <u>Please</u>, Andy.
Oh, God.  I must have looked horrible.
I want to die.
None of you know anything about it. Now go.  And Andy, if you persist in playing doctor, leave, with them.
We'll get the paramedics...
When was that?
Shut up -- I'm talking.  You got felony breaking and entering, burglary, felonious...
You don't listen very good.  This break in -- I can call it a felony -- three strikes, and you got about sixteen strikes already, and you're in jail for the rest of your life, no parole.  Or I could see it gets forgotten.
Then you get your ass outta here, I don't wanta see you again...
You break into her apartment to deliver a gift?  Where is it?
I think whatever is best for you, Daryll.  And maybe you're right, that's the place.
Conrad has the phone number. Conrad, where is he?
Mm-hmm.  I can't get to you.  You have to come to me.
We'll keep talking.  Until they get here.  Then... 
Do you have any evidence to report, ma'am?  Do you know any of the victims...
Sugar and cream for Goetz; I take mine black.  You're absolutely correct.  The politicians don't want panic headlines spoiling the Festival of Love.
Well, let's thank God you and Inspector Goetz are on the case, then.
Would you want to work with us on this?
The bodies have been carefully arranged... different positions, but somehow the same.  The positions are brutal... yet quite... artful.  It's like... a signature.  He's proud of his accomplishments.  There are early Picassos and late Picassos, but you always recognize the hand.  He wants us to recognize <u>his</u> hand. I've seen this hand before... what are you hiding?
One officer already got killed trying to protect me.  Please, just take it all away.  Leave me alone.
Nobody knows you have anything to do with this case; nothing has been on TV or the news... Why would he want to get in <u>your</u> computer?
Ruben.
There were needle marks.  But no drugs in her blood.
Who's going to catch him?  You?  And if you do, there'll be another one.  And one after that.
They're not talking to me.  Saks looks right through me.  I ask him for some bodies, for the phones -- he's so encouraging: "you make that <u>your</u> little job."  Condescending bastard.  Helen, on your lists to call is San Quentin.  Daryll Lee Cullum?
What happened to you?!
A man?  I thought he was a boy.  This last Christmas was the happiest Christmas I had in the last ten years... you know why?  It was the first Christmas in six years I was not in love.  Son of a bitch <u>married men</u>!  Who cares about marriage, the bed just gets crowded and noisy?!
I am not going to talk about it. How do you <u>know</u> it was Andy if the head was gone?  Where is the head? Are you looking for it?  Oh, God, why him?  Because of me.  I can't talk about it.  I write about things like this, stuff it all in books and bury it in libraries. This is the first person close to me who's ever died.  And it's because of me.  This monster killed him because I loved him.
You were the one that talked about moonbikes and called me a crank? Oh God, I <u>am</u>!  Make them some coffee.  Halloran, is it?  Investigator Goetz?  I had a crank call myself-- he said...  I thought it might be Daryll Lee Cullum.  I thought he might be out of prison.
It's a game they like to play. Berkowitz -- "Son of Sam" -- hung around the crime scene, talking to the cops.  This one's probably watching <u>you</u>, laughing at you.
The problem for me is... you're in the witness category.  Know what I mean?
The lock...
It's a woman shot in a car?
<u>What</u>?...
Okay.
Well, there's something missing in there.  There was something around her neck when I came in there, but it's gone now.
It's none of my business anymore...
Answer it.
Snotty neurotic bitch...
He's just mad he let me keep the espresso machine.  We heard from Doctor Hudson?
You said you don't give a fuck and that's the beauty of a breakdown? This doesn't look like not giving a fuck, you know that?
It's against your rules that I try to help a witness who's scared shitless?  Who's...
What's Abba?
You messed with the scene.
Am I in charge of this thing?  Or not.
It's not the same guy.  It should be a self-solver.  No bow around the neck, left and body outdoors, completely different.  The others were housewives, secretaries, he talked his way inside, killed them in their own living room or bed- or bathroom.  This one didn't have a husband or a boyfriend, no family, temp waitress, 3 arrests for misdemeanor dope offenses, DUI, asphyxiation probably from a plastic bag over her head.  Sexually assaulted.  The others weren't molested that way.  We're waiting for the sperm tests...
Teach both of them a lesson in cooperation and self-discipline.
Or the F.B.I.?
She's in no shape to give her statement tonight...
She left you, Nikko.  She's not your responsibility.  She takes very good care of herself.  If she wants to romance the kid, it ain't your business.  Your business is to snap out of it.
Did you come?
The sergeant asked me to identify it. He didn't believe you'd gotten out alive.
It is?
I wish I had. They bury the dead so quickly - they should leave them lying around for months.
You're not envious?
I think it's badly scarred too. From a motorcycle accident.
After this sort of thing, how do people manage to look at a car, let alone drive one?  I'm trying to find Charles's car.
You haven't told me where we're going.
Who is that? The announcer. Do I know him?
That's Vaughan. He talked to you at the hospital.
I saw the blood. It looks like motor oil.
You were the last one I saw just before the accident. Do you remember? We made love.
Can you drive?
I suspect it involves reenactments of famous car crashes. You know, Jayne Mansfield, James Dean, Albert Camus...
What does he want from you?
Do we have to talk about this?
The medicine's still bothering me. It feels like I have cotton wrapped around my brain.
It was just a little going-away gesture.
What's up with you?
How?
Sage, rosemary...  Les Herbes.
It'll be fine.
Loaned you. And it's only 'til you get out of here.
You did the right thing.
I've talked to Doctor Emlee, and he says...
Oh, OK, well, better to choose the table cloths first anyway.
I haven't had a crush since I was
You can only do what feels best to you now.
You've been so great. I just feel a lot clearer about things.
How do you sort it--by lace and cotton?
By color.
You took bets on my diagnosis?
John even managed to lob a load of mashed potatoes into Mrs. Hallstrom's milk.
Guess which hand.
For a price.
A small price.
No way.
Do you?
I do.
John and Nurse Gates are waiting for you.
Just checking.
No, I need some serious household advice.
I better make a list.
I love the pillows.
What do you say we go out to dinner to celebrate?
The store was busy.
You're going to miss the Top Ten.
Oh. And, Harry, he's the one who likes magic?
What is it? Are you OK?
Michael, take it easy.
What are we going to do?
Would that really be such a good idea for either of us?
I guess I should go now.
I'm sorry.  I'm just...I'm so tired lately.
What are you doing?
Yeah, I guess it's all right.
Of course not, no.  Is that why you're here?
So will you?
You what?
How's work going?    Are you back at school?
Our relationship meant a lot to me, too, Paul. But it's over.  And Michael being in the hospital doesn't really change things.
Well, I understand.     I know my behavior was poor.
I know, Letty. But the incident with Zach was frightening for the children.  Now if you'd come to me, explained what was going on...
It's a very nice letter. But I have to go with what's best for the students.
So Bastaldi makes a deal with the Feds to trade up for his brother?
Uh... excuse me, but don't you need a warrant or something?
Jesus.   What kind of FBI agent are you?
Oui.
Oui.
Can I offer you something.    A drink? Coffee?
You sure? I just got a shipment of espresso from Sicily. Special blend. Can't find anything like it in the States.
Okay.   How much?
To tell you that we're interested in the property.
I will relay the particulars of our conversation to Mr. Maranzano.
I understand Bobby Beans came to see you today.
Yeah. Seems Maranzano wants to talk about buying the Merchant Street warehouse.
And?
But you were there?
I don't know.
Why do I always have to answer the phone?
Bastaldi's dead. He is fuckin' dead!
You want Zero to kill him?
That's an excellent plan.     Very comforting.
We still have to get out of here.
What do you want now?
I've got a way with people.
-- Did you set it up?
What'd they take?
Everything.
Everything.
Well, I must say you're handling it very well.
Are you forgetting who supplements your income?
What about transportation?
What is it you do, Sami?
I knew this was a mistake! I knew it last night when you asked me to go along with this. I could hear that little voice in my head saying, "don't do it! Don't you do it!" Jesus, why don't I ever listen to myself?
This is bad. This is really fuckin' bad. Am I the only one who sees how bad this is?
Maybe I'm missing the obvious, but why aren't we leaving town? Any place has to be safer for us than Chicago.
Oh, man... this is bullshit!    You can't trust anyone these days.
When we get to the next corner jump out.
A Black Panther was a member of an African American militant group in the sixties, Marcel. I think you're referring to The Pink Panther.
I'm talking about human beings communicating openly and honestly.
No.   How much?
It's my idea.
C'mon, I look more like Elvis than you do.
The baseball is mine.
No.
Fuck you, grease-ball!
It's yours. A gift. A gift you could give to your brother... or anyone you owe money to as partial payment.
What does arresting us get them?
You ever hear of jet lag?
You ask a lot of questions.
Yeah. I mean besides that.    They treating you all right? Food okay?
Oh really? Thanks. I thought it was a sewing machine. What the hell is it doing here?
Then leave her to me.
Where's your master?
Stop talking like a monk!  Just fight!
That was just for fun.  How can I leave?  Where would I go?
It's the Giang Hu fighter lifestyle... kill or be killed. Exciting, isn't it?
I owe you nothing.
If I hadn't seen you fight with Li Mu Bai, I'd still be ignorant of all you've hidden from me.
Hello.  What is your name?
In that case, perhaps we could be of assistance.
The handle is heavy.  And the blade is no ordinary metal.  Still, the sword is the lightest of weapons. You're just not used to handling it.
Li Mu Bai!  The famous warrior? Why would he give his sword to Sir Te?
You know what I mean.  I'm getting married soon, but I haven't lived the life I want.
So I heard.  Congratulations.  It's the most important step in a woman's life, isn't it?
No!  You couldn't roam around freely if you were.
Am I?  I wish I were like the heroes in the books I read.  Like you and Li Mu Bai.  I guess I'm happy to be marrying.  But to be free to live my own life, to choose whom I love... That is true happiness.
I'm just borrowing some clean clothes.  I'm not staying.
Look at the trouble you've caused. Now you know what Giang Hu life is really like.  If you think of me as your sister, let me give you some sisterly advice.  You can run from marriage, but not your parents.
Where is he now?
How dare you accuse us?  I always knew you had stolen the sword! I've done nothing but protect you and your family.  And you're repaid me with nothing but contempt.  Li Mu Bai himself spared you, and all you do is insult him.  We wanted some peace and you've ruined it all! You're no sister of mine!
Without the Green Destiny, you are nothing.
No more hitting on the head!  All this trouble for a comb?
Mu Bai...It's been too long.
You use it justly, you're worthy of it.
Sir Te believes it's a ploy cast suspicion on Governor Yu.
Is there any place safer than under the nose of Governor Yu?
True.  But I must borrow it for one last mission.  Jade Fox must die at its edge.  Did you know what you were hiding when you covered for that girl?
She needs direction... and training.
That's not for her.  She should come to Wudan and become a disciple.
I wish there were something more I could do to help you.
Don't you want to see her again.
Please do not be such a stranger. You'll stay the night as my guest. Now, Shu Lien... tell me something. And forgive me for prying.  Your father was a great friend to me, and I think of you as my own daughter.
I beg your pardon.  Li Mu Bai and I aren't cowards.
Sure it coulda.  Funboy's not here, neither is T-Bird -- none of Top Dollar's number ones.
Don't any of your little pals have real, grown up names?
You, my friend, are dead.  I saw your body.  You got buried.
You died, man.  I can't believe it but here you are.  Last year, you and your girlfriend --
Fun -- look at that guy...
Can you play "Teddy Bears' Picnic?"  It used to be her favorite.
No.
Now do you get to see her? Shelly, I mean.
I don't know if I can.  But you have this... and you know where to come.
You don't even remember...
Owwwaaaa -- fuck me!  Look what you did to my sheets, you lame piece'a shit!  AAAAaa!  Goddd!
Coupla more rings... 24k.
18k.  Crap.
What's this -- a little, ah, bloodstain, right?  Fifty bucks for the box, and I'm doin' you a --
Like some sort of zombie on a revenge trip.
Who is only invulnerable so long as he cares about the dead.  When he begins to care about the living, you'll find his heart can bleed... and I want it to bleed for me.
No shooting.
I'm Kathryn.
Look, I know this sounds corny, but whenever I feel like I can't go on I...  turn to Jesus and he helps me through the problem. Call me an anachronism, but -
Kathryn, I know all about you and Sebastian.
Sebastian was a pathological liar. I wouldn't believe a word he -
You can't do this to me. It could ruin me.
Nothing.
Annette, how long have we known each other?
Take yourself. You've slept with several women. Are you happier because of it?
You've read The Fountainhead?
Oh come on. Quit acting like a geriatric and get in the pool.
You know it amazes me that someone as bright as you can be so horrible.
About what?
I'm sorry, but you're not my type.
No thank you.
Oh right, last night. I guess I owe you an apology.
I thought we agreed that we were going to be friends.
Tell me what to do, Annette. How can I win your heart. I'll do anything. I can't get you out of my mind.
I'll leave this afternoon. Happy?
Well, I was just calling to tell you I was thinking about you and I miss you. I'll let you go.
What?
You must take me for a real idiot.
I do not.
I have feelings for you.
You don't know how to love.
My mother and I used to ride a lot, before she got sick.
Any ideas who it could be?
Blaine, if I knew who it was that person wouldn't be alive right now.
Hmmm. I do believe Bravo is showing Spartacus on television tonight.
What was that?
Really? Bulimic headcase.
Ah duh. Boys. I've never even gone to first base with a guy. What do I do?
That's so romantic. Have you responded?
I want you to make me copies of his letters and bring them to me.
Cecile, you have to tell me.
I don't know.
Just taking your photo.
Is it me?
But you said you have the worst reputation.
Come on Greg. You're the only one who knows her. The truth will save you.
And you think she bought it?
I told you I don't know.
Hello.
Cecile's attending Oakwood in the fall.
Oh, poor baby. Well you can relax. I have a mission for you.
Oh come on, Kathryn. It's too easy. "But I thought high school was only four years." I mean, please. She knows nothing. She's seen nothing. I could have her under the table at Au Bar sucking me off before the appetizer arrived. Go get one of those moron friends of yours to do it. I have a reputation to uphold.
It just so happens we're not in Kansas anymore. Our little angel's father has accepted the new headmaster position at Oakwood. She's staying with my aunt up in Connecticut while Daddy sells his house. Can you imagine what this would do for my reputation? Screwing the new headmaster's virginal daughter before school starts? It will be my greatest victory.
Care to make a wager on that?
Be more specific.
Fuck her yet?
I'm working on it.
Moving along quite well.
Morning!
So? How'd it go last night?
Where is she?
No, tell me.
And that's why you're leaving?
I'm sorry. It's just upsetting. You're in love with her. You don't love me anymore.
Mind if I ask what you're doing in my room?
I'd love to, but unfortunately I'm expecting some company.
Get off me!
Get out? We had an arrangement.
And if I don't?
Don't worry, it's totally understandable. Most of the boys that matriculate at Oakwood are very upstanding gentleman, however there are the occasional bad apples.
I got your message and came as quick as I could.
Not at all. What's wrong?
It's worse. I think there's something going on between Cecile and her music teacher.
I'm paying you to give cello lessons. Not to pervert my child.
Mrs. Caldwell I think you're misunderstanding something.
Well please leave a message that I called.
Later. Listen, we're entertaining some guests so -
It's really important.
Where the hell do you come off hitting women?
Kathryn. Did you hit her?
The song I was trying to hum. The song my friend, taught me.
Did you ever make a wish?
No dear. I don't know them, but I've heard about them.
Edward will give you your breakfast, Amy.
Well, it shows imagination, anyhow.
I know, dear.  I understand. But try to worry a little less about her -- be a little easier in your thinking.  And especially today  let's forget about it. We want a really bang-up birthday party, don't we?
What is it, Alice?
What's funny?
No, she went runnin' off to some old house she was talkin' about yesterday.
I live right here.
Where did you mail them?
But wishes don't come true.
Now Amy
Just you wait!
Yes, Amy?
In the garden? Would she be there now?
Where, Amy? Where do you see her?
But you must!
A princess?
There's an oak leaf.  Add a maple.
I can sea its breath in the cold.
It's a warm breath -- warm and strong  warmed by the sunlight that shone on the deer's back in the hot summer; sweet with leaves and mosses.
Maybe, if it's a real mourning ring like we have in Jamaica. All you got to do is turn it on your finger, close your eyes, and make a wish.
I'm trying to.
Will you come soon?
Because it can't. It's dead.
I've been watching you. You couldn't see me, but I could see you. It was like peeking through a slit in the curtain before the play began. You would be a very good audience. I can see that.
If you were the lady who gave me a ring, my mother says I have to give it back to you.
I brought you a present. Merry Christmas.
I hate the storm. I hate it!
Promise me you won't forget tomorrow. You'll remember, won't you? You won't say that it was just a dream. Promise me.
I-shan't see her. No, Barbara, no.
It's some animal hurt in the woods that made that sound.
I don't believe in PMS. Women made it up just so they can be bitchy.
And keep a journal of your symptoms to make sure it's related to your period and not just in your head.
That bite healed up quickly. It's been about three weeks?
Diet and exercise, that's all there is. I'm not a big proponent of the PMS craze, but there's a book my wife mentioned called "The PMS Diet," which may be helpful.
We're worried about you. "60 Minutes" was on same-sex couples.
I never thought of it like that. I never know what to do on dates. Do guys still pay?
Did I kill him? Of course not!
And then?
He was cute, huh? Of course whenever I meet a guy, I'm wearing no make-up.
I'm sorry. I didn't want you to think I was still a doormat.
Give him the tampon test.
I'm freaking out. I'm like an animal and totally out of control. My arms keep getting really hairy.
We almost slept together... and... then the hair started and I booked.
It's just as well. I'm afraid of getting hurt again. Mark seemed great at first too. I don't want to get too attached to Peter and then find out he's a creep.
Bag means condom now? I can't keep up with the word "bag." It used to be "No, that's not my bag" -- meaning not my thing. But now "my bag" means "my fault."
Geez, I wish I'd get it like that.
Jennifer. A severed arm. It's bloody and... I'm not sure but it may be Carlton's.
Oh my god Jennifer. I should go to confession.
He's been here all night?
What happened to his tooth?
There's kind of this guy I'm seeing.
How could I? I'm helping you clean up Mark's remains and you ask how could I cheat on George?
"Paranoia, insecurity, depression, changes in vision, feelings of losing control; belief that you have a mental problem..." Nothing about turning into a werewolf.
She died at age 34 in the 1800's. They thought she was crazy. She was banished from her town. Seems her husband shot her.
I think George knows.
About Benito.
I'm not really hungry after all.
Well, whattdaya think?
I'd really feel more comfortable paying for my half of the dinner.
I'm really tired.
What?
You look different. I mean you look good.
Yes, that's what we're looking for.
I think we should do something with strong female characters...
Mr. Grant. Did you read that script I was talking about?
You wanna get some coffee?
I'm trying to stay away from caffeine.
Used to? Did it stop finally?
We lived in northern Minnesota. She went for a walk one night and they never found her body -- just her torn apart clothes with her blood and wolf blood on them. Then the town rounded up bunch of hunters and shot all the wolves in the area.
Oh, nothing's wrong. Just... well don't you have your period?
No, I got it. It's okay.
I thought we were starting something... and then... I know it's unorthodox, I mean with you being involved in the case and all.
What's with the squirt guns?
Your breasts feel larger.
Hello?
You want the truth? Remember I tried to tell you something the other day?
I knew you wouldn't kill me.
That I'm a doormat of course. The shrink makes more notes.
I think I'm a werewolf.
I ate a guy last night.
It's about Gregory Jameson. He's dead.
No, it was our first date.
We can get a warrant if you like.
No. We left the restaurant, and... and I felt sick... so... so I took a cab home. Alone.
You can't believe this bullshit.
How the hell is that your business?
Why would you want to be a cop?
You're some catch Lloyd.
I still don't get when you gave her back the pillowcase.
You think mafia hit?
I know. I followed you. To the zoo, to her house, to your house...
I need something to keep me awake.
What about Thompson, sir?  Wasnt this his case?
Thompson suffered a kind of severe delusion or some damn thing.  Anyway he isnt with us any longer.  The case is yours.  Go through his files. Take what you need.  By the way, hows your mother?
Who is it?
Such a joker!  Like your father.
Where does it lead?
Then we must call the police.
You remember nothing?  Who you are? What you've done?
If you like.
Not that again...
How do I get there?  Tell me.
Wave from the door... go down the stairs... get into the limo...
`Cause you know I can do other stuff. I mean,  if you wanted me to talk or...
What?
First Lady...
The Washington Post.
Choices???
What do you think you're doing?!
I'm... not... nobody...
She's a little hysterical right now. We've got her upstairs in a laundry room.
Look... at some point we're going to have to call the Vice President...
Like how?
Mild stroke?
I got the nurses for fifty grand a piece and the doctors for a hundred. The older one wanted head of the CDC.
Clean.
It's gonna be great.  'Caring about his wife.'  'Spending time on her favorite issue...'
Couple of days.  Anyhow, look at these tracking polls, they'll burn up in your hands: seventy- three percent with seniors, eighty- four with working mothers...
Bob...
I don't think so
I just think they make this stuff a lot more complicated than it has to be.
Thanks. You did great.  Maybe later you could come back and we could go to Camp David or something.
In fact, we think you did such a good job, we'd like to extend things a little bit.
Right.  Now whenever he stands at a Podium, the President always puts one hand in the pocket of his coat...
Dave!
Yeah, but the First Lady... Couldn't we start with a cousin or something?
Fine.
Yes, Mr. President?
Does it make the cars any better?
All I've got is my integrity.  That's all I have.  Now I don't know why you turned your attack dogs on me.
They re not my attack dogs.
You're not?
I was waiting for that jack.
That's okay.  You alright down here by yourself?
Well...
Oh yeah?  Me, too.
I mean, what is it?  Another Secretary? A jaunt to the Bahamas with Some 'campaign worker.'  Where is he?
Where are you going?
Where's home?
How were you gonna get home?
I don't mind.
It was okay?
What's wrong?
I missed...
... Not exactly the Oval Office.
Who's this priest I'm thanking?
To look...look for a place...a place to live in...an empty place...a... new...place...
Help me get him to the boat.
I'm sorry. I was...busy. In the lab.
THIS IS A TRAVESTY! CAPTAIN RHODES IS...
Bees. That's what we call the dead... the walking dead...here on Gasparilla's island.
We ran up against a platoon of soldiers. There were actually walking dead...in uniform...with guns.
It's a disease. It's a...a bug...a parasite that infects the brain.
We thought we were escaping here. We thought we'd found an uninhabited island. Christ! This place is a worse nightmare than anything I've seen yet!
We always planned to use it. We got some ground up already...but we could never find enough.
What?
It won't work. That's pure nitro you're dealin' with there. That stuff can blow if you look at is funny. What're you gonna do, walk into the Cave carryin' those tubes on feather pillows? You don't have a complete layout of the place. Even if you manage to avoid a fight you won't know where to go.
But...we bury the heads. Oh. God! It must be torture for them!
He is dying. He knows it.
I had an unfortunate little run-in with him today. In fact...you might say that Mr. Tyler is in big trouble with the...authorities.
Mary.
No time for that. I'll take care of them.
No relation.  Never heard of him. Sorry.
Don't come.
Can you believe it?  She was gonna call me!  She invited me to a party with her!
Well...
Mr. Keating!
You're siding with Mr. Nolan?!  What about carpe diem and sucking all the marrow out of life and all that?
What?
It's only me, Mr. Nolan.  I swear. I made it up.
Todd's brother is Jeffrey Anderson.
You still shouldn't have done it, Charlie.  You don't speak for the club.
It's all right, Chet.
It does?  What?
Stop what?
Knox, I don't believe this!
Then come with me.
God, if Chet found out he'd...
We used to meet here on special occasions. Who would like to convene the meeting?
English.  Way before your time.  It was hard giving it up, I'll tell you.  I'm hearing rumors, John, of some unusual teaching methods in your classroom.  I'm not saying they have anything to do with the Dalton boy's outburst, but I don't think I have to warn you that boys his age are very impressionable.
What was going on in the courtyard the other day?
Yawp!
A crazy madman.
What did the name mean.  Did you only read dead poets.
Oh Captain, My Captain, we came here so I could talk to you about something.
Wait a minute.  I don't let my parents walk on me.
I certainly wouldn't lose any sleep over it.  It's just a bunch of people trying to impress Nolan.
Neil, you are going to quit this ridiculous play immediately.
I say we go tonight.  Everybody in?
My brother went here.
A play, dummy.
Todd, what's the matter?
Yea, art thou there?
Visit from my father.
Right here...middle of nowhere...
Which question is that?
This isn't right Finnegan. I've got a contract.
Who asked any?
Hanover, listen...
That's where my boat's moored.
But what makes you think there aren't more of those...things...back there?
Look lady, I know you people are used to getting your way...
You people...rich people...
Since I'm a kid, I had this dream... I want to own my own tropical island... Beaches, warm ocean, lots of food, little clothes...population of one...
So how do you get from the Bronx to the South China sea?
I don't take orders at all.
So?
Can we use our indoor voice please...
Squid...squid like...squid type... it's got tentacles, a feed sac... probably one central nervous processor somewhere...what the hell do I know is going on deep down in the ocean...there's all sorts of shit we've never seen...eighty foot clams...60 foot sharks...I'm just guessing...can you get me more juice out of Hercules...fast?
I think we gotta stop floating from one fucked up situation to the next...
Second whistle you make it to the deck and get ready to jump...
What the hell does that mean?
Someone's back there.
She fucked you?
I'll get the boots.
They did too!
What the --!
Where the hell were you? We were all set -- beer, broads. Right? Am I right?
Let's go!!!
You talk to him?
Naw.
Merle? That's who we're looking for. Merle.
Not so good.
Biederman, yes.
I'd want to pay you... and I was thinking --
I don't know what we've been waiting for!
Fine. I just go along, you know. Down at the market. Back here. I mean it just seems there's a million things to do!... Are you sure you're all right? I mean, what about the wound?
That was nothing. That wasn't anything.
Naw, it's... I mean...
Up north.
Where are we going, Merle? Are we going home?
I just wait. For this... It's what I wait for... I wait all year.
You think about it?
Pow.
Hell no!
Hunt with Vince?
Listen, asshole, it's up to us!
Okay, okay!  Okay. Okay, you're right... What about Sal?
Forget Sal.
What do you mean?
Forget Sal... Listen to me -- forget Sal! I've been working on Sal since dawn, Nick. Sal's in a dream and he won't come out. LISTEN!!! From here on you gotta go for you. You hear me? For you!
When you get the AK, open up. You got me? Open up.
How's Linda?
I'll betcha! That's bullshit and I'll betcha! You're fulla shit!
What do you mean, no???
Some fuckin' friend... You're some fuckin' friend, Merle!
This is this, Vince. This isn't something else. This is this!
John Wayne... Listen, Nick --
What?
No.
Yeah.
It's okay. Hey, it's okay! Just a week. Just to see Phantom Mary.
Yeah!
Oh, Jesus!  You're kiddin'!
What'cha got, Bennett?
That's him.  Simon Doucet.
Speak up.
It was Wade's old partner... Gallagher. He was behind it all.
You son-of-a-bitch.  How do you stop it?
Give it to me.
This is a war, Wade.  You against him.  Vengeance time.  The City's just in the way.  Kill the fucker. You and me.  We'll work things out when the time is right.
I heard about today.  Good job.  I'm all for capital punishment.  Why don't you go home and see your family?
But sir, Sergeant Wade saved the hostages.
Sir, your dinner with the union leaders begins in an hour.  Your wife will meet you there, so we can leave whenever you're ready.
Sir, your limo's here.
Maybe I should put on the training whe---
You my partner?
You have to use the steering wheel to turn.  The pedal for gas...
See those guys?
There's no time.  There are civilians in there.  It's about to go down.
We don't know that for sure.  We'll have to wait until they move.
Yes.
NPA metamorphosis should biologically slow him down.  That's when we'll get him.
You can't catch this man with a computer.
Sir, I took the liberty of running a GCI scenario on a TM-1 earlier today...
You want to be a good detective?
This should make your day.  The guy who testified against you... Dubbs... was arrested a total number of twenty- four times.
Jesus, Sanchez... what do you think you're doin'?  That's flatfoot data. You're not supposed to have access to that.
But he was such a good cop.
Seat's too high.
We'll cook 'em ourselves. You'll help me, Belle.
What are those people doing there? What do they want?
Who are these people?
I know -- and you could show me the door. You would, too, if you weren't still hoping the guests might arrive.
I don't want to be up there all alone, Mama.... I want to be with you.
Grandma, look at me!
Howdy, Jabez.
Kin you spare a moment for me Jabez?
Why, of course, Hank -- I've always got time for a neighbor. What's on your mind?
Not at all, Hank ... not at all. Glad to help you.
Never mind. What's your name?
Almost seven.  No -- no, he's not seven yet I am sure --
Are you plumb crazy, man! What do you think happens? We're buried -- that's all.
Why do you fret about something that isn't there?
Opportunities?
Where did it come from?
Yes, why shouldn't it?
Small? Oh, I see what you mean. Why, they vary.  Now a man like Daniel Webster, if I ever get hold of him, I'd have to build a special box for him and even at that, I imagine, the wing spread would be astonishing.  In your case --
Oh no, you violated clause five of our contract and I could collect right now, if I chose.
About what?
I see. And this is where he'd like to collect, too.
Oh, Jabez.
He's stubborn as a Stone.
Well, I'll be -- there's a rig, turning in, by the gate.
Your butter money?
Not all of it?
Jabez -- you ought to talk to Tom about joining the Grange.
Mary -- what would you do?
But I'm glad to be home again --
Yes -- you are right, Mary. I can almost hear the little blades of grass a-starting up -- All the seeds a-stirring underneath the ground --
You could have knocked me down with a feather -- Selectman -- me.
It's very becoming to you, Mr. Selectman.
But it's not very becoming to you to have your hands in the suds -- when the Squire and his wife --
Jabez -- how can you let her talk like that when the boy is present? He won't respect me any more.
Mr. Webster ... Wait! ...  Mary!
Now, Jabez Stone -- as for what you're calling hard luck -- well, we made New England out of it. That and codfish.
I know, Ma, but -- Suppose a man got his money in bad ways --
Now that's the way to talk, Son! I know you worked hard for that crop. But we'll make out.
Ma -- is she? --
The new girl -- Jabez says; she is from over the mountain.
Mary! Ready? First bell's a-ringing!
Me? Why, look here, Mary Stone -- I'm worried about you, that's all.
You've got a smart man, Mrs. Stone. Hang onto him.
No, you wouldn't -- You're not the sort of woman that's afraid of smoke -- or fire -- But now let's talk about your affairs.
Yes, you've chatted a lot, woman-like nibbling around the edge -- But, Mary, forgive an old lawyer's legal mind, I don't think you ever once came to the point. And there is a point, isn't there?
Mr. Webster, you mustn't believe all that people say.
Jabez ...
Someone to see you, Dan'l!
With the presidential election coming up, I thought I could be of some help, sir.
Why, certainly -- but be careful, Mr. Scratch -- Medford rum has an uncanny habit of kicking back, even with old-timers like yourself. 
There isn't enough Medford rum in the whole of New Hampshire to make me sleepy. 
But meant her moving here.
Hans, he killed by brother --
I don't know it!  get on a Goddamn jet to Tokyo and ask the chairman! I'm telling you!  You're just going to have to kill me --
--ohGodplease -- don't kill me -- don't kill me -- you're one of them, I know it --
New York...
No more jokes, drop it or she gets it between the eyes!
Thirty minutes to break the code... Two hours for the five mechanicals. The seventh lock...that's out of my hands.
Got it...'Roy'.  Now listen.  If you think of anything else you think we need to know, don't be shy, okay? In the meantime I want you to find a safe place and hole-up and let us do our job.  Understand?
I'm here, Roy, but I'm, uh, kind of busy.  Let's talk later, okay?
The plastique I found.  Is the building on fire?
Powell?  What's going on?
Roy?
Bullshit.
I never make bets or guesses, that way I'm never wrong and I never have to pay out.
These seats come out?
Aw, hey...
Well, how'll I get home?
Sonny, there's somebody under that desk over there... I'm sorry...
Jenny?
Hello.  Hello, Leon.
Yeah.  It was terrible.
So... that sure is something.
I'm not on the phone to talk to you about that.  Well, I don't know what to say, Leon.  When you gimme that... when you hit me with that shit.  I mean, what am I supposed to say?
I gotta jet coming here and we're gonna try to get the fuck outta this thing.  And we're gonna go, man!
That's it.
You're really crazy.
Why you going to Algeria?
Howard Johnson's... you're warped. You know that?  You're really warped!
Sal?  Yeah... Sal is with me.
Oh... wow!  Sonny, you're really into one mess now.
I know I am.  I know!
Shit...
All right.  Then what do you want me to say?
Yeah.
Look... don't throw that on me.
Well, then...
You're in it up to your ass, Leon. You're an accessory.  You talk him out of there and they might be a little more understanding of your case.
Oh, no ... Women is all we got.
Come on.  I want you to see something.
What?
I want to see my wife.  I want you to bring her down here.
I'm not ... I'm not ... you're gettin' a bus ... you're gettin' a bus ... the jet's comin' into Kennedy ... and your wife's on the way ... what else do you need? What else can I get you?  Listen, I don't know how you can do better ... see that man over there ... the FBI guy ...
What else?
He hasn't so far.  I'm the one who can make a mistake.  That's what scares the shit out of me.
Hello... I'm sorry I can't talk to you right now... I suggest you call during banking hours tomorrow. What is your name?
Now, you -- what's your name?
I don't care who you are ...  I just want to get you outta here, safe, right?
Would I hire you?
You were terrific, too!
No, not until after they killed him.
Goddamn women...
It's the cops.  Shit!
I want him to think that.
To show that we're negotiating.
Does that still go?
Sonny -
Yeah ...
He was talkin' about arrangements ... we were talkin' about the TV.
I'm here.
Aw, Jesus ... you been doin' us favors all night!
I want them all.
That's the jet.  You give us one more, now.  That's the deal...
Hey, let's get ready!
She doesn't have anything to do with it!  You understand that? Mother?  This is me!
I know you wouldn't need Leon if Heidi was treating you right.  The thing I don't understand is why you come out and sleep with Heidi anyway?  You got two kids on welfare now.  What're you goin' to bed with her, you don't have enough with one wife and two kids on welfare, you want a wife and three kids on welfare?
Not now, Mom, please.
How much you have to pay an entertainer to fill this slot?
What do you want us to give you? You want to be paid for ...
This is Drake Bishop.
What?
Why the hell are we delivering them out here? I can't even find any warrants in the system for these four.

Uhhh... I have no idea what you just said.
They need to get the introduction on camera. Just play along, alright?
I be.  I'm living large.
Yeah, I know dat motherfucker.
He makes all his money off us Black people and I don't see nuthin' but Italians all up in there, Sylvester Stallone and motherfuckers.  Ya see what I'm saying, homeboy?
That's not even true.  I just want a slice.
Extra cheese is two dollars. Y'know dat.
Sal, that might be fine, you own this, but rarely do I see any Italian Americans eating in here. All I've ever seen is Black folks. So since we spend much money here, we do have some say.
What da fuck!  Are you deaf?
You the man.
As I was saying before we were so rudely interrupted by the finest.
What can you say?
Hold your tongue.  You don't have that much love.
Eddie Lovell.
Don't you have enough sense not to bother people when they're sleeping?
Wake up?  Saturday is the lone day I get to sleep late.
I think no such a thing.  Sal pays you, you should work.
No, you're tripping.  Don't come in Sal's.  Alright, read my lips.
Nice!
What?
Can you pay me now?
Sal, just do me a favor, leave Jade alone.
C'mon, Sal.
Mookie, I always liked you.  Not the smartest kid, but you're honest. Don't make me dislike you.
When?
Shit!  I forgot.
I can't be staying long anyway.
Mookie, I told you already it's too fucking hot to make love.
Tina, you're sweating.
Of course I'm sweating.  I'm burning up.  It's hot, moron, only a hundred degrees in here.
Feels good.
Y'know, I've been listening and reading 'bout Farrakhan, ya didn't know that, did you?
I didn't know you could read.
If you don't make a stand, he's gonna be beating ya like a egg for the rest of your life.
Pino, get a broom and sweep out front.
Hey!  Watch it.
Sal's Famous Pizzeria, yeah, two large pizzas, pepperoni and anchovies, hold on...  See, Pop, Mookie fucking talking on the phone and people are trying to call in orders.  He's making us lose business.
Pop, I think we should sell this place, get outta here while we're still ahead...and alive.
Too many pizzerias already there.
Then we could try something else.
Baby listen, there's nothing more American than not doing anything and getting away with it.
She's saying... a beautiful swan...
Oh, yeah. I don't think they do. You're new here, right?
Four colors? Neato!
Tomorrow we go on a fee-eee-eee- wald twrip.
Ooh gross.
Okay, there's a lot for us to go over, so it may get hard for you.
Hard for me? Hard for me? Hard for me? Hard for me?  You had questions?
I checked with the school board, she's not an accredited teacher.
She says that she's got more important things to do now that the new mall opened.
Po, po, position...? Hey, here's thought, have you a bathroom?
The name's Walter.
No, I'm fine thanks.
Yes, Harry. I can't home school you anymore. So maybe it's time to make some new friends, some friends your own age...
I haven't seen you around here before.
Home school. Til today.
No no no no no.
You know Harry, this is my favorite time of day.
Exactly! A pirate!
If he heard you talking like that he'd make you walk the plank.  Three, two, one. Now it's your turn, spin.
No.
...and who was Benjamin Franklin again?
...cause you said...
What?
Who's your partner?
You and me? Dream on, desperado.
I think she wants me to come over to put me into the right position to check out her delicates, what ever that means.
You know... She's gonna be all over you like a barrel of monkeys, with her tight shirt and short skirt... Eeeww, it's so faggy I can't even talk about it.
You can't marry my mom.
It's really not up to you, Harry. But we just want you to feel like you're part of the decision.
I don't think so.
She wants me to stay for dinner, I don't know what to say to her.
Don't snap at me like that. You're lucky I don't punch you right in the face.
No one knows?
Me, me, me!
Wow, we built a whole float in one afternoon. And now the reward.
You certainly did.
You found my treasure? Why didn't you tell me.
HARRY, we found the real thing to be thankful for. Screw George Washington!
Hey there goes Principal Collins!
Oh my God! She's two-timing PRINCIPAL COLLINS!
Try one in a million!
Well, what have we here? It appears be a tape.
Hey, Turk rescued you from the nerd. You're in!
HARRY, I heard Collins has you in some kind of special class.
I'm so close I can feel it.
That's it. I'm done.
Go in there and get us two slushees.
He passed away three years ago.
You know I do!
He was a big loser! What are you deaf!?
Left here! Left!
It's the big potato.
Oh, this is fantastic. So all we have to do is kill this Moffit guy and we get all the money!
You got the Extender?
So what do you keep in there?
The evidence of what?
The ring?... he was brought to us as is, Baron.  I...
What happens now?
Their minds are so.... They move in strange directions....
Forced spice evolution of humans changes many things.... I must sit close to him.
He will not permit anyone but me to see him. You must be outside this room.... Do what you can.
Many machines on Ix... new machines.
Shield practice? Gurney... we had practice -- this morning..... I'm not in the mood.
Not in the mood?! Mood's a thing for cattle and love play... not fighting.
Are you trained in the ways of the desert?
I can't maintain any altitude... we'll never reach the safety of rock.  Maybe that small rock.
No.
You have strength... real strength... You shall be known as Usul, which is the strength of the base of the pillar.  This is your secret name in our troop.  But you must choose the name of manhood which we will call you openly.
The Water of Life.
My own name is a killing word.  Will it be a healing word as well?
What's in the box?
Your mother wants you to tell me about your dreams. I only want to know one thing.... Do they come true?
You mustn't speak of...
It's a pleasure...
Yes.  There is nothing more comfortable.
Who are you?  What do you want?
I never thought of that.
Eddie, you got a new movie for me?!
Well, It's about how people have two personalities.  The side they show to the world, and then the secret person they hide inside.
Bela! It's so great to see you!  And eight o'clock on the dot.  Right on time!
Those bastards at Universal.  I made so much money for them, and now I can't get the time of day.
Bela, don't worry.  You're better than all this crap.
I'm not getting near that goddamn thing.  One of those burned me on "The Return Of Chandu."
Once you're in it, it warms up.
Buddy, I don't know if that's such a good idea.
Bela, I'm on your side.  C'mon, give me the gun...  If you give me the gun, I'll make you a drink.  What are you drinking?
Isn't it wonderful?  After all these years, the press is showing an interest again in Bela Lugosi.
Oh.  So what is the scene about?
Don't you want a second take, for protection?
What do you think you're doin'?!
Edward Wood, Sir.
I don't understand.
Bravo!  Bravo!  Magnifico!
Cris, you made it.  Thanks a lot.
Honey, what if I'm wrong?  What if I just don't have it?
Ed, it was only one review.
You got the job?!!
No!  A horror movie star!
Boy, I can't even remember the last time he was in a picture.
Toss us out on our ass.
That's Tony McCoy.  He's playing Lieutenant Dick Craig.
Pleased to meet you.  I'm Loretta King.
Oh, of course!!  There's a couple characters you'd be perfect for: The secretary at the newspaper office, or the file clerk!
Sorry to bother you while we're shooting, but the guy who owns the stage needs his money.
Yeah.  Well I need the other sixty-thousand.
Hey big shot, get off your ass.  They need a potted palm over in the Carl Laemmle Building.
That's not true --
Well, Mr. Feldman, some people have resumes to show.  I've got my own movie.
Okay -- you know what you do?  You produce a film in a commercially proven genre.  And after it's a hit, you take the profits from <u>that</u>, and make the twelve Apostles' movies.
Yes, but I've got the last footage he ever shot!
So, Mr. Johnson --
I like.  When do movie shoot?
Really?  Was the third act too intense?
I'd be happy too, if I had such a great family.
Tor, I should be getting home.
You gotta be kiddin' me.
<u>Then how's it gonna get in the</u> <u>picture</u>?!
Um, I guess --
Georgie, what's with the stag footage??  You said you were cutting in <u>establishing shots</u>!
Booties for my father.  He gets cold in this hospital.
I just picked them up on the way over...
I had to sleep with the lights on for a month.  But I never missed a Lugosi picture after that.
Kathy, I'm about to tell you something I've never told any girl on a first date.  But I think it's important that you know.  I like to wear women's clothes.
Excuse me, Miss Vampira?
No, don't worry, I moved on.  I was just calling to see if you want to attend the world premiere of my new film, "Bride Of The Monster."
You don't wanna be noticed?
We couldn't afford any more props. If it seems weird, maybe you can add a scene where they eat dinner.
Yes!
Norma, this is Bela -- Bela, this is Norma.  Norma, this is Tor -- Tor, this is Norma.  Norma, this is Paul Paul, this is Norma.
Ah, c'mon!  Nobody does all that.
Two people do.  Orson Welles and me.
Our neighbors gave me a ride.
Oh, Al ... This is just...
Did you see that?
So?
Ooh, the sister! She is hot.
Cool.
Uh-huh?
What if Shari's the dream?
Ed, do you want my advice?
No. You screwed up my life just so you could get higher ratings. You never gave a shit about me.
This guy.
I'm Dr. Geller. Your mother is just lying down for a few minutes. we gave her something to calm her down.
Thank you. Can I see her?
You know who we are?
And then, uh... you know it blew over and he went back to being a fireman again.
Eddie? ...
Do you want us to come in the kitchen?
Oh my God!
Both.
He... apologized, he begged me. He can be very... charming when it suits his purpose.
So does Grandma. So does Shaquille O'Neal. You told me you had a hysterectomy and he ran off with your nurse.
Hank! All of a sudden. Because now you're famous and he can get something from you. I don't wan you to become a victim like Marcia.  Not that you're a victim, honey. You're not. Life's just been a little hard on you, sweetie.
Eddie...
He's dead! Eddie, he's dead! It was his heart.
She left. She moved. She got Fed-Ex to give her a transfer and she left. She couldn't stand it anymore. We had people, news people, regular people, just sleeping in our hallway, going through our mail, our garbage. I mean it was she couldn't take it anymore. Now I've got to move. I can't afford this place by myself.
Well, Ed, that's ... not really possible.
Are you asking me?
Oh, Christ. Did you go to bat for me?
Yeah...
I saw this show once. It was about logging. I was home sick, there was nothing else on. Do you know how they break up really bad log jams? You know, when they're really tangled... ?
I mean bad.
Can't we just --
That's lucky.
Um...
So? What do they think -- we're not kids --
Exactly. Boy, you're smart.  Why are you so mean to her? What did she do to you?  "Is she good enough for Ed?" Who the hell am I?  Who the hell do you think I should be dating?
Yeah... I saw that girl come on to you at the TV show.
Ray borrowed this whole tub of money against this balloon payment that I don't get if I qu -- it's too complicated. I -- Besides...
This is going right up your ass.
No, this is great.  You'll love this.  He's a singer.
Hello... Shari, hi... Oh no! ... Oh God!
It's the receptionist at one of the places I service video equipment -- she's very pretty and, you know, she never even talks to me and then today I come in and she's all "I saw you on TV the other night... You were so great ... " Next thing I know we're ...
Cliff left her, thanks to you.
Hello.
The last two years, I've been a limousine driver, but I don't see well anymore, so...
That girl's an idiot.
We have to stop meeting like this.
No. It's going to be about a half-hour.
Good?
Yo --
What do you mean? What kind of person am I?
Tracy, I've been watching you for going on two years now, and I think you are one of the most talented, hard-working, sensitive, attractive, brilliant students -- no, human beings -- I have ever met.  I mean, you're the real thing.  Special.
How'd it go?
Fine.  So do your count.  Start with president, and I'll be right back.
He's right. Two people must have pocketed their ballots. Usually it's more.
I can't wait to start campaigning.
You know, Mr. M., when I win the presidency, that means you and I are going to be spending a lot of time together next year.  And I for one would like that time to be harmonious and productive. Wouldn't you?
Okay. That's good. I just wanted to make sure.
I guess you know why you're here
Mr. M., I am running on my qualifications.  I would never need to resort to, you know, to vandalism like a, you know... Plus, my own best banner was torn down.  Did I do that too?
Were you or were you not working in the Watchdog office over the weekend?
You're a very intelligent girl, Tracy. You have many admirable qualities.  But someday maybe you'll learn that being smart and always being on top and doing whatever you need to do to get ahead, and yes, stepping on people to get there, well, there's a lot more to life than that.  And in the end, you're only cheating yourself.
Act surprised. Walk slowly to the podium.  Be modest.  Thank them for this incredible honor.
So what brings you here?
Coming to see me.  Are you trying to. . humiliate me?
Walt, we can't throw her out of the election just because we don't like her speech.  That's not what student government's about.
Okay, Jim. I understand.
Just wait outside. Tammy.
What is it. Tammy?
Here?
What do you want, Jim?
Don't say that.  You know it's not true.
But you've got a big choice right now. You can choose to be depressed about it for the rest of your life. Or you can choose to see it for what it really is: an opportunity.  I personally think you have a big future ahead of you, and I don't mean the fleeting glory of sports.
She's doing this to get back at me
It was Tammy I  That's who it was.
Who put you up to this?
Thought what?
Hell, good luck!
Yeah.  So guess what happened.  So Mr. McAllister, he --  Oh hi. Lisa.
You dumbshit!
Till 19-fucking-70.
Somebody hit you?
That's right.  Our motives are selfish, so we're cooperating.
Like I said we were friendly, not friends.
He's waiting for you to mention mention.
Did they deserve it today?
He's the opposite of you.  He's more like me.  Cold, calculating.
Come in out of the rain, Bud.
Your partner's through. Department scapegoat on the Chief's orders.  He's been billed, he'll be indicted and he'll swing.
Will you work for me?
You're perplexing to me these days, Wendell.  You're not your old, cruel self anymore.  I need proof that the extracurricular work I had planned for you remains within your grasp.
You have your extracurricular secrets, I have mine.  We'll hold a clarification session soon.  For now, I need your fearsome old habits at the Victory Motel. We're going to brace a man who may know who killed Jack Vincennes. Can I count on you?
What was that boyfriend's name?
What's through here?
Where are we going?
Somebody got wind of it, killed them all.
It wasn't the Negroes.  The Griffith Park report was a phony. And, who says the purple Merc was spotted outside the Nite Owl?
Dudley's guys.
Let's just kill them.
There are no rules!  Why the fuck are you doing this?  The Nite Owl made you.  You want to tear all that down.
Patchett's dead.  He sent you after me.  I'd say Dudley's tying up his loose ends.
What about him?
I needed a Rita Hayworth to fill out my little studio.
Officer White.  I heard you got a hard-on for wife beaters.
How 'bout I give you your balls back?
Before Meeks disappeared he was popping off about trying to move eighteen pounds of heroin.
If she was sitting here, then it's facing the wrong way.  What are these smears in the blood?
It looks like she was flailing, trying to get away.
You look like Robinson after that last LaMotta fight.  'Course LaMotta looked a lot worse.  So you're twenty-two, right?
Okay so we worked together.  It was an information exchange.  I got him first class collars and he got me good stories.  We were friends for Chrissakes!
And?
The youngest applicant by eight years.
You should stay away from a man when his blood is up.
Why not, lad?  Absolute justice?
Twelve years ago he worked a vice roust with Dick Stensland.  They arrested a Pierce Patchett on an extortion scam.  Guy ran hookers. He'd have them photographed with their johns, then double-dip for some blackmail.  Charges got dropped.  Insufficient evidence. You were supervising officer on the case and I was wondering if you remember anything about it.
You're the payoff expert.  I'm just doing my duty.
Glasses.
Yesterday that might've meant something.  Pull me off.  You'd be doing me a big favor.
It's a simple question.
We got a dead ex-cop and a girl who looks like Rita Hayworth at the Nite Owl.  Another dead ex-cop under the house of Rita's mother. It's not a good week for ex-cops.
I'll tell you what I told Officer White when he asked me about Susan's death.
Not good enough.
Miss Bracken, I'm Lieutenant Exley.
I see Bud because I want to.  I see Bud because he can't hide the warmth he has inside him.
You're tougher than Bud thinks you are.
Like recognizes like.  I'm pretty tough, myself.
Big V Jack Vincennes!  May I have this dance?
You lost me, Sid.  Who?
Stand there with your camera. I'll stop here so you get Grauman's Chinese in the backgrouns.
Sure, he just tried to throw me off the force last Christmas as a little joke.
How'd you like a little payback? Not to mention a donation to the widows and orphans fund.  Did you know Loew was a swish?
Around.
Jackie!  You got some good scoop for the Sidster?
Sid, cut the crap.  I --
What's wrong, Trash?
You didn't get my message?  It got called off.  The kid chickened out at the last minute.
Pacific Coast Bell.
No, Sergeant.  I checked twice.
Something like that.
You know, when I came out to L.A., this isn't exactly where I saw myself ending up.
I'll come straight there.
Told by whom?
Really?
That's who they are.
You're crazy.
Wait.
I don't know what that means.
If I knew, they'd be after <u>me</u>. Which they probably are right now. 'Bye.
They're spooks.
No shit.
And you won't. Now move--
I'll pay you.
And you were worried about me. That's nice, I appreciate--
I mean did you call anyone.
How do you know so much?
They can tap anything as along as it's an airwave intercept. Cellulars and pagers your kid can do.  Hard-line calls we'd pick off the relays as they were being fed into ground cables or fired up to the SATs. We'd suck in everything. All foreign, most domestic.  Domestic was my group. Druggies, radicals, loud-mouths. Anyone we wanted.
Them.
What the fuck?!
I was thinkin' about asking for my hundred and fifty grand and calling it quits.
What if we hand deliver to their homes or office?
If they couldn't do that, they'd shut down the whole system, all the relays.
What if--
What if <u>what</u>?
What if we just fucked with 'em?
I'm married.
Can you help me?
Oh...yeah, I didn't see the accident.
A police report.
That's 'cause I <u>wasn't</u> there.
I'm just trying to determine if Mr. Zavitz was involved in something more than a simple bus accident.
Bobby!
We won't suspend the civil rights of the good people.
What?
In front of Harrison's, he got hit by a bus. I knew him. The firm did some pro bono work for his organization a few years back.
What do you mean?
Robert--
Oh, please--
Is Eric in school?
That's okay.
You opened the thing?
Yeah.  I wish you could've met...
Sir?
Is this a fuckin' joke?
No, I meant I'm Presbyterian.
I mean it tastes like every other fish I've ever had. Every fish tastes the same.
Do you like fish?
Ten thousand cash. I don't know if it's Brill's prices going up or your commission.
Eat your fish.
There are reporters wanting to know about my relationship with you and how long I've worked for the mob. The <u>mob</u>, Bobby!
It's really not a good idea for me to be seen with you.
I know.
You being audited?
I've never met him?
It's not me?
You're a moron, you know that?
I went through this with an investigator this morning. If I could--
--otherwise we may have to--
Your shoe.
This is <u>bullshit</u>. Someone's mixing up a bunch of half-truths to ruin me and to ruin my case.
Who would do that?
Well until we find, you're gonna have to take a leave of absence.
Put David on it. He seems anxious to clear my name.
That's because your Union bosses <u>are</u> those Guido mother-fuckers.
He's kidding.
Where've you been?
I'm a labor lawyer. There are <u>always</u> mob ties.
It's the NSA. They're the ones doing this.
Why would the NSA--
No, listen to me. You gotta let me bring you in.
To the NSA. Make a deal. Tell 'em to stop. Tell 'em I don't have what they're after. Make a deal.
Turn yourself in.
Yeah?
I need help.
Are you still in Crystal City?
No. He said they were doing a credit check. Are you refinancing a loan?
You remember Daniel Zavitz?
What does that have to do with you?
Was Zavitz in trouble?
What the hell does it mean?
The originals?
He had help.
He's clever. He had help.
He's clever? He had help?  Oh.
Dean's with Lyle.
Jones had to flee the scene before we could locate the second body.
The fuck do you have goin' on with Sam Albert?
Puffed cheese?
Now is that clear?
You've been cheated, don't worry, we'll take it back.
What is he saying?  Come on, what did he say?
He said - be careful.
What am I looking at?
This is not very good, is it?
No.
You sew very badly.
You don't sew at all!
What?  No!
Shall we be all right?
Dance with me.
Katharine!  Oh dear God, Katharine - what are you doing here?
Please don't move me.  It hurts too much.
Why did you hate me?
Uxoriousness - that's my favorite kind of love.  Excessive love of one's wife.
Safe journey.
You too.  Good luck!
Oops!  Mustn't say International. Dirty word.  Filthy word.  His Majesty! Die Fhrer!  Il Duce.
I see.
I'll be back as quick as I can. Thirty-six hours at the outside.
Go!  Hey!  Go! Caravaggio is in terror.
Are you Hana?
I'm okay.  Look, it's a big house. We needn't disturb each other.  I can shoot a pistol!  I'll sleep in the stables.  I don't care where I sleep.  I don't sleep.
Supper. Hana calls after him.
She can take you as far as Florence.
Oh, all over.
I can't hide anymore.  I breathe like a dog.  I lose my balance.  Stealing's got harder. Caravaggio stares at the Herodotus.
Have a drink.
What?  You and Madox?  Or you and Katharine Clifton?
What did you say?
But then the Queen looked up and saw Gyges concealed in the shadows. And though she said nothing, she shuddered. The next day she sent for Gyges and challenged him.  And hearing his story, she said this -
Can't we really go home?  I can't breathe. Aren't you dying for green, anything green, or rain, wouldn't you die to feel rain on your face? It's Christmas and it's all - I don't know - if you asked me I'd go home tomorrow.  If you wanted.
Are you remembering more?
Why are you so determined to keep me alive?
There's a man downstairs.  He brought us eggs.  He might stay.
Why are people always so happy when they collide with someone from the same place?  What happened in Montreal when you passed a man in the street - did you invite him to live with you?
He needn't disturb you.
Yes?
Well then - yes.  Of course.
Could I ask you to move?  I'm sorry - but when you turn, the sheets, I can't really bear the sheets moving over me. Sorry.
They have to clear all the local roads of mines.  That's a big job. They won't stay in the house. They're putting up their tent in the garden.
There's meant to be lace in the next village - the boys are taking me.
I'll get another tin. Hana and the Patient are alone.
There's a mine here, but the others are far enough away, I think at least to give me a chance.  I have to work out which one to cut before I fall over.
So I follow the wires?
When I went to England I was amazed at what went on, the waste - I'd been taught to re-use everything, the dung from a cow to cool a radiator, a fork to fix a typewriter - India could live for a hundred years on what I saw thrown away.
I'll always go back to that church. Look at my painting.
I'll ask the Lieutenant.  But thank you.
He's sleeping.
A bomb.  At the Viaduct. She closes the door, then reappears.
Does he have to go?
A bit of one.
I thought that was for when we were very very old?
Certainly not.
I'll come with you.
I don't recall authorizing you to have a personal life.
That's great if you're a computer. In the real world that pane weighs 200 pounds. The building's 600 feet high.
He's on to something bigger.
How about if I try humility.
Believe me, if you weren't so tiresome, I'd have one for you.
I'll call an ambulance.
He says they turned the card down.
Those are my clothes.
Lose something?
Years ago, if memory serves. When does the exhibit end?
I go in alone.
Without the Mask it doesn't matter.
Certainly the most beautiful crook I've ever seen.
Yes. Yes.
I'll need the Rembrandt now.
The Mask. Where is it?
Do you know what you've done!? Do you know?
Nope. The CD instructs the computer to replace those instructions with an innocuous loan coded XJ-6.
A parting gift from the Empire.
That's where the Mask comes in.
There's no way to practice this. And no time. Besides, I've planned it all. There aren't any surprises.
Look, there's a video security system to bypass, that's the only hard part. You've done that a dozen times.
Parachute.
No way to take another day or two?
It was wrong to deceive you.
Four billion dollars.
Seen one billion, seen them all.
Not for me.
Put this on!
Always in a rush.
That's it, I sure as hell ain't no personal shopper.
Oh, it is.
I said a masked ball, not a costume party.
I cannot tell you a goddamned lie. She's selling you a pig in a poke. We better do this tonight.
It's too soon.
Suspicious, after all these years?
Doesn't look like much. How come those Commos want it so bad?
You know where my loyalties lie.
Thirty-five next generation microchips. Copper, not silicon. Value: one million each.
It's those files you asked for.
He came tearing around the corner, out of control --
An ER doctor who spends his days saving lives was the one out of control --
Hi.  Donna Irving?
Well, hell, maybe that's why you all have been so sick --
An on-site monitoring well?  That means --
The judge came up with a number.
They took some bone from my hip and put it in my neck.  I didn't have insurance, so I'm about seventeen thousand in debt right now.
... just wanna be a good mom, a nice person, a decent citizen.  Just wanna take good care of my kids.  You know?
Open and shut?  <u>Open and fucking shut</u>?
You said things would be fine, and they're not.
I was wondering -- could you tell me who I'd talk to about maybe getting an advance on my paycheck?  Just -- for the weekend.
Where's Anna?
So what's the story on this thing?  This cancer stuff?
What medical records?
The ones in the box of files.  The box of files?  The one from your office?
Don't give me that.  You're gonna get plenty rich off of this, Mr. 40 percent.  We got those PG&E fuckers by the balls here.
We've got the PG&E fuckers in Hinkley by the balls.  But nobody's getting rich unless we can pin this on the corporate PG&E fuckers in San Francisco.
Jesus.  They look like the Secret Service.
Fuck you.  Make time.  Cause I bust my ass for you.  I watch everything else in my life go straight in the toilet, for you.  And what do you do for me?  Huh?  You see the way I'm treated around here -- but have you ever stood up for me once?  Have you ever mentioned to everyone what good work I'm doing?  Have you ever bothered saying, hey, Erin doesn't get paid the most cause she has the best tits; she gets paid the most cause she's the best God damn employee I've ever had?
It's about 50 thousand per plaintiff.
And it's less than pocket change for PG&E.
Five years, maybe, for a trial.  Double that for the appeal.
The fuck I'm not.  I don't care what the doctor says --
Ho - ly - shit.
Say you'd be the luckiest son of a bitch on Earth if I didn't up and quit over all this.
But I know you're not gonna quit on me.
Well, believe it or not, I am on the prowl for some water records.
I don't know what you're talking about.
Harmful, like -- how?  What would you get?
Oh, yeah.  Definitely.  Highly toxic, highly carcinogenic.  Bad, bad stuff.
I don't know.
Hey, Ros.  Nice view, huh?
You always say that.  Then you go to work and forget you promised.
You never fall short for the work people.  I guess maybe you just love them more.
Erin.  You don't even have phone numbers for some of them.
I do.
Sure.  That's one of my numbers.  It's how many months old my little girl is.
C'mon.  I bought 'em for you, to make up for that night.
Why not?
Cause I don't even know you.
How?
Well, hell, I guess that's it, then, huh? They're scarred for life.  They're gonna start holding up 7-11's any day now.
If you got a problem with me taking care of your kids instead of getting some job, just say so.
Keep your voice down.
I'm so tired I'm about to drive off the road.  Keep me awake, willya?
Well, come to think of it, we did have a big event around here.  Beth started talking.
How long's this whole thing gonna take?
What time is it?
No, I need my car --
You're moving away?  When?
Hi, I'm Erin Brockovich.  I was just over in the library there, asking a mess of questions about -- I guess they call it epidemiology? -- and the fella there told me to find you, cause you know all about it.
Oh.  Oh.
I gotta say, Erin -- first time I saw you, I did not peg you as the kind to go off and conduct her own epidemiological study.
Asteroids don't concern me, Admiral. I want that ship, not excuses.  How long until you can have Skywalker and the others in the Millennium Falcon before me?
Will he finish what he begins?
Told you, I did.  Reckless is he ... Now things are going to worse.
Ben ... Ben ...
I can help them!
How you doing, Chewbacca?  Still wasting your time with this clown, eh?
Barks at the mention of food. Licks his lips.
Barks his concern.
Barks a doleful farewell.
I don't care.  It would've been worth it .... for Han.
... the power?
... Like we're being watched.
Looking?  Looking?  You've found someone I'd say.  Heh?  Yes!
I'm looking for a great warrior.
No, no!  I'll stay and help you find your friend.
You know the Jedi Master?
The night storms will start before you can reach the first marker.
Our situation is most precarious. We have a new enemy who could bring about our destruction.
But, if he could be turned, he would be a powerful ally.
He's checking out a meteorite that hit near him. He'll be in soon.
Transport XJ. get out of here. Go!
We're doomed.  Goodbye, Mistress Leia.  Goodbye, Captain ...
Me?  I don't know what you mean.
You probably don't.  How could you?  You're so terrified of your own emotions ...
Spare me please!  Don't tell me about the Rebellion again.  I've had it with your noble mission. All you let yourself think about is the Rebellion.  The result is you're as cold as this planet.
What was it?
Droid of some kind.  I didn't hit it that hard.  It must have had a self-destruct ....
They're moving away.
Sure.  I guess I make it difficult sometimes.
No thanks.
Loud and clear, kid.  What's up?
I've finished my circle and I haven't picked up any life read- ings.
Hi kid, you look strong enough to wrestle a Gundark.
Thanks to you.
Why you slimy, double-crossing no-good swindler ... am I glad to see you.
You're part of the mining guild then?
Luke!
The deflector shields are gone.
What??
Leia ... What would you think if I went away for a while?
I can't. It's too big.
I don't believe it.
Free your mind and return he will.
Control, control you must learn of what you see.  Not easy, not fast.
And sacrifice Han and Leia?
They're...pretending to dress.
To a lot of psychiatric small talk --
I should.  I've been doing it half my life to Humans.
His reactor's starting to overheat.
You were injected with glucose. There is no Plutoxin 7 virus. You were never going to die - at least not from anything we gave you.
He doesn't look like his picture.  I bet he's fake.
You told me he was dead.
It's so good to see you again.
He's... near.
Why should we leave? I love L.A. Where we gonna go? What's the payoff?
Where'd you get these rigs, Carjack?
Wait a minute, what are you talkin' about?
Plissken - this is Malloy. Do you have the prototype?
Relax, war hero. We took you for a ride, and you came through. Not bad for a dirtbag like you.
No way.
Listen up. I need directions. Downtown. Somebody named Hershe.
What're you doing in here?
Where's... Cuervo Jones...?
Be careful of the bald cats. They live in these buildings.
What the hell is this?
Where's the anti-toxin...?
You owe me. You left me holdin' everything back there in Cleveland.
I await the King himself. His knights are in need of training.
--That is a wild boast. You lack a knight's humility.
Move aside!
What?!
Guenevere. And a beloved friend who will betray you.
Merlin, tell me. Now that Guenevere is returned to me...
What is this place, Merlin?
--Stories... You brought me back. Your love brought me back. Back to where you are now, in the land of dreams...
Rise, Mordred.
I have come to claim what is mine, Father.
The very spear that pierced the side of Christ as he died on the cross.
I cannot offer you the land, only my love...
I will muster a great force of knights, and I will return to fight for what is mine.
He is the mightiest and fairest of knights.
He must stay for the feasting days of our wedding, and tell his deeds himself.
Sir Gahalt, answer the Queen.
The Queen will be in my charge till a champion steps forward to fight on her behalf.
Why can't you be my champion?
If I am your judge, I cannot be your champion. When I act as your King, I cannot be your husband.
Forgive me, my wife, if you can. I was not born to live a man's life, but to be the stuff of future memory. The fellowship was a brief beginning, a fair time that cannot be forgotten; and because it will not be forgotten, that fair time may come again. Now once more I must ride with my knights to defend what was, and the dream of what could be.
Why didn't he kill us?
Listen, boy, it's more than twenty days from here.
I have found you. The Queen. An apple. Tomorrow. Sir Gawain...
They do.
You are truly magnificent!
C'mon I can read for Christ sake.
That's right Mike. But he's finished and came back around three ot four months ago, He's in Woodstock now.
And I don't care what you call it! I'm not putting her away!
Hello?
Your kidding me. What is it a big party or something?
Just five or six people.
Didn't who tell me?
What's Burke got to do with it?
A stimulant.
Stimulant? She's higher than a kite right now!
Have you ever known your daughter to swear and use obscenities?
Wait a minute. What are you talking about?
So, how'd a shrink ever get to be a priest?
No.
No I wouldn't. But I'd try to persuade him to turn himself in.
If a person was possessed by a demon of some kind, how do you go about getting an exorcism?
Oh yeah, since when?
Like what?
Did you know my mother died recently?
Oh............
Who's Captain Howdy?
What are we gonna do on your birthday, isn't that nice it's on a Sunday this year, what can we do?
Your not gonna marry him are you?
But you like him.
Well I heard differently.
Oh you did. What did you hear?
I don't know, I just thought.
People get tired.
Where'd you get the money for the Chivas Regal? The poor box?
Goodnight Dims.
What's playing.
That's much to vulgar a display of power Karras.
Ydob eht ni mraw si ti! Uoy ees I! Tseirp a si eh! Emit su evig! Nirrem! Nirrem!
Uoy era ohw.
Okay
You are not happy. Tell me what is the matter?
No.
Do you want to hear the background of the case, first?
We may ask what is relevant, but anything beyond that is dangerous. He is a liar, the demon is a liar. He will lie to confuse us. But he will also mix lies with the truth to attack us. The attack is psychological , Damien. And powerful. So don't listen, remember that, do not listen.
And let my cry come unto thee.
You've seen him. You're also familiar with how last week he died?
Unlikely.
You think the killer and the desecrator are the same?
No, I mentioned it only in passing.
Very much.
The Dominicans. Go pick on them.
If he talks to me, I think he'll leave you. Do you want him to leave you?
You're not going to drive!
Little slow tonight.
Where are our kids? Has he got one of them in there?
What do you say we go for a walk, pal.
You want me to show up late a few nights?
Huh?
Listen ... why don't you come out to the house this weekend.  Say hello to the kids. They've grown.
They tried to electrocute me, Frank.
It was an accident.
She didn't know what she was doing. You're too sensitive.
Why the interest?
What about that waitress at the Ambassador?
I don't gotta go.
Terrific.
I don't know what you mean.
A gust of wind killed him.
Talk.
If you'd like to assume more of the financial responsibilities, I'd be glad --
I've tried to do well by you, Jack. By both of us.
I suppose we can bring it down a little.
All right, all right.  I'm a little tense.
Make it collect.
We do.  She's got hers, we've got ours. Hey. Wash and Dries.
I thought we all had separate rooms.
You leaving that on?
Christ, can't you hear it?
What's it look like I'm doing? I'm tuning a goddamn piano.
Really.
What the hell are these?
What?
What do you mean?
You know, my brother and I have been playing together, gosh, I don't know.  Jack?
No.
I told you, Jack.  It's a telethon. No one gets a cent.
Bought it on the way over.  Clean as a nun.
You know, that night, I ... It just all came up.
The audience was a little off tonight.
So she's got a few sniffles.
You got no right springing this on me, Frankie. It's unethical.
Moran.  Monica.  The whole thing. It's my stage name.  My real name's Blanche.
And if she asks what it's about, don't tell her. She's opposed to my career.
Candy Man.'  Is that all right?
So if I'm so 'late how come you're still here?
Hey, it's legit.  Strictly dinner and dance.
So?
No. We are not supposed to be backing you up.
Is there a language problem here?  Your dress. For tonight.  Where is it?
A seven.
Hey, pal.  I don't know about you, but where I come from there's a little girl's room and a little boy's room and the little boys don't go where the little girls go.
Nine.
Right.
For Christ sake, I said it, I didn't do it.  Besides, I don't think they were too offended, do you?
We are not a saloon act.  We do not take tips from dirty old men.
Well, well.  Ho, ho, ho.  You moonlighting at Macy's, Frank?
You two could play checkers.
You play all these places?
Virgins?
Go ahead.
Hey, we're connected.
People.' You think Streisand, right? Hot that night.  Chills. Through the whole audience.  I could hardly play.
Uh, well, I love you, too, Jack.  So. Susie.  How 'bout it.
Huh?
What're you talking about?  They love it.
Whatcha doin' over there?
Gotta go.
Don't worry about it.
Baker.
All right.  Hold on.
It went well tonight.
Frank works hard.
Yes, well, it's probably best. No sense bringing someone else in.
You never sang before?
His kid's sick.
Oh, sorry.  With the light always on, it's hard to tell.
Nothing.
I'm not upset.
It means you wouldn't know good if it came up and fucked you.
I have to make him some chili. Okay?
Ma didn't want it around.  After.
Oh. Hi.  Sorry.
Coffee?
Did you break a cup, Jack?
How'd the show go?
Fine work, Jon.
He's lying.
Jon, he's hooked up to a full-spectrum polygraph. No one has ever beaten --
Uh-oh, somebody's in trouble.
Pollux ...
You porked his wife the day he was arrested.  How could you forget that?
A few blanks?  Like what?
Jon ... we just remember how it used to be.  You staying for a while or is this just a piss-stop?
I can't tell you ... except only I can do it.
Okay, you're having an emotional crisis.  You need to seek the help of a trained --
I know Lazarro -- the first person she'd call is "me." We can't take the chance of tipping Castor off.
Would it?
She doesn't know -- and she never will.
-- Castor?
I don't know.  How long before it kills us?
Clarissa left those here.
There's my little darling.  The night wouldn't be complete without you.
Oh -- Commander.  I didn't see you ...
Kim?
You've got someone in your office.
Where should I be?  Where's everyone else?
What?
Don't worry, nobody knows I'm inside.  Check it out.  Remember that fat fuck agent who roughed us up in Thailand?  He's being treated for bone cancer at the V.A.  Thanks to the miracle of NSA grid-technology ...  -- Ooops!  His radiation does just quadrupled.
I'm just having some fun.
We gut the organization -- and rebuild it with more reliable friends.
You'd have to start immediately.
I think -- you're trying to get me drunk.
So -- how long will you be gone this time?
I'm replacing Lazarro. Nice, safe desk job -- just like you wanted.
Kate Reynolds...
No?!  You almost married this woman.  Aren't you even curious what she wants?
Why Jack?
Mr. Mintz.
I was a sales associate, at E.F. Hutton.
Mind if I ask what kind of sales you did last year? Ballpark...
I dont think youre hearing me.
But I think I like you better this way...
They did a pretty good job.
On a case by case basis...
You promise not to kidnap me and my brother and implant stuff in our brains?
Five thirty.  Okay.
Got it.  Good tip.
Trouble at work?
She wants to have an affair with me.
She said that?
It wouldnt really be cheating...  Its complicated.
Im telling you, those rules dont apply to me, Arn.
Wait a second...  Jack...Jack...
Yes...Jack Campbell...
Wheres my car?!  Wheres my Ferrari!?
There's no way I was gonna die in that deli...  Let's just say I've been on a lucky streak lately.
What do you want to carry that gun around for, anyway? You're just gonna do something you'll regret...
Me?
You still think this is about me, don't you?
You?  What about me?  Im working hard for you here, Jack.  On Christmas too!  Now you did a good thing last night, intervening that way.  I was moved...
Why not?
Because you got to figure it out for yourself.  Are you listening to me?
Need a nurse?
Mr. Mintz?  I dont think so...buildings closed pal.  Youll have to come back tomorrow.
Uh huh...
Right, for us. But...Im afraid that if you get on that plane...
I can't seem to let go of you...
What kind of man does that!?
Because thats where I live.
Telling my mother she doesnt have to stay with the kids.
Christ...  Where the hell is the bathroom?
But its twenty degrees outside...
...my feet are hurtin...
Uh...that babys crying...
Do what?
Really.
I think it worked out okay, dont you?
We were young...  Remember that little place on Charles Street we used to go to?
You actually forgot our anniversary.
You are so not off the hook yet, slick.
But you always seem so certain.
I cant believe you want to move back into the city.  I thought the reason we left was because we didnt want to raise the kids here?
You look great.
I'm sorry...
Jesus, Jack...
Mrs. Peterson.
I need you, tiger..
Did you really mean what you said about Tuscany?
I want to see you again.
I'd like that, too.
It's Christmas Eve, Jack.
Hey, kind of under a little pressure here.
We got what we wanted.  That's <u>enough</u>.
They crashed it into a wall.  A flight <i>simulator</i>.
This is your dream, Reed.  You should be the one up there.
How long was I out?
Yeah, you and Debbie and perfect --
I'm sorry, did that cosmic-bath loosen your screws?
Glad "nothing" could take you away from your work.
Time for <u>your</u> lesson, Vic.  Chem 101: what happens when you <u>supercool</u> hot metal...?  Ben...
Let's see: you got Victor, stud of the year, more coin than God?  Or Reed, the world's dumbest smart guy worth less than a postage stamp.  Hmmm, it's a toss-up.
Where...where am I?
It's easy for you to be patient.
What?
Now what is up with <i>that</i>?
I mean, you feel a little feverish.
Our numbers are through the roof.  The IPO's tracking at fifty, sixty a share.  The bank's five times oversubscribed --
But dreams don't pay the bills, do they?  Same old Reed, the hopeless optimist. Still reaching for the stars, with the world on your back.
Got it.  So take a walk, Ben...I'm going to borrow Susan for a second.
Not until Ben is back inside!
Ben did this.
Didn't go as <u>planned</u>?  It was a <u>catastrophe</u>.  You ruined the lives of four people --
You're, you've, I mean, how have you bee--
Those solar winds are flaring, but I factored them into my coordinates and --
That's good.  That's uh...good.
Are you kidding?
What are you doing?
And reverse the mutations --
Reed.  How close are we to a cure?
It's been a good two years, Victor... The company's accomplished so much.
Oh, I think you already have.
If you're trying to cheer me up you're doing a helluva job --
Reed's gonna fix me up --
Grant's uniquely qualified for this mission. He's a Communications Expert and was a Frogman during the War. Besides, he brought Benes into this country, and the fewer people who know about him, the better. At any rate, you'll find Grant invaluable, should anything go wrong once you're under way.  Okay, Don.
That can't be -- there's no direct connection between the two --
<Cardiac Red Alert> we're stopping the Heart.
What're you getting at?
The Other Side got to him.
Right, sir.
If the Other Side ever gets hold of a thing like that...
You mean <I'm> going along?
This is Dr. Duval, our Head Surgeon.
Yes, we'd like to get moving.
I can't imagine how it possibly could have come loose. I distinctly recall fastening it with all four bolts --
Doctor...
Never saw <that>. Not even under an electron-mrcroscope.
No need to get up --
Depends on which end of the telescope you look through.
Doctor, what's wrong?
I can't breathe!... I've got to get out!
Dr. Duval, you are not going through with this! I absolutely forbid it! I'm responsible for the lives of everyone here! I will not allow you or anyone else to leave this ship!
The Medieval Philosophers were right... <Man> is the center of the Universe... We stand in the middle of Infinity, between Outer and Inner Space. And there's no limit to either.
They know they failed to kill Benes. Security thinks they'll try again, first chance they get. We're afraid of medical sabotage -- or surgical assassination.
That's just dandy. We can't go forward -- and we can't go back.
Yes -- with all that pressure, and suction within --
His Pleura's in fine condition. It should be clear sailing through this area.
If it's no military secret, how can a sub run on a microscopic particle?
Uh -- what?
What is it, Skipper?
Well, that takes care of the valve. It was probably caused by that electric shock.
We could never fight that current it's physically impossible.
There seems to be something wrong with the Escape Hatch...
Ophhem ma fuchem gaphe!
I got your goddamn money, you little punk. Now where's my daughter?
No Jean, no money!
You're required to display temporary tags, either in the plate area or taped inside the back window.
Where is Pancakes Hause?
What?
Unguent.
Huh?  Grimsurd looks at his thumb.
Shut the fuck up or I'll throw you back in the trunk, you know.
She started shrieking, you know.
Well, okay, it's -
Yah, well, that was a mix-up, then.
Blood has been shed. We've incurred risks, Jerry. I'm coming into town tomorrow. Have the money ready.
Now we had a deal here! A deal's a deal!
We sat here right in this room and went over this and over this!
I sat right here and said I didn't want no TruCoat!
One hunnert's the best we can do here.
This'll be our first. We've been waiting a long time.
Oh, yah, I know that!
They can really take over, that's for sure.
Oh, now he's adorable.
Uh-huh.
The numbers y'asked for, calls made from the lobby pay phone at the Blue Ox. Two to Minneapolis that night.
First one's a trucking company, second one's a private residence.  A Shep Proudfoot.
Uh-huh... A what?
Where you girls from?
I dunno. Just funny-looking.
Okay. We'll get the money together. Don't worry about it, Jerry. Now, d'you want anyone at home, with you, until they call?
No, I - they don't want - they're just s'posed to be dealin' with me, they were real clear.
So you're goin' to the Gophers on Sunday?
You bet.
It's okay, Scotty. They're not gonna want to hurt her any.  These men, they just want money, see.
Yeah, but -
Naw, I... Executive Sales Manager.
Well, you can help me. My name's Marge Gunderson -
I know, but - well, how do you establish that, sir? Are the cars, uh, counted daily or what kind of -
... I'm sorry, sir?
Pretty good, Mr. Lundegaard.  You're damned hard to get on the phone.
That's for sure. Now, I just need, on these last, these financing documents you sent us, I can't read the serial numbers of the vehicles on here, so I -
But I already got the, it's okay, the loans are in place, I already got the, the what, the -
Yah, well, they exist all right.
Yah, Shep Proudfoot said -
Are you calling Stan?
...Who they playin'?
No kiddin'! I'd need the cash pretty quick there. In order to close the deal.
... Stan, I'm thinkin' we should offer 'em half a million.
The heck d'ya mean?
Yah, well, see, I did that, and I haven't been able to get 'em, so I thought you maybe'd know an alternate number or what have ya.
Yah.
That's okay, hon. I gotta run.
...I'll fix ya some eggs.
Yah, yah, course I remember.  How are ya? What time is it?
Okay, ya know. Okay.
Oh, yah, a long time ago.
No, just so I can see ya, ya know. Don't have to turn my neck.
No, no, that's fine.
Yah?
Lundegaard's father-in-law's accountant.
Gustafson's accountant.
Yah.
Aw, hon, you're better'n them.
They're good, Norm, but you're better'n them.
What the heck, Jerry, if I wanted bank interest on seven hunnert'n fifty thousand I'd go to Midwest Federal. Talk to Bill Diehl.
The first rule of Project --
We're still men.
...using steroids.  I was a juicer. Diabonol, then, Wisterol -- it's for racehorses, for Christsake.  Now I'm bankrupt, divorced, my two grown kids won't return my calls...
You are?!
That's a fucking great, man!  Fucking great! Congratulations.
You need to make these your primary "action items."
Is that your blood?
The dynamite...
Maybe I died already.  Look at my face.
A year?  How'd you manage that?
It becomes an addiction.
We'll split up the week.  You can have lymphoma, tuberculosis and --
I think testicular cancer should be no contest.
You're kidding.
You're such a nutcase, I can't even begin to keep up.
I don't know ...
No, thanks.
Well, that's a relief.  Thank you.
I could check your prostate.
Uh ... nah.
I don't understand.  Why does a weak person have to go out and find a strong person... to hang onto?
That... sawing and hammering.
... A person.
Why would you ask if it's a guy or a girl?!
Say my name!  What's my name!?
Your whacked-out, bald freaks hit me with a fucking broom.  I thought they were going to break my arm.
I don't want to hear anything you've got to say.
Absolutely, you have every right.  I need you to do me a favor.
Two sides?  You're Dr. Jeckle and Mr. Jackass.
I'm trying to tell you -- and this is where you have to trust me -- but, I think your life might be in real danger.
What happened... ?
Who did this to you?
I just called a second ago.  There was no answer.  I'm at a payphone.
Is this a test, sir?
You were in here last Thursday night.
If I did have a tumor, I'd name it Marla.  Marla...the little scratch on the roof of your mouth that would heal if only you could stop tonguing it, but you can't.
This is how I met --
You know why they have oxygen masks on planes?
And, now it's gone.
Do what you like.
Yeah.
We're on our third pitcher of beer. Just ask me.
Why don't you cut the shit and ask if you can stay at my place?
Yes, you can.
One-forty-eighth of a second.  That's how long it's up there.
No one really knows that they've seen it. But they did.
Where do you want it?  In the face?
We've crossed the threshold.  You want to call it off?
If you could fight anyone... one on one, whoever you wanted, who would you fight?
What?
Marla doesn't need a lover.  She needs a case worker.
She'd invaded my support groups, now she's invading my home.
"The liberator who destroyed my property has re-aligned my paradigm of perception."
I... I think I understand.  I think I get it...
You quit?
Six months advance pay.  Six months!
Why wasn't I told about "Project Mayhem?"
What do you want?  A statement of purpose... ?
What?
"Too young?"
If the applicant waits at the door for three days without food, shelter or encouragement, then he can enter and begin training.
This isn't possible...
What... what are you saying?
What about them?  They're lunatics.
I quit.
Paraffin.
Why can't I get rid of you?  Why can't I just wish you away?
From now on, we'll share Marla. We've been spending too much time apart...
Who is this?
Maintenance.
No!  Wrong!  This man's name is Robert Paulson.
Who told you motherfuckers you could use my place?
Really?
It's free to all.
The second one just dies.  A 16 year old kid.
I can practically taste the water in my throat.  And something else.  The smell of flowers...
No!  It can't be.
Should we knock?
Make sure all these people will be at the meeting tonight.
The only reason he was on Route 18 was because he own the lottery and had to collect the winnings.
Carter.
Yeah.  Who does he think he is? Knight Rider?
Dano, shouldn't we stop and help your mother?
Look, you weren't there.  It was weird.  She knew that log truck was gonna cause an accident, she knew.  Never mind.
What do you mean "grand theft auto?" This is insane.
Take a guess.
First I'm stuck with Jury Duty, now this nonsense.
THAT's the truck that's going to kill everyone!
Tell me again how it started.
Like I said, it was like I was there. I remember everything.  The sounds of the crashes, the smells, the look on Shaina's face...
I tried calling last night but your father --
Pigeons... It's a sign!  If Clear's right about the order, then Nora and Tim are going to be attacked by Pigeons!
This is cheery.
How are we going to find her?  There must be thousands of white vans in this state.
I know this is the first time we've been apart since.  But everything's gonna be okay.
I'm sorry.  I'm just so happy that you're safe.
You're all certifiable, you know that?  I can't believe I've been listening to this crap.  Come on, Tim, let's go outside.
How would I know? You think I'm some sort of...
This place?!
How many died on Flight 180?  From our group?
No, but it might as well be the same thing. This was a message... from someone, or something... hinting... at the design.
My intervention in the death of 180 survivors will cheat the design.
Man, that is one George Michael notch from being gay.
And don't pass on the right.
Billy! I'm gettin' a vision!  You're the next one...
Hey, man, why'd you say that?!
Please tell me I'm gonna get to see the Jets win the Super Bowl.
It broke!
May as well go out under my own free will, right?
No.
Wow!
Read you.
Batteries not included.
Cocktail party.  Uh huh, right.  Let's saddle up.
You wanna know why I stood up for this show?
That's a real good reason to wind up in 'Nam.
What's this stuff on the rice?
What's she saying?
She likes you.  Says you're dinky- dau.
Can't tell.  Pretty tall.  He's real scrunched up in that thing.
Are they going to torture us?
Yes.
You really got a Masters Degree?
Where's Nguyen now?  What city?
Christ.  How'd you get here?
Carefully.  Don't want to get shot by you.  Bad karma.  Anyway, you need me.
I do?
Alternate LZ Zulu Sierra at 0500. It says "May have heat.  Don't be late.  All our love."
That's an order.
Classic special forces op... hit fast... in and out.  Two men.  Two days.
This operation is in two phases. Recon and rescue.  You are phase one.  Your two-man team will probe the site, confirm the presence of American POWs, if any, make photographic and tactical observations, then proceed to the extraction point without engaging the enemy.
He's giving them a run for their money.  Says here they've got two Hueys from Danang.  I didn't know those dinks had Hueys.
Sir, there's something else... a TRANSAT relay.  Just came through.
Christ almighty.
You think they'll find any?
I know.
I know...
This mission was a scam from the word go?
Am I out of here?
That depends on you.  Christ, look at you.  I give you this easy duty until I can get you an assignment... all you have to do is eat ice cream and watch soap operas... and you have to make it Rambo's last stand.
Those men are all dead.
Congressional Medal of Honor.
Keep it clean, Rambo, or I'll nail your hide to the shed.
You know, I think I... ordered some just the other day.
That's not true...You gotta ease up... Conversations have a life of their own. You gotta just go with it...We're having a lovely conversation.
Oh, no..I have to get home...
I... I stayed at a friend's.  Listen, I --
I don't know her last name... I'll be off in a second.
The moron?
Don't treat me like I'm stupid.  It pisses me off.
Well, what the hell does that mean?
It's so great to see you like this, honey... I can't tell you.
"I'm an incredible woman?"  What is this, a death sentence?
... I'd like to focus on my career - - now than I can, now that everything's all right... Parry's taken care of... and... Like I said, I feel like I know a lot more now and I don't...
I didn't know.  I just said all I want is some time.
What if I was a relative?
A real nice place I know... Ah...can't get there! Not tonight.
It was a crime.
You shouldn't hang around this neighborhood.
Fine.  I'll say no.
I'll remember that the next time you get excited by drawing pubic hairs on raisin bran.  Want some?
Well there....  What's the difference?
So how do we do this?
Where am I?
They said you're The One.
Uhh... I'm drawing a blank.
A quest?
I know!  You can't imagine how surprised I was.  Who would think you could find anything divine on the Upper East Side.
What's her name?
Here's another twenty. Will that do?  I mean, what's it going to take!
Look, you're only sort of insane, really. People like you can lead semi-normal lives. You could get a job...
I don't need a job. I have a quest.
Will you shut-up!!!
That's why the Little People sent you. Just <u>like</u> magic.
Are there any questions?
Happily married, probably.
Bad example. Just trust me. A woman who loves you keeps you going...gives you strength... Makes you feel like you can do anything...
No. Nothing bad's going to happen. Anne'll be there. I'll be there. Nothing bad will happen.
Parry, it's Lydia Sinclair - our membership winner.
It's just a bum...You know, there's enough in here for the two of you.
Are you all right?
How about... Zbiegnew Speizak's "The Purple Bread," an intensely portrayed tale of love and envy set against the sweeping background of a Polish bakery.  In subtitles.
Oh... You mean you don't want to.
You're not going to play it again.
Now quit, Bobby. You said you're goin' a help me pick a song.
Cerveza.
You know what, you are never satisfied.
That was damn good, wad'n it? I finally did it...
I'm going on over there...
You're goin' a find me dead one time.
You like it?
If you can't do what I ask, Ray, use that money to go back home, then.
No. We have tomatoes.
But I can't have any. Is that what you mean?
Wait, I've made up my mind. I want a plain omelette, forget the tomatoes, don't put potatoes on the plate, and give me a side of wheat toast and a cup of coffee.
You want me to hold the chicken.
Now don't...
Well, I don't mean to.  Here's your tea, Tita.
No.
Waldnit von Schnechter. Prewar.
Who's Van Oost?
Catherine -- she's a pianist. She's working with Carl.
Crashes into a Jeep and totals his neck.  That's Carl...
Yeah, me, too...
Tita, I've got to go...
No, I don't.  You should've left a long time ago.
With applesauce?
You're leaving?
Yeah. I said a week, and I've overstayed myself...
What have you been doing since then?
Nothing? Then it must be very boring for you here.
I mean, how could you not play anymore? That's so strange to me...
It doesn't matter. It was the feeling I was affected by.
None.
Catherine...
I'm not faking anything. I'm looking for some bath oil...
I don't find your language that charming.
Is he?
Come on, get moving, dammit!!
Oh, my, "a summit conference." I wonder where I was, polishing silver behind the coal bin.
Pardon me?
Well, she was.
If you want to call it that.
For once in your life have some 	respect for me, don't even curse at me or nothin'.
What are you doin' here?
You look good.
Why?
Natasha, Maria, Tina-
Oh man, what we gotta leave ar' own neighborhood for?
How does he look up close?
You gonna talk to him?
Now salsa, you know how to dance salsa?
You here to see somebody?
My friend told me she lived around here.
What?
Jus' from around the way.
God I admire you.
Never heard of him. Thanks anyway.
What?
Wonder who his supplier is.
Creasy, how old are you?
Hey you're really nuts.
Full name.
I'm about to break that beach wide open, and I don't need some pennyante Woodward and Bernstein getting in the way of my men.
Thanks for coming down to see us.
What the hell are you doing here?
But not right next to each other. I thought that's what you meant.
No books. No elephants either. No really good elephant books.
Is she ever. I've got some stories....
Just relax.
For sure?
I think Id rather have drugs.
Affirmative.
You gonna nail the chief?
Oh, I'll help, Fletch. I'm a slave to that sonofabitch. He busted me, third offense, gave me a choice: Work for him or do fifteen long. All I get out of this is free snort.
Have you got a make-shift plywood pillory? Heh Heh, just kidding.
Because I trust you, Alan. By the way, the name's Fletcher. I.M. Fletcher. I write a newspaper column under the name Jane Doe.
Regulations, Mr. Stanwyk. And you and your wife, named....
Trust me, sir. It's a comprehensive policy.
I really creamed the sonofabitch, didn't I?
So why pick me?
I want it done Thursday evening, around eight PM. My wife will be off to the club for a committee meeting. It's the staff's night off.  These will be open.
So it looks like a burglary attempt. You catch me. I get the gun, and shoot you.
They serve dinner on the flight?
It'll be a first class-ticket. I'm sure you'll enjoy the ride. I would recommend staying down there at least a year, Mr. Nugent.
That's right.
You sure got the hard part.
W-Y-K no 'c.' I'll be down in a minute.
Nothing on Gail Stanwyk, nothing on Jim Swarthout. But I did ---
I just thought... sure.  Sally Ann Cavanaugh.
I'm sorry?
Mind if I keep practicing? I need to work on my ground stroke a little.
I'm such a heel. How'd you guess?
I saved his life during the war.
Utah is not exactly a cure for boredom.
Good point.
A four hundred dollar lunch tab!
I'll cover it. You have any other surprises?
He's a bad guy, Mrs. Stanwyk. Gail. I think he's involved in something very big and very bad.
Wait a second. What am I supposed to do for twenty-four hours?
I checked. There was no divorce.
They just left, sir.
Great. I'll have a Bloody Mary and a steak sandwich.
No thanks, I'll do it. Give yourself twenty dollars. Underhill.
Muchas gracias.
What?
I spoke to her last week. She didn't say anything.
What did you want under the bed?
Fletch.
Irwin...
Irwin, professional journalism time, now. Go back to the goddamn beach and finish the goddamn story!
Well, there we're in a gray area.
Cool your tool, Frank, I need a little more time. I think I'm really on to something here.
Just give me a hint, all right?
I have some ideas.
He threw me in a cell, took a gun and a knife and threatened to kill me right there if I didn't promise to give up the story.
You know, I've had it up to here with your bullshit. I need a story from you by tomorrow.
And, I'm sorry, who are you again?
Apparently, someone of your acquaintance has charged the most extraordinary lunch to my bill.
Mrs. Stanwyk!
I said, I ain't got you...
Some fag.  Charged me up the ass.
Actually, you may take it all now.
Oh... I have some questions.
Who?
So you know about Johnny Crunch and myself.
So you...
We invested in these factories. In Vancouver.
G'day, they say it's worth three grand...
I wish I knew.  You did good work...
Contacts.
Ah, an obvious choice.
Got those Vomit invites here...
Friends?  You didn't tell me that.
Reality-reality-reality -- Outrageous building, huh?
Hello, Mr. Tongue!  What a perv.
Well what is it?  I'm not Kreskin.
Hey, you, get off my cloud.  I'm talking to my friend.  1962 Fender Stratocaster with original humbucking pick-ups, maple neck, strung upside down for a left- handed motherfucking genius... Jimi Hendrix.
This ain't no social call.  One hundred bucks.  To find my father.
Holy Colonel Mustard.  Gosh, you didn't mention the big clue... Kid, I can't take your money.
I'm sorry...
And hey, I appreciate it...
Where's my father?  Have you even looked?
Nice tie, Lt. Anus, sir.
I was about to say he looked like shit, but hey, sure, he looked like you.
Polo.
I'm off it!
I knew your father.  He was quite...
It doesn't have to be like this?
I just gave up smoking.  A last drink?
Man, Julian, that accident took away more than your hearing.
I don't believe it.  Getting paid to be the asshole you always were.
Fucking amazing, huh?  Chevy Nova, you Bensonhurst shit!  Still in La-la land.  Look at us, two rock 'n' roll dicks.  Unfortunately, only one of us is a detective.
So...
Doyle.
How come there's nothing out there? That stuff is all milk.
Doesn't register.
Well try, okay?
Ever pick your feet in Poughkeepsie?
What?
Man, I'm clean.
Tu sais j'ai rflchi longuement  ton cadeau pour le voyage.  Je l'ai choisi moi-mme.  Tiens.
Une erreur!  C'est gnial.  C'est une vedette  la tlvision.  Il peut aller partout sans tre souponn... En plus il a besoin de fric.
J'ai pas confiance en lui.
Most New Yorkers never notice it - most Americans have never heard of it.
Look how gracefully they conceived that arch.  Like a bowstring.  It was built from both ends.  With no support in the middle.  Beautiful.
I got no music!
There may be two... no, three who could fit it.
And a Mr. Michael Lowenstein, I don't know what he does.
I got this little chick I'm tryin' to hit on.  She's about 20, 21... I take her to Jilly's last night and she's tellin' me about how she wants to settle down one day, get married... I says, "Hey, this is 1971, baby, I'm just a dirty old man lookin' to score with some pussy."
Yeah.  In the late innings.  Ya look like a night's sleep wouldn't kill ya.
No, you?
Whatta you say we wait and give him a tail?
Monica?  Who's Monica?
I think we oughta burn him on suspicion.
So whatta you want a badge?  It's your first major league game Sal. One thing I learned, move calmly, move cautiously.  You'll never be sorry.
You know what I'm saying.
No, I don't.
Let me tell you what I know, Daryl.  You went to Saint Xavier with Mary.  You lived five blocks from her.  You liked her.  But she ain't interested.  That must've hurt, huh?
Oh, my God!  What is that?!  Why you showing me this shit!?  JESUS!  JESUS! Get those away from me!
They around?
Oh, man.  Hope it ain't like this in Baltimore tomorrow.
You didn't marry Donna Reed.
I'm off.
I'm serious.
Okay, I'm on it.  Hey.
He's not gonna stop, Satch.  He's gonna keep on...
The next batter, Clendenon, hits one outta the park.
Don't be scared.  This time I'm right behind you if you fall.
Uh, hello?
I thought these things were for talkin' around the world.
Hello?
I been Q-ing you all night.  How the hell did you do it?
Uh huh...
What'd you say your name was?
Is this some kind of joke?  Gordo is that you?  Are you fucking with me?
What?
Thirty-five?  That would make it...
1998...?  This is wrong.  Who are you? Why are you doing this?
I lost you.
I never knew you, Dad.
We're doing all right, Dad.  We're doing good.
What, Johnny?  What is it?
Right here, Chief.  Sorry I lost you last night.  Damn thing keeps cutting out.
Something happened, something...
She's not here.
I don't know, John.  I'm a fire fighter. This is...this is different.
I'll be damned.
Coupla days ago they dug up a body in Washington Heights - Mary Finelli.  Girl disappeared in '68.  Turns out she was his first kill.  Which means he probably knew her.  Most serials know their first victim.  I'm gonna do some checking - see if I can put any of this together...
John, say hello to my wife...Julia.
You all right?
In my pocket.
What are you doing here, Satch?  You off today?
Sull!  What the hell!
My father didn't die in a fire?
Huh?
This is the Space Cowboy.  I'm an intergalactic traveler from the Federation planet earth.
So how are things at the hospital?
Fine.  You know Dr. Schwartz retired last month?
You used to be on the job?
Yeah, long time ago.  I know you?
A hot shot, huh?
Dammit Shelly!  Why do you always have to be such an asshole!
So what would a weekend in the country be without sex?
What're you doin'?
I can't find the bong anywhere. Can't you remember where you dropped it?
I can't even remember what day it is, man.
What's this?
I don't know.
You know, I'm not sure I could live anywhere else.  The nights are always so peaceful and quiet.
I don't know.  I don't see you for months on end, and when I do, you put this wall between us.  How do I break through?
What are we gonna do?
Are they following us?
Yes.
You've just learned a valuable lesson.  A beautiful girl like you should never go out in the dark alone.
You don't "have to."
You don't to say it.  I can tell.
Who's Horace?
....with a woman's touch.
Ahh, nothing.
Never should've let her play.
What it is?
...And I said, shut up!
Yeah, hi.  Listen, I've got to talk to your dad.  About Jason. I've got a plan.  I need to buy some things first but mainly need help to...
So what are ya drawin'?
There...Ya happy?
Wait a minute. I just...
Lake Forest Green?
Nancy.
...Good.  So no more bad dreams can come around here, huh?
Why?
He didn't say anything?
Mr. Duke, how can you claim that Jason Voorhees is not truly dead?
So let's talk.
You have to...save...Jessica... Save Jessica and save the...
I'm here.
Jason Voorhees is dead.
What do you want?
You need to leave.
Steven buggin' you?
Okay.  So how is Jessica?  You talked to her lately?
Hello...
I'm just too old for going steady, Josh.
For a good reason.
Okay.
The truth?  That Josh, a man I've trusted with my own life on more than one occasion -- let me see if I've got the order right here -- tried to rape Diana...got the back of his head blown off...took a poker through the gut...fell through a plate glass window and then magically disappeared into the night.
Look, I know I treated her bad --
No -- she left me!  After her miscarriage, I --
I mean really never.
She's a waitress at Joey B's but she needs some extra cash.  Ward's the pimp.
I hear the crew members are cute guys in their twenties.
Really?
Right.
Where did you get that alcohol?
You have no right...
And neither do you. It's up to Rennie to decide what she wants to do.
I'm her legal guardian, not you or anybody else, and I alone know what's best for her. End of discussion.
She's fine, Charles. Take it easy...
Everything okay?
Really?
Yeah...a lot.
The Captain and Chief Engineer... they've been...they're dead.
Hi, Sean.
I heard you weren't coming.
I think so. But we have to lower the anchors so we don't drift any further...
I didn't mean for you to go!
Rennie...??
I used to drive a taxi.
You are going where?
Alla puttanesca.
A lovely piece of theater. Small but important.
Suffering. You exude a person who sits in a small dark apartment eating soft white bread.
Tonight you find out what it means to suffer.
Steven Schwimmer. I memorized every word of this review.
What?
This could be it.
This could be it.
Let's work on it.
This could be it.
This could be it.
You know about Adele.
Peter Redmond. They found out why he can't remember his lines. There's something living in his brain. A parasite he picked up in Borneo, doing the movie.
What?
I used to tell myself. Talent is more erotic when it's wasted. Will I see you tonight?
It's all worked out. They'll lose tonight. Then they'll lose tomorrow. I see it with stunning clarity.
It's your best play, Nicky.
Do you want to get some coffee?
Because they get outstanding settlements. And Mother is determined that this time there's no turning back.
Rogan, Laurel. You also have a Rogan, Lillian. She won't need it. Sell it.
You have to tell me what you thought of the play.
Deception isn't something I personally consider sexy.
Two-all after six.
You know why, don't you? Because I am patient, chain-smoking Lillian.
You smoked because I smoked. We were falling in love, remember? I used to see certain movies only because you had seen them. I wanted to see what you saw.
I went because you went. You smoked because I smoked.
It violates so many trusts.
It was an animal thing. No real intimacy.
Great game. Red Sox are winning.
It's one thing for kids. You get older, you Nhave other things.
Where's your elastic brace?
You're suppose to wear it when your back gives you trouble.
Everybody else does. Why not you?
Go on, tell him. Tell the truth. Tell him how you feel, shooting a piece of hot metal in somebody's flesh who was once a child, who was once the same age as this boy. Somebody's flesh who was innocent once.
Because God loves a winner.
And you're not saying that because of the gun in my hand?
hat was this morning.
What do you mean?
To go to the theater. Wears I don't know what. Make-up, padding.
Why?
Yessiree, Bob.
Finally, I get a waiter who doesn't know "Macbeth".
Yes.
I kissed Shirley Felder on the teeth.
And he has finer moments now and then.
Engaging.
Elliot wants to kill him with a railroad spike.
What?
God gave you ten thumbs.
Is my finger supposed to be wrapped around that?
Enough.
I'm sorry.
I -- I mean it's all right. It doesn't matter.  I'm -- my name is Andrews, Charlie Andrews. I've come from India -- I've read a great deal about you.
If we obtain our freedom by murder and bloodshed I want no part of it.
Hm. And what should an "important professional" write about your response to General Smuts's new legislation?
Hm.  Is it?
Are you going to walk all the way?
Good.  Ba will have to teach you to spin too.
I'm sure I'm fit for at least five hundred miles.
I'm hardly that, Mr. Patel.
I dined at the prison.
Hm. Of course it is not quite that simple.
Assuming we are in agreement?
In Calcutta it's like civil war. The Muslims rose and there was a bloodbath, and now the Hindus are taking revenge -- and if we can't stop it there'll be no hope for the Hindus left in Pakistan.
I guess so.  Well, while you're up there, maybe you could tidy the place up a bit.
We're in the wrong place.  We're wasting time.
He's not here.  It's a blind alley.
Right now, <i>your</i> presence is creating more of a threat.  I don't think you have any concept of what we do here--how meticulous our preparations must be.  We are about to send twelve people through 140 million miles of blackness to rendezvous with an object the size of a house and the color of coal.  So it's rather critical to point them in the right direction. And we certainly don't need you looking over our shoulders.  Besides, I don't believe there is any evidence that the killer <i>is</i> amongst us.  I don't see too many other dead bodies littering the place.
Okay, how tall did you <i>used</i> to be?
Six one.
I have to know where you come from.
Leave?  Just a few million years ago every atom in this hair--in our bodies--was a part of a star. I don't see it as leaving.  I see it as going home.
What about you?  What's in this for you, Eugene?
How long do you stay up there before you go?
I'm sorry.  I'm sorry.
Where?
--You don't understand, they'll make the connection, they'll hoover again.  We should cut our losses.
Complicated.  I couldn't stop her apologizing.
Anything I've forgotten?
We want him--we were hoping he would get married and have children.  We'd like grandchildren.
What do you think?
He has the heart of an ox.  He could run through a Goddamn wall--if he could still run. Actually, he was a big college swimming star.
Yeah.
I'd have to bleach my hair.
Hugo!  I've found him!
Why don't we say we were together?
It was a mercy-killing after all.
It's here.  My heart.  I'm careful--weekly check-ups.  I'm on a drug maintenance program, blood thinners, diet--  I just want you to know what you'd be getting yourself into.
What <i>is</i> this place?
What about the car?
What happened?
A year is a long time.
The doctor will give you something.
Rudy Butler, Frank Jackson...
You know, you and I may be two of a kind.
Feel good?
Where do you want to go?
What's Beynon got set up?
Just like old times?
Yeah... I know.
That doesn't hurt.
Usually on the right side as you go in.
Do you trust him?
He must have.
Fifteen minutes.
Where are you going?
I always thought jails make people hard. Not you. You're just not tough enough to forget about Beynon. I chose you, not him.
No more about Beynon.
We get to Mexico, we can have a life.
Jeep. There's a dry river bed fifteen miles east. He takes us to the Mexican side, drops us off at the airfield by breakfast... we've got a 9 o'clock flight.
They will have our description before we can get a plane.
How long before this car's hot?
Hope you get to where you're going.
Two.
What about the vault?
How's Mama and the kids?
I guess you ain't gonna shoot me, are you?
Juarez - Chihuahua City road.
I don't think you have to worry much about Harold. He won't do anything.
I didn't know who Doreen was. Thought she was just another bird.
Do you want to be dead, Albert?
This is my brother's car.
Five grand. It belongs to you. Along with a little name I'm going to give you.
Nothing more? Just another feller?
I know him too.
Sid Fletcher.
You were seen parking your car. The demon king waves his wand and I was dispatched to bring you to him. Lucky for you I waited.
And what was that?
Does Brumby get a kick out of that crap?
You sure about that?
Now tell me the truth.
No.
It's a bloody funny thing. You know a bloke for six bloody years and all the time he's as calm as gentle Jesus...  ...then he goes and does a thing like that.  It's a bloody funny thing.
No. It's all right.
Oh, what you doing now?
You coming to South America?
Wilton Estate.
I couldn't believe it when I heard. Carter is suddenly attentive.
Did you work with him, Keith?
I mean, what for?
I'm at the Las Vegas. Behind the dance hall.  Do you know a man called Albert Swift?
Oh, I'm sorry to hear that.
Still got a sense of humour?
You're finished, Jack. You know that, don't you? I've bloody finished you.
They do that up North.
Not suede boots!
Knock it off, Gerald.
Oh... I think I'll stay as I am.
That's right, Harry.
Four hundred?
I had to.
They killed the goose.
It is.
Eh?
Eh...?
No.  That's absolutely right.
Shoes, boots, yes...
You...
What?
Somebody...
How?
Someone should rob the office.
He'd give me a job.
What?  What?  The leads.
Me?
Yes.
...I thought that we were only talking...
Absolutely.
That's right.
Why are you doing this to me, Dave. Why are you talking this way to me? I don't understand.  Why are you doing this at all...?
You went for it.
Why?
Why?  Why you going to give me five grand?
Do you need five grand?
Is that what I just said?
Can we get some coffee...?
Yeah.  That's swell.  Yes.  You're right.  How are you?
I don't...yes.  Okay, the board.
Well, they're old.  I saw the shit that they were giving you.
Huh?
Yes.  They are old.
It's a waste of time.
Yes.  I'm no fucking good.
That's...
He said he filed...
You think they're going to catch... where are you going?
...what am I going to do all month...
Yeah.  That's swell.  Another waste of time.
A waste of time?  Why?
They aren't?
Why don't you think so?
You understand?
Oh, God, I hate this job.
Read it.  Bruce and Harriett Nyborg.  What happened here?
Shelly: get in the office.
...that's why I came in.  I thought I...
Excuse me, sir...
Who told me wh...?  You've got a fuckin', you've...a...who is this...?  You've got a board-up on the window...Moss told me.
Please don't leave.  I'm going to talk to you.  What's your name?
I'm talking with Mr. Lingk.  If you please, I'll be back in.  I'll be back in a while...I told you, check with Mr. Williamson.
I'm going to have your job, shithead. I'm going downtown and talk to Mitch and Murrray, and I'm going to Lemkin.  I don't care whose nephew you are, who you know, whose dick you're sucking on.  You're going out, I swear to you, you're going...
Would you come in here, please?
Hey, hey, hey, easy friend.  That's the "Machine." That is Shelly "The Machine" Lev...
Shelly, you blew the last...
...do you want to go downtown...?
...I only...
You know what those leads cost?
...they kicked out.
I'm not sure I have two.
Wait.  Alright.  Fine.  The one.  Give me the lead.  Give me the one lead.  The best one you have.
Get 'em to me!
It's better than a good sale.  It's a...
Would you?  Would you...?  Or you're gonna what, fire me?
Yes.  I hear you.
What are you talking about?
I told the customer that his contracts had gone to the bank.
Do I have to tell you?  Moss.
Uh-huh?
What?
Don't.
"...you have to believe in yourself..."
Dave...
Just now.
Fuck you care...?
The only arrangement I'll accept is full investment.  Period.  The whole eight units.  I know that you're saying 'be safe,' I know what you're saying.  I know if I left you to yourselves, you'd say 'come back tomorrow,' and when I walked out that door, you'd make a cup of coffee...you'd sit down...and you'd think 'let's be safe...' and not to disappoint me you'd go one unit or maybe two, because you'd become scared because you'd met possibility.  But this won't do, and that's not the subject..." Listen to this, I actually said this. "That's not the subject of our evening together." Now I handed them the pen.  I held it in my hand. I turned the contract, eight units eighty-two grand. "Now I want you to sign."  I sat there.  Five minutes.  Then, I sat there, Ricky, twenty-two minutes by the kitchen clock.  Twenty-two minutes by the kitchen clock.  Not a word, not a motion. What am I thinking? "My arm's getting tired?" No.  I did it.  I did it.  Like in the old says, Ricky.  Like I was taught... Like, like, like I used to do...I did it.
...yes...
I wanted to speak with you about...
Sure.
You're sure?
Go ahead.
Ah.  Ah, his wife is.  Ray: what time do you have...?
Didn't I say I was taking the two o'...
Kenilworth.
Rick...?
Well, you want to swing by the Chinks, watch me eat, we'll talk?
I've got to talk to you.
I've got to talk to you...
She called the consumer...the attorney, I don't know.  The attorney gen...they said we have three days...
What is?
What's going on here?
I told you.
I don't have the power.  I said it.
I'll show you how to chew it." Your pal closes, all that comes out of your mouth is bile, how fucked up you are...
What is this, your farewell speech?
They didn't get your contract.  I filed it before I left.
Yes.
I have the stuff from last year's...
Patel?  Ravidam Patel?  How am I going to make a living on thses deadbeat wogs?  Where did you get this, from the morgue?
Mr. Lingk and I are going to...
John...
Yes.
Your friend lives in a fine building.
 What?  You read it in the papers?
What took so long?
Do you think he'd be satisfied with the two hundred dollars?  I think he would.
You fly around the world with lazy young men who don't have any love for you, and use you like a whore.
Michael, Fredo's in the house with Mama.  He asked for you, and Tom said he couldn't see you.
Deanna, I'm going to belt you right in the mouth!
You would risk your life for strangers?
Oh.  Mikey, what's up?  I'm totally in the dark.
I never met them.
No.  No, I didn't.  Who tells me anything?  I been kept in the dark so long, I'm getting used to it.
It was hard to have him killed.
It was never Pentangeli... I've always known that.  It was Roth all along.  He talks to me as a son; as his successor, but the old man thinks he'll live forever.
Fredo.  Where are you going?
What about now, is there anything you can help me out with?
Beautiful.
I bet you can't guess what happened?
I wish they had.  He takes fifty dollars a week from my father's cash drawer.  But you can't kill a man like Fanucci.
It's Michael's request...for your safety.  We can send out for anything you need.
... He said he had shot his Grandfather with a gun, and then he died in the garden.  And he asked me... he asked me, Tom, if that meant now his father would shoot him out of... revenge.  How does a four year old boy learn the word... 'revenge'?
You don't know that's true.  But Kay, just for the sake of an argument, let's assume it is, I'm not saying it is, remember, but... What if I gave you what might be some justification for what he did... or rather some possible justification for what he possibly did.
Okay, just hear me out.  What if Carlo had been paid to help get Sonny killed?  What if his beating of Connie that time was a deliberate plot to get Sonny out into the open? Then what?  And what if the Don, a great man, couldn't bring himself to do what he had to do, avenge his son's death by killing his daughter's husband?  What if that, finally, was too much for him, and he made Michael his successor, knowing that Michael would take that load off his shoulders, would take that guilt?
He's not the same as when I met him.
Hello?
I'm sorry; of course, you know that.
Will we...be able to get who ordered it out of them?
I asked about Fredo?
I turned Houstan down; I didn't see why I should tell you about an offer I turned down.  Are you sure, Mikey?  Are you sure of what we're doing; what we'll gain; what does the family gain? Forget that, Mike; I already know the answer.
We've never sent this much with one courier.
What's up?
I think I prefer to see my client privately.
You were around the old timers who dreamed up how the Families should be organized, how they based it on the old Roman Legions, and called them 'Regimes'... with the 'Capos' and 'Soldiers,' and it worked.
Yeah, it worked.  Those were great old days.  We was like the Roman Empire.  The Corleone family was like the Roman Empire.
This committee owes an apology!
I'm sorry, Michael.  Senator Geary's here, and Mr. and Mrs. Barrett wanted to thank you before they left.  Won't you join us, Mr. Ola?
Yes, Michael, it does.
Tell me, Michael.  What really happened with Pentangeli?
You would have killed his brother?
No, I don't want to hear anything. There are things between men and women that will not change; things that have been the same for thousands of years.  You are my wife, and they are my children... and I love you and I will not let you leave, because you are MINE!
The baby I lost...
Your family?  How can you ever lose your family?
Yes.
We're making a big investment in Cuba.  That's my only concern.
Still no word of your courier? We'll find him.  But at least this will satisfy our friends here. You've been invited to the New Year reception at the Presidential Home. I understand your brother is here as well; I hope he'll come.
Hiya, Mr. Corleone, I'm Sam Roth. Welcome to the Capri; my brother's upstairs.  You wanta take a rest before you see him, or can I get you something, anything at all?
This is it!  We think it makes Vegas look like the corner crap game.
I just left our friend in Miami.
Not good.
Let him gamble.
Is it true that in the year 1950 you devised the murder of the heads of the Five Families in New York, to assume and consolidate your nefarious power?
Michael, anything.  What is it I can do for you?
Frankie, Roth tried to have me killed.  I'm sure it was him, but I don't know yet why.
I thought we would meet alone.
We worked it all out beforehand.
Are we going to eat or what?
Don't I look like I'm listening?
Pari Persu; what the fuck is Pari persu...?
Your good heart in helping the poor widow has shamed me, and I want to show that I, too, have some Christian charity.  Her rent will remain what it was.
Yeah, well keep your filthy thoughts to yourself.
You liked it too.
If you enjoy it, you should do it.
What're you talking about?
You will not hurt him?
No.  No.  I am sorry.  Forget everything I say.  Here.  I will take the tray.
You ever been married, Hanna?
Then you're as single as I am.
No.  I have children, grandchildren too.  I visit when I can.  But now that Mr. Jimmy cannot be left very long, I do not get away much.  Poor Mr. Jimmy.  There is much good in him, but he will suffer the fires of hell.  Very sad.
Sins of the flesh?  Everybody has those.
You and he are not doing things?
Good.  That is what I hope.  I did not think you a bugger too.  I fear only that you might hurt him if he tries.
Take care of Mr. Whale like he was your flesh and blood.
I didn't do it.  This wasn't me.
But how're you going to explain this?  How did you get him out of the pool?
I couldn't help but notice your tattoo.  That phrase?  Death Before Dishonor.  What does it mean?
These are your paintings?
Excuse me, but -- are you famous?
Sure, everybody does.  When I was a kid I'd go with my sister twice a week.  Why?  Were you an actor or something?
You have the most architectural skull.  And your nose.  Very expressive.
What are you suggesting?  You'll charge extra if I include a hand or a bit of shoulder.
Sounds like something you feed the dog.
Saw your movie the other night. Watched it with some friends.
Did anyone laugh?
It's nothing to be ashamed of, in the service of one's country. That's something to be proud of.
Can I see what you did so far?
Why not?
What happened?
I'm curious, Mr. Boone.  What convinced you to come back?
You asked me to model.  Remember?
I don't hear anything.
After dinner, if Hanna isn't back? Can we try a few more sketches?
I'd like to try again.  If you're game.
I never made it to Korea.
Storm's getting worse.
I said it must be weird seeing your monsters again, and you said, "The only monsters are here."  I was wondering which here you meant.
So it is going to happen after all.
Please, Clayton.  Just for a minute.  Long enough for me to see the effect.
It's from the first World War, isn't it?
You'll feel better tomorrow.
You coming, Boone?
Just what I was about to ask you. I thought you were in New York.
You only embarrass yourself.
I would've thought Mr. Leslie Howard would be more your line.
Jimmy.  How are you?
I do not think you anything anymore.  Just back from the hospital and already you are chasing after boys.
Oh shut up.  All we did was talk. My attack had nothing to do with him.
Perhaps we should get you uphill before the pills knock you cold.
Who was that at the door?
Mr. Whale, this is such an honor. You're one of my favorite all-time directors.  I can't believe I'm meeting you.
Everything.  Start at the beginning.
Yes?
I have a proposal, Mr. Kay.  This mode of questioning is getting old, don't you think?
What rumors might those be?
George Cukor?  Who made "A Star Is Born"?  I never guessed.
Can we talk about the horror movies now?
Bet you thought you'd never see me again.  I didn't know if you'd be well enough to come to this party.
I commend you.  If you're going to pursue poofs, go after those who can do favors for you.  You waste everybody's time when you court dinosaurs.
What are you doing here?
It's been a long time, Memphis --
A boost. A big boost ...
It seems she neglected to mention it
I could kill you. That occurred to me. When I first heard about this. That I would kill you ...
This is number 50. We did it. It's over Where's the money ?
What do you mean -- ?
Leg's all banged-up. He made a stupid play ... He'll limp around the yard up at Folsom. But Astricky will be there to take care of him. With their priors, they're looking at a serious bounce --
Let them go. And I'll leave ...
Double-meaning intended --
No faith in our new-found goodness, Detective ...?
Got it ...
Diane 1.
Donny --
Forget that ...
Eleanor is Memphis' "unicorn."
There's no one left ...
That's a good one, Donny...
How are we supposed to--
What does that mean -- ?
What are you doing back?
He's in some trouble ...
I know...
Oh, for God's sake
Hey, Kip, what's up?
This has nothing to do with any of that --
All my enemies own car crushers. It's like a pre-requisite ... Owwww...
Yeah -
About Calitri? No worries, man. I'll call him. He's a reasonable dude ...
What happened to you?
I can handle it --
You can handle it?
We do this. Then. You're finished. Then. You're clean
You hear me?
Maybe not. But Dad was from another era...
What era was that -- ?
I've missed you, man ...
What are you doing here?
Ya gotta keep tabs on your "Eleanors", Memphis. Cos you never know when you're gonna need one --
He give you an advance -- ?
I left town. I didn't leave you.
Six or seven...
I'm not doing it anymore. Haven't for a while. I've carved out something for myself. It's pathetic, but it's mine ...
I think so... They're just... So ...
Arright ... Enough ... I can't have you bellying up to my heart again, man, f you can't help falling off the stool. But he puts his mouth to her ears ...
Unlock your button ...
The alarms go off ...
Where to -- ?
What -- ?
Are you considering a comeback tour?
The hard part ...
You need him...
I logged outside the G.R.A.B. site, right? Then I monitored their incoming outside data requests, right? Then I got these ISDN numbers, right? Then I tracked them back, right? Then I took the one I could jack-up the easiest, right? Then I called back see, they think I'm an insurance company - that's where it looks like I'm coming from -- and they're sharing stats with this insurance company, right? So now they're sharing it with me, right? They think I'm looking for stats for an actuarial conference on auto-theft. So they let me in, right? Give me all these numbers. But then I don't leave, right? I'm in. I've got the key. Now I just go anywhere I want.
You're gonna be okay, Toby... You are ... We'll getcha fixed up...
Talk? To you? After what you did!
What are you gonna do?
The bag with the envelopes.
The truth was, that no matter how bad I felt, I was still very attracted to him. Why should I give him up to someone else? Why should she win?
You got money for your bullshit television, don't you?  I gotta watch you swimming back and forth on TV all night long, don't I? You got money for that, but you don't have my money?
There are cops all over the place.
He's hiding, thE son of a bitch, in Florida.
I want to talk to Jimmy.
But I got two hundred and fifty coming.  It's my share.  Jimmy owes me.
You know what to do?
Now this is important. Make sure you leave the house when you make the call. You understand? Do you hear me? It's important.  Call from an outside phone. I mean it.
What for? I got a pound of stuff in my jacket I've been carrying around all day. We gotta start taping it to your leg.
I gotta talk to him as soon as I can.
He's with his friends.
Who's she talking to?
Suck my cock!
Yeah, so he's like "Check the front of my truck, I can prove I hit it 'cause there's probably some blood or something"--
Stop brushin' me back!
Hey, thanks for comin' out.
Sorry, brother.  I don't know what to tell ya. You know all the girls I been with. You been with 'em too, except for Cheryl McGovern which was a big mistake on your part brother...
Yeah, sit in a room and do long division for the next fifty years.
I guess so.
Is this a bad time?
I don't care what his family's like or if he doesn't have any brothers, but he doesn't have to lie to me.
Is that true?
WILL!
Morgan, I'm not goin' to "Kelly's Roast Beef" just cause you like the take-out girl. It's fifteen minutes out of our way. MORGAN What else we gonna do we can't spare fifteen minutes?
Would you shut the fuck up! I know what you ordered, I was there!
You got fired from pushing a broom, you little bitch.
My uncle can probably get you on my demo team.
Did your Uncle get arrested?
Will, our offer starts you at eighty- four thousand a year, plus benefits.
Will you take a check?
Hey, come on pal we're in classes all day. That's one thing about Harvard never seizes to amaze me, everybody's talkin' about school all the time.
What is it?
Could you just check, because the young man who works in my building--
That would be a monumental waste of time, wouldn't it, Will?
That's fine, but did you ever think--
It's right.  Take it home with you.
--Maybe I don't want to spend my life sittin' around and explaining shit to people.
The least you can do is show me a little appreciation.
Can we do it at my office?
Tom.
To show me he doesn't have to talk to me if he doesn't want to.
Oh, what is this? Some kind of staring contest between two kids from the "old neighborhood?"
You're here quite a bit, then.
That's great, Gerry, that there's interest-- But I'm not sure he's ready for that.
Who?
--No, no you hear me out, Sean. This young man is a true prodigy--
--Personal rivalry? I'm not getting back at you.
This is a disaster! I brought you in here to help me with this boy, not to run him out--
Oh, come on, Sean--
--Is that what this is about, Sean? The Field's Medal? Do you want me to go home and get it for you? Then will you let the boy--
If you push him into something, if you ride him--
What's the point?
Will, I can't believe you brought Skylar here when we're all wrecked. What's she gonna think about us?
So, you finally got a job Morgan?
I could work the pit maybe, but I could never drive like Dale Ernhart--
--you have a quality-- something you were born with, that you have no control over- and you are, in a sense, hiding that by becoming a janitor. And I'm not saying that's wrong. I'm friends with the janitor that works in my building. He's been to my house for dinner. As a matter of fact I did some free consultation for "Mike" -- that's not his real name. That's in my book.
I might understand that.
Buddy, two seconds ago you were ready to give me a jump.
I'm sure you do. You probably got a real nice house, nice car -- your book's a best seller.
You ever heard the saying, "any port in a storm?"
--Well, maybe that means you.
Maybe you married the wrong woman.
You're just a boy. You don't have the faintest idea what you're talking about.
You know, I was on this plane once. And I'm sittin' there and the captain comes on and is like "we'll be cruising at 35,000 feet," and does his thing, then he puts the mike down but forgets to turn it off. Then he says "man, all I want right now is a blow-job and a cup of coffee." So the stewardess goes runnin' up towards the cock-pit to tell him the mike's still on, and this guy in the back of the plane goes "don't forget the coffee!"
You've never been on a plane.
Fine.
I teach this shit, I didn't say I knew how to do it.
No, I don't.
I didn't write anything else 'cause nobody, including most of my colleagues bothered to read the first one.
Lon? He got married. He has a kid. I kind of lost touch with him after Nancy got sick.
October 21, 1975. Game six of the World Series. Biggest game in Red Sox history, Me and my friends slept out on the sidewalk all night to get tickets. We were sitting in a bar waiting for the game to start and in walks this girl. What a game that was. Tie game in the bottom of the tenth inning, in steps Carlton Fisk, hit a long fly ball down the left field line. Thirty-five thousand fans on their feet, screamin' at the ball to stay fair. Fisk is runnin' up the baseline, wavin' at the ball like a madman. It hits the foul pole, home run. Thirty-five thousand people went crazy. And I wasn't one of them.
I was havin' a drink with my future wife.
I don't know.
Not to me, they're not.
Why is it a cop-out? I don't see anythin' wrong with layin' brick, that's somebody's home I'm buildin'. Or fixin' somebody's car, somebody's gonna get to work the next day 'cause of me. There's honor in that.
Gotta go with the belt there...
Don't fuck with me.
Yeah, I think so.
I'll keep in touch.
Five minutes.
Yeah?
Yes you were.
Do you keep in touch with them?
I'm sorry, I been real busy.
I'm supposed to understand this.
It's important that I learn this.
Why is it important to you? If I inherited all that money, the only thing important to me would be workin' on my swing.
Rich? I have an inheritance. It's two handred and fifty thousand dollars. That's exactly what it'll cost me, minus about five hundred bucks, to go all the way through med school. This is what I'm doing with that money. I could have done anything I wanted. I could have expanded my wardrobe, substantially.
Nobody does organic chemistry for "fun." It's unnecessary. Especially for someone like you.
I'm trying to explain it to you. So you play the piano. When you look at the keys, you see music, you see Mozart.
I see "Hot Cross Buns," but okay.
Why not?
Is that what you think--
What, you want to come in here and save me? Is that what you want to do? Do I have a sign that says "save me" on my back?
Take care.
Leave him alone, Ma--Al's just billy- goatin' around--
We're goin' to California, ain't we? Awright then, let's *go* to California.
Ready, Ma?
Woman can change better'n a man. Man lives in jerks--baby born, or somebody dies, that's a jerk--gets a farm, or loses one, an' that's a jerk. With a woman it's all one flow, like a stream, little eddies, little waterfalls, but the river it goes right on. Woman looks at it like that.
Looks like about a mile. Reckon she'll make it?
We just picked him up on the way in. He went away this mornin' when the rate dropped.
Banana cream, pineapple cream, chocolate cream--and apple.
Okay, mister. Whatcha payin'?
Say, who runs this place?
*You* find out, I can't.
Can't promise you that, but there'll be a licensed agent here tomorrow mornin', if you want to talk to him.
Yeah. On my way home now.
Well, I do declare!  I baptized you, son.
Pa always said you was never cut out to be a preacher.
I never let one go by me when I could catch her.
I don't mind any more. I'd do what I done again. I killed a guy at a dance. We was drunk. He got a knife in me and I laid him out with a shovel. Knocked his head plumb to squash.
They never wrote you nothing?
This used to be mine. I give it to Grampa when I went away.  You reckon they could be dead?
Casy! What you doin' here?
Well, if it ain't Tom Joad. How ya, boy?
I guess that's right. Have to take a beatin' before he'll know.
They shore don't waste no time!  Take her out.
Want to work, do you?
No, my old man got a place, forty acres. He's a sharecropper, but we been there a long time.
Yeah.
Workin'. Pickin' peaches. But I seen a bunch a fellas yellin' when we come in, so I come out to see what's goin' on. What's it all about?
An' the nex' thing you know you'll be out, because they got it all figgered down to a T--until the harvest is in you're a *migrant* worker--afterwards, just a bum.
Easy, *easy!* You wanta bust his head wide open? Pull his arms, John.
How 'bout Granma?
How long you plan to be in Arizona?
No longer'n we can get acrost her.
Got any plants?
Thought I'd take a walk. Any law against it?
You mean I can't even get outa here?
Wouldn't be no use. I'd still see 'em inside the tent.
Now don't you go gettin' nimsy-mimsy.
Sometimes I'm all jumpy inside.
Don't it ever scare you it won't be nice in California like we think?
Glad to get shet of him. Never was no good an' never will be--
Thank God!  An' we're still together-- most of us. 
Since before they stopped us las' night.
I'm a-tryin', Ma. Honest I am.
I'm sorry, Ma. But--I didn't know what I was doin', no more'n when you take a breath. I didn't even know I was gonna do it.
She's gettin' prettier, Ma.
It had to come, I reckon, soon or later.
Tommy, they'll drive you, an' cut you down like they done to Casy.
Good-by, Tom. Later--when it's blowed over--you'll come back? You'll try to fin' us?
Tommy?
Listen!  That's some of what done it--the dusters. Started it, anyway. Blowin' like this, year after year--blowin' the land away, blowin' the crops away, blowin' us away now.
You mean get off my own land?
Got that desert yet. Gotta take her tonight. Take her in the daytime fella says she'll cut your gizzard out.
Maybe it's nice on the other side. Them pitchers--them little pos'cards-- they was real pretty.
What's these?
Welcome back! I'm Arlene Oslott- Joseph.
What?
Yeah... Hey, I saw you at your dad's dealership the other day.
Bob...
He gets this way when he hits over eighty-five.
I'm in California most of the time. Traveling a lot on business. That's about it, really.
Not much else.
More like what happened? What happened, Mr. Blank?
--Yes. Actually we just bought that little Frank Lloyd Wright on Pine Avenue... Debi's a social worker and I mow down insurance claims at Aetna--
Which would you rather...?
No time.
Let me help you along, Martin. You're a sociopath!
That's probably a good idea.
What if I come back?
Why not. I trust you. You couldn't turn me in because of Doctor-Patient privilege... and I don't want to be "withholding"... and I know where you live.
Anyway, that never use to happen. I was always the prodigy. Now I'm just one of the guys.
Do you like the people you work with?
I know what I do isn't moral, per se, but if you could just look past that, you'd see a man worth loving.
--Nooo--
We can't do our job unless he does his job.
Did you see Blank in there?
It's from one of those P.O. Boxes. How was the trip?
You have.
It's good to see you. I'm sure you're curious about what I've been doing.
I imagine that'd be rather difficult.
God it's great to see you.
Debi's house.
Ten years. What happened!?
He sold me this bad boy.
That's too bad.
So what are you doing with your life now, son?
Well, you know, however you want to put it -- I got your information from the publisher of the article. I called Montana and your sister-in-law, I think, gave me this number.  I'm been hot on your trail you could say because I was hoping you'd consider coming to New York and taking a look at my daughter's horse and possibly --
When I work with a horse, it's no good just me doing it. It doesn't work that way. The owner needs to be involved too.
So how was your first and last day of branding?
What's that to miss?
You haven't heard the question yet. Truth is, you'd be doing me a favor. I got all these eager young colts need riding and poor old Rimrock here is feeling kind of left out...
Thanks.
Son?
Oh. Well, what are you going to do? You have to go to school, honey. I mean, what --
I'm not coming back! That's it! I want to go home!
Grace, I put it on the table near your --
Look, if you want to take it in the morning, that's fine.
I already did.  This morning. When you went running.
This'll be nice. We haven't seen any of the sights yet. It's history. When I was thirteen I used to love seeing things like this.
There was supposed to be a turn off. Did I miss it?
Well, one was for salad...
What are you talking about?
What?
So do you.
Good.
That bag's almost empty.
I'm sorry.
Oh, uh, I meant to tell you... Alex brought that fabric over...
Okay.
You've got to stop doing that?
Doing what?
What did he say?
I've called Liz. They can set me up with a trailer for Pilgrim. I thought we'd stay at motels along the way...
You know, I just asked that myself tonight. He doesn't know.
Fine. Actually, today was a good day. You should have seen her.
Connecticut. I told the office I'd work out of there next week. When are you planning to start back?
Take your time.
No. I am a "tubab."
Oh, I don't know...
Mm-mm. I never knew him. He died before Frank and I met. This here's...  Frank and Tom's mother and father... there's little Frank and Tom...
No, it's more like a leave of-  Ha, ha, ha. Yeah, they fired me.
Now, are you sure you want to drive that horse back yourself? There are plenty of people 'round here who do that sort of thing.
Annie, no matter what I do, this horse will never be the same.
Of course not.
Mixed salad.
Oh Frank, don't forget the wedding present -- it's behind the door in the laundry room.  I got her a pasta maker from the catalogue... Not that they'll know what to do with it in Branton, Missouri... Probably use it as a planter.
Bank out us a couple more men to run the cattle.
They don't get burned by the sun bouncing off the snow. And they're good mother.
She gonna be long?
Just follow this. Nothing to it. I'm going to shut my eyes here for a little while. Just keep going till you run out of road.
I don't know if I can.
He's not hurt. He's okay. Look at him.
It's warmer than I thought.
Jude, you okay?
I know. Amazing.
Shouldn't we have invited Tom over?
We still have a way to go.
Well, like I told your wife, it's really up to Pilgrim.
Fit? You want to check my teeth.  Good crowd today. I think you'll have some fun. You going to stay for dinner?
You know, Rona, we weren't all that good together even when we were good together.
I'm sorry, sir. We caught him by surprise, so we don't think he had time to erase his computer files.
And never again have to pay for a service that would be dirt cheap...
Look, you wanna be elite? You gotta do a righteous hack. None of this accidental shit.
One-handed!
Oh wow, we are fried.
Curtis.
Crash Override.
This Ellingson security creep. I gave him a copy of the disc you gave me.
Dade.
You would have looked better.
Uhhmmm... uh gee, uh...
Yo, chill man, I'm talking to Venezuela.
Homicidal?
There's a new virus in the database.
A rabbit replicates till it overloads a file, then it spreads like cancer.
Colonel who?
Big deal. A garbage file's got shit in it, Joey, come on.
Phreak?
So what are we supposed to do?
What the hell was that all about?
Congratulations.
Hello, operator services.
555-4202.
Jamie needs a Halloween costume.
Okay sure. What about?
My parents are going to come home early tonight.
We've been better.
You think she stands a chance?
What does that mean?
Go!
Brady!
I've seen bodies thrown 50-60 feet from a crash site.
I told them to be here by nine. Its not 9:30 yet.
Four plus Myers.
I'm Dr. Hoffman, Medical Administrator.
What the hell did this?
Do you love me Rachel?
Like a sister?
I know you miss your parents, its hasn't been that long.
Sure it is. I think tonight Brady was ready to make a commitment.  But now my future relationship, my engagement, my marriage, my children, your grandchildren, have all been wiped out because I have to baby sit tonight.
Well tonight we're going to do something better. We're going to go trick-or-treating.
You ready for some Ice Cream?
Rachel, can I go get my costume on?
Rachel come on.
I can't.
Everybody's dead. I just wanna go home.
Don't you mean what you do best?
Well I don't want to come on too strong. A guy hates a girl to come on strong. Fragile egos and all of that.
Well do I drop you off at the Discount Mart or the Dairy Queen?
Call me.
Isn't this all a little paranoid?
That's impossible. Michael Myers is an invalid.
Where ever she is, that little girl is in mortal danger.
Something?
How can a man do this Loomis? Tell me.
What is he? Tell me! What the hell are we dealing with?
Car trouble?
Sort of.
Your hunting it, ain't ya? Yeah, your hunting it all right, just like me.
You blame everything on kids.
You're going to be late at the Doyles, Annie.
You're going to be late!
I wouldn't want to get you in deep trouble, Lynda.
Shit!
I'M baby sitting for the Doyles. It's only three houses away. We can keep each other company.
Well, home sweet home. I'll see you later.
Why did you hang up on me?
Annie, was that you?
I always said you'd make a fabulous girl scout.
I hate that dog. I'm the only person in the world he doesn't like.
I can't.
Yes, you can.
Then why are you sitting here with half the lights off?
Yeah.
Yeah.
Looks like to me you're just plain scared.
What do we do?
Sure...
Okay. Later.
Are you coming over tonight?
Same time, same place.
Yes, I am.
Laurie...
Do you believe everything that Richie tells you?
What did he look like?
I'm scared...
PROBABLY going.
The driveway's a few hundred yards up on your right.
Pull up to the entrance!
...because there are no interesting single men at this party!
Hm-mm.  Oh, yeah.  I met Phil.
Yeah.
Oh, is that what it is?
...a monstrosity!  Who would do that?
Well, wait.  You know what?  I know.
Yeah, we have Mr. Morris Levine's eightieth birthday party on Riverside Drive...or Riverside Memorial Chapel, depending on his health.
I gave blood before and, uh... clothing to the poor.
Really?  Is the food that bad?
You're Holly.
Y-you live in Chelsea, don't you?
Mm-hm.
I always, I-I always imagine that I have things.
What a weirdo that guy is!  Paranoid.  What's the matter with you?
I got a lot more to learn, though. I really wasn't into art when I was a kid.
Yeah.
Fine.  Oh, we went to the Caravaggio exhibition at the Met.  It's such a treat to go through a museum with Frederick.  I mean...you learn so much.  Do you like Caravaggio?
Well, sure.
Well, thanks a lot.
Yeah, she loves to go out in the woods.
Yes.  This kid, he's earned a trillion dollars.
Wh-- She's never said anything, and we're very close.  She'd tell me such a thing.
But-but, but how about you?  Do you, do you share any of my feelings? Or is this just an unpleasant embarrassment to you?
Yes, but you, you do care about me.
I almost didn't.
I didn't sleep all night.
That was just perfect.  You've ruined me for anyone else.
I was so worried I wouldn't compare with Hannah.
If-if-if you can believe I have such feelings for you!
Great idea.
It's so late.
Are you in love with someone else?
It's so pitch-black tonight.  I feel lost.
Oh, Mom!
You're not going to abuse them. They're all so sweet.
Mm-hm.
You know, you've been very nervous lately.
But not you.
Well, he has to rule out certain things. 
Yeah.  What?
Come on.
...'cause every time I try to be helpful, you know, sh-she gets so defensive.
I'm okay.
Yeah?
Huh?
H-he's so awkward and he's clumsy like me...
Mh-hm.
Go right over there.
Come on!  Hurry up!  Let's go!
Maybe when she's eighty, she'll stop straightening her garter belt when there's a guy around.
Oh, he's such a loser!
...and then she just breaks down.  And he has this sweet daughter...and when she goes to college next year, he's going to split permanently.  I mean...
You know.
I know, no--  I know.
Awwww...
Yeah, that's clerical.
Yeah, that's tough!  You don't deserve Cole Porter.  You should stay with those groups that look like they're gonna stab their mother!
And you don't have to snort cocaine at the table all the time!  What do you, what do you do?  Carry a kilo around in your purse?
It was a terrible evening.
Well, I hope you've changed.
So how are you?
You didn't answer my question. What are you doing?
Are you, are you out of work or something?
Oh...well, you-you're not interested in this.
What...what about your script?  So what's it about?
Oh, it just came to me one day.
Oh, gosh, you really think I can write?
It's all right.
Do you?  I mean, are you, are you, are you, are you free this evening?
Hi.  How you doin'?
Yeah.
Dad...
Oh...
Hi.
Well, okay.  Thank you very much.
I can't think.
Some museum director disappeared.
It's a growth business.
We could skip the Gavotte.
No, you're wrong about Verger.
And who is "they?"
That's right.
I almost shot the <u>baby</u>...
Yeah, so where is he?
Please, I do not... I don't want to <u>trouble</u> him.  But if you or he have any notlon, who would be buying Dr. Lechter's...
Try Barney Clark.
He is...?
He was the orderly, during Dr. Lechter's stay in Prison.
No, no, of course not.
I believe that your tone implied that there was some <u>good</u> news.... and, do you know... there might be good news for <u>you</u>...
Oh, yes, what?  You'd <u>bribe</u> me, to, to, to, "release" you...?
For a consideration.
I could have acted on my own.  I was told...
Look at this:
A fellow with five fingers.
Am I on that case, sir...? 
We have a memo here, from your friend Mr. Krendler at the Justice Department.
I am all attention.
I'm going to work for your reinstatement...
Your girl's a menace.  Here, givver <u>this</u>... Getter off the street and teach her some <u>humility</u>. 
....I didn't realize I said it out loud.
Said what?
...how so?
...you told me you were studying for your examination by the <u>Studiolo</u>...
I know that the officers who first investigated his disappearance searched for a <u>note</u>, a farewell note, a suicide note...
If your duty requires it.
How so?
I <u>sense</u>...  The faintest <u>whiff</u> of a perfume, whose <u>base</u>, whose <u>base</u>, whose <u>base</u> is "Hamamelis" ... it is <u>witch-hazel</u>--such a clean scent.  No, not a European scent. I would say it is a scent of the New World.  I would say, you have been in America.  Have I struck home?
Dr. Fell is studying for his examination by the Studiolo.
In and out.  Yes.  And Mama... and Mama, is not your real Mama, is she Franklin?
You were given backup....
I'm saying: ... and what's wrong with that.
What is that that smells so wonderful.
You don't wish to <u>beg</u>...?
Our Mister <u>Frendler</u> to, to, to humiliate me, though....
Because you're going to help me plan a party.
...what...?
Trouble is, they all seem to <u>die</u>.
Don't shoot yourself.
Why?
They aren't expensive, you got them through your connections.... speaking of which:
...and that is what you need to expand.
...why are we here in the <u>first</u> place...?
No.  Invite us?  No, he simply...
Because...?
I know where he is.
But perhaps, there is some, some less radical solution.
Is it necessary to say of the sea that it is salt, that the stars are far, that...
...and to have <u>done</u> it, means, can mean to accept, not only <u>danger</u>, but <u>betrayal</u>...?
Yes, so you said.  But what does that mean:  to go beyond The Institution.
If <u>he</u> could overcome... his need for... for self-<u>ratification</u>...
For approval.
That if <u>decision</u> were a useful tool, you wouldn't <u>be</u> here.  Why are you here...?
I want to do something <u>positive</u>...
Yes.
Because, sir, you are the only one of his victims who lived.  And because you have large resources.
But, but that was before we started sharing stuff. Before I told you how I cried when Peepers died. I never told anyone that before.
Okay, okay, just don't everyone talk at once...First of all, little Jason has a learning disability...
Now what? What did I do this time?
Call me conservative, but I'd rub my penis on the faces of all the ladies before bestowing the final honors to the divine Ms. Berry's lovely visage.
When did pretending to be bored become a sign of superiority?  Are you mad at me for giving the cabin new haircuts or are you just still miserably pining for Wichita's lightning rod?
Who wants to go tell the Anti-christ to take a "time-out?"
I love you. Don't say I love you, too. I hate that--"love you, too."
Do you really think we're fooling anyone?
Iunno.  Of course I believe you. It's so you...I didn't think it was possible                        ] for you to make me feel worse,                              ] but...you're saying you <u>deliberately</u>                        ] destroyed us!

In my heart, Heather's still alive.
Take a break Veronica, sit down.
Shit, Heather. I don't have anything against Martha Dunnstock.
You don't have anything <u>for</u> her either. Come on, it'll be Very. The note'll give her shower nozzle masturbation material for weeks.
Just imagine somebody like your quasi-fat, goody-good friend Betty Finn doing a Crest commercial. No one would buy Crest.
You wanted to become a member of the most powerful clique in the school. If I wasn't already the head of it, I'd want the same thing.
Oh God Veronica, my afterlife is s-o-o boring. If I have to sing "Kumbaya" one more time...
So tonight's the night. Are you two excited?
Maybe you should see a doctor.
No.
Ram asked me out, but he wants to double with Kurt and Kurt doesn't have a date.
You're giving your life away to become a goddamn statistic in U.S. Fucking A Today. That's got to be the least private thing I can think of.
Hey now, if you were happy every day of your life, you wouldn't be a human being, you'd be a game show host.
Just a humble perk from my Dad's Construction company or should I say Deconstruction company?
Heather Chandler is one bitch that deserves to die.
See the condoms in the grass over there. We killed tonight, Veronica. We murdered our baby.
I'm a Pine-Sol man, myself.
Something tells me you picked up the wrong cup.
Ram and I died the day we realized we could never reveal our forbidden love to an uncaring and ununderstanding world. The joy we shared in each other's arms was greater than any touchdown. Yet we were forced to live the lie of Sexist- Beer Guzzling-Jock-Asshole.
They used them on themselves to make it look like they were dead. Really quite a brilliant device, but too flamboyant to seriously produce.
Can't you see this is a special moment?
Veronica is into his act. No doubt.
Shut the fuck up, all right.
Terrible thing. So will we get to meet this dark horse prom contender?
Turn that back on!
But my name's not...
It's all yours, Heather. Now if you'll excuse me, I'm going to go throw up.
accompanies Hilda into the hallway.
Bye.
wanders out. HONORA turns to Pauline and Juliet.
I just want to be on my own for a while.
Do you think Juliet could stay here while her parents are away?
If you think for one minute that your father and I will tolerate this sort of behaviour, you've got another thing coming! You're only 14!!! You're a child! What on earth's the matter with you, Yvonne? You know what can happen with boys . . . Don't you have any self-respect?
My God, what a disgrace you are! You shame me, you shame the family. You're nothing but a cheap little tart!
That's coming along well!
I know it's hard for you being in here, but it is for the good of your health.
They sent me off to the Bahamas "for the good of my health." They sent me to the Bay of bloody Islands "for the good of my health."
Oh-what a nice outfit!
She's terribly hurt . . .
James will be there . . . and Mario! Only they'll be saints.
To be known as He!
How do you know? Did he tell you?
Hurry up! I'm freezing!
I thought he was supposed to be terribly ill.
Do you think Bloody Bill's trying to get into her draws?
Bye, Dad.
What's happening to me? What are you doing?
If they're blocked memories... I'm starting to realize the reason why I blocked them out. Allison I think I really... screwed everything up.
Trevor things like this happen to people who experience temporary memory loss. Everybody does things they regret. You just couldn't remember doing these things and now you are so it's a shock to the system. I'm telling you. You will never get better if you keep blaming yourself for your wife's death.
Hey Bret. Christ, my head feels like a split coconut.
Ambrose. I know.
Zero's a number right?
Come on speak up, Gooding, I'm trying to run a business here. I can't have people flipping out in the break room when they should be slaving away at their desks.
Gwen, my wife's dead.
Uh... eighty two?
You win! Okay pull over.
Just concentrate on the task at hand please. Listen to me. You should be giving ME this lecture.
Oh my God. It's coming out.
In a word? Lucrative.
Really, why's that?
Where's my wife?
How is our little student doing? Has he learned his lesson yet?
Wait... what the hell is this...
... knock on my door, I'm a total insomniac.
Tawny? What's- what are you doing?
Wow. That's good. Lots of capers, huh?
You must have been very proud of yourselves...
Nah, I fucked it up.  I was tryin' to impress this kid, don't ask me why.  I was gonna rescue his old man, but I couldn't find the poor bastard.  He musta blew up.  I got the hell outta there.  I didn't have the nerve to face the kid.
Looks like you live in here, for Chrissake!
I was in the can, for Chrissake.
Great!  You make this big goddamn mess, then ya jump.  Beautiful! Listen, John, I was there at the hospital today, I seen you with those little bastards .
You got it?  Four year scholarship to a top college, plus Medical School or Law School or whatever Joey wants; pay off the $2,500 to my attorney, plus pay her fee in full, plus my annual consulting fee...
You'll tell him I talked you out of jumping, right?  Just keep me outta prison.
Same with me, pretending I was you. An impulse.  Why not?  I had this shoe.
What's going on?  "Guilty"!  What is this?
"The Angel of Flight 104!"  You're telling me you're the A...?
Mister LaPlante, I really want to help you, but crazy stories are only going to make it worse.  The D.A. is asking your bail be set at twenty-five thousand dollars because you were arrested again while you were out on bail...
Whaddaya mean they didn't reduce the bail?  If they didn't reduce it, how'dja spring me?
Mister LaPlante...
You got a ten year old attorney, Bernie?
You in business with those guys or what?  I wouldn't want a problem for the establishment, Bern.
I am so tired of your bullshit, Bernie.
"Elliot"?  The heroic goddamn fireman?
Turn that thing off.
You were saying you don't want a million dollars.
Is she... serious?  A half a million dollars?  In my behalf?
What's the matter?
This guy LaPlante won an award?
We're gonna feature Gale's cast more.  The trick is gonna be keeping the upper hand on this piece. As long as we have Gale and there's no mystery guy, we're the center of the story.  But if he shows up and somebody else gets him first or exclusive...
I thought they'd all go "It's him! It's him!" and hug the guy or something.
Quit?  She wants to quit?
She wants to quit?
Helluva story!
"This is Gale Gayley for Channel Four News!"  Incredible. Unbelievable!  For Bernie LaPlante! He's a celebrity now?  'Cause he stole <u>paint</u>?
There's no face really, nothing to work with.  Big dots, that's all you'll get.
What about?
Who?
A lot of my stuff hasn't been unpacked yet.  Here's the TV.
And what about work?  Have you had any more thoughts about what you'd like to be doing now?
That would be stupid.
It's not going to happen unless you make it happen, my friend. You're going to have to assert yourself a little bit more.  <u>Show</u> your affection.
I can't help you if you don't help yourself.  It's really up to you. Brooding endlessly isn't going to help matters any.
Oh, great.
An occupational hazard, I'm afraid.
A man scared me.
Why are you mad at each other?
You know how sometimes Neil bugs you and you just get up and walk away from him?
Mommy!
And?
Whew.
The pocket's a cinch -- I'll sew it up for you after dinner, okay?
Neil, don't leave the back doors open -- I don't want Holly near the pool.
But it's what we want.
You want me to bargain at the high end of our range?  -- I'll have a stroke.  I've got to save all my sweat for my meeting in three weeks.
And it's a shorter commute.
What?
He made, you know, a remark.
How was your lunch with Charlie?
No.
The floor has a nice shine to it.  Oh God -- we have twenty-two messages on the machine.
Philip!  The senior partner?
I think you should feel like dancing at a time like this.
And what was that neighbor guy doing here?
I think it's time I came home now.
What?
Not very long.  There have been a couple of bids already.
Just reduced.
Sometimes they prefer a quicker return on their investment.
How large is your brood?
Okay!  We have TV!  We can all get stupid again!
I've been going through a lot of personal crap, all right?
Y'know what?  I'm ready to cancel our trip.  I really am. I've had it.
No.
Oh yeah?  Where's the bed?
Even better.
Would you?
What the hell.  What is this?  A joke?
Am I supposed to believe that this guy got shot in the chest six times at point blank range and just got up and walked out?
Lieutenant Bedsoe?
Good -- also, give it to the papers and TV.
It's not a homicide, Lieutenant.
Central Park.
No.  I don't scare easy.
Yes -- I think it is.
Since we hardly know each other, I'm sure you'll understand if I hold one to it for awhile.
Thomas Cavenaugh.  I am a teacher of sorts.  Like Romeriz I help those newly acquainted with our life.
Must you do that?
For being a friend when I needed one. I hope our paths cross again.
As friends -- always as friends.
Can you really tell from doing that?
Agreed.
I would like to say goodbye.
Then take me with you.
Why are you doing this?
Yes.  How did you know?
What's going on?  Why did he call you Macleod?
--the Calan.  Do you know who they are?
How could that be?  People don't live for three hundred years.
I am stronger than you, Highlander.
The police still have a lot of questions for Russell Nash.
I'm glad you've come home, Conner.
I haven't lived life -- I've hidden from it.  I've existed in the shadows.
Dear, sweet, Rachel.  Men's lifes are measured by the good they do.
I can take care of myself.
I think he's dead!
The house belongs to Walter and Pamela Smith.  They've got two kids, a girl about fifteen and a boy younger, Jennifer and Thomas.
That would be the girl who opened the door.  Are the others inside?
He knows better than that.
<u>Get on the floor</u>!
That's why we gotta keep going.  I'm not gonna go in for murder.
We could've gone out the back!  You didn't have to shoot!
Not if they're looking at something else.
We're fucked.
What are you talking about?
I'm here.
That you, Talley?
Now I understand.  That helps.  I can make them understand that.
You picked a bad house to hole up in, son.
Two hundred thousand cash, right in your pocket, no one needs to know.
Talley lives here.  I don't know if the place has security or not.
I heard he's fucked up.  They're taking him to the hospital.
Goddamnit, tell me what you <u>know</u>.  Did the cops go in?  Did Smith have the disks?
I'll kill you!  You won't get the other disk!
I need to work out some stuff.
You're hiding, Jeffrey.  You're hiding from the job and you're hiding from me.
I should've called.  This thing broke right after we spoke, then everything happened so fast --
Want one?
Kevin left without you.
You'd better get out of here!  Kevin's coming back!
You gotta pee?
Whatever.
What do you want?
Dennis and Mars are in the den.  I'll get your brother, then come back for you. We'll go down the stairs and out the front door, you understand?
He didn't say.
Could you call me back on your phone? Right away.
They have security cameras.  Rooney would see you coming.
We're out two minutes, me and Dreyer.
Are all of you named Jones?
I think he was working on them today, so they're probably in his office.  Could you find them and see who they belong to?
Yes.
Then you have everything.  You can put them away.
A man has my family.  Gold watch here. Dark tan.
I can't control what happens.  The Sheriffs are running the scene.
My people are good to go.  You know who I mean?
Paul, we would like to speak to you in your office.
No, Bik, it's a code word for Tutsis.
Why not? These are not rebels, look at them. Soon they will be worthless to you. Why not take some money, for your work?
Here, here, a thousand US dollars - fifty thousand francs for my family. To let us drive off to the Mille Collines.
Ten.
Don't be foolish. There's more money to be made here.
If the UN changes your mandate could you stop the bloodshed?
Hold the line here. Do not shoot! The Colonel stabilizes the situation, his men watch the militia drive by. Paul approaches Oliver
Congratulations, Colonel. You have saved us all.
I don't understand.
Will you protect us.
What is it?
Paul, this scotch is exceptional.
As long as it is scotch.  Your white friends have abandoned you, Paul.
He did.
I admire you, General. How do you keep command of your men amidst such madness?
When?
No, sir.
I do not want to go to Gitarama, General.
You are a marked man.
The Americans, and the UN they have you as a war criminal. You are on a list.
Who will tell them? You need me to tell how you helped the hotel. The others who have gone, they blame you for all their misfortune. They say you led the massacres.
Business is good at the hotel?
A bargain buy, from China. Ten cents each, I'll get a dollar.
You have no whiskey?
Go! What the fuck sort of journalists are we, running from a war? I'm ashamed. Are you? Well, are ya'?
Great, I really need a shower.
Good. I'd like to book a massage.
Please, except my humblest apologies...
Where are we going, sir?
The fog is too heavy, sir.
Don't lie to me. What's your name?
What do you want?
Thomas wants advice?
He was not family. Family is all that matters. Do you think if you or I were being dragged from here, any one of them would lift a finger to help us?
Send them home. We are not the police. What do we have to protect them?
I will not have them on my conscience. They will stay in my room.
What are you saying, Tatsi?
You cannot go alone.
Why?
A car.
Paul, I pleaded with the president to go in and get you all. He told me it will not happen.
What is it like to fly on a plane, sir?
Maybe. But in business class there are fine wines, linens, Belgian chocolates.
Sir, Gregoire has been taking beers.
You are my family now, Zozo, my brother. I will get you out of here.
All. What do you mean all?
Please, papa, I have a secret path.
We'd've been splitsville years ago, with me the richest single woman in recorded history -- but Steven doesn't "believe" in divorce.
You're the Doctor, sweetheart. 'Guess the atropine worked, then.
It's not, baby. Just a matter of minutes now, before somebody pulls the trigger --
Mr. Price? Mrs. Price? Somebody? Hello??
What are you playing here, Price?
Where is it??
Oh, really: who?
If there really is someone else in this house, I think the four of us can handle the situation.
I wanna know first: to what do I owe this honor? I mean, I never even heard of this guy.
What is it? What's in there?
Shit, Pritchett!!!
Prove it.
I'm better than that.
You hear somebody?
-- that's the fact, bud --
Cheery looking bunch.
Price!!
You've got your own TV show?
I'm not laughing, Steven.
Shredded. Sorry. Decided to whip up one of my own: a group so hungry for money that they'd be willing to do anything. I thought you'd be more comfortable with your peers.
I guess it was stupid of me not to expect something this twisted from you. Well, congratu-fucking-lations, Steven: Round One, you win.
Really? Well, let it rip.
I mean, did she stage it all for you and then go hide -- or did you just flat out kill the little bitch --
-- oh, for chrissake, that's a given; we all know that knocking me off is the bottom line here --
You didn't think to ask?
I was in the middle of --
Please! Something! Oh-God!
Jennifer-Jenzen-Executive-V.P.- Paragon-Pictures.
What is it??
Then just wait -- maybe this whoever's got you next on the Asylum's equipment- test list. Maybe a literal mind-blow inside the "Saturation Chamber."
-- it wasn't me.
It works.
Won't do any good.
Ghosts killed your father?
Keep talking, I'll find you!
Something....happened --
-- I'm coming --
What's the matter?
What will they tell you?
I have to admit you really have a beautiful home.
Well, I guess this whole thing was as strange for you as it was for us.
Did you find her?!
Honey, isn't your friend's name Colleen?
My angel!
Your father doesn't love us anymore!
She says she's lonely...
Where is she?
She's down.  Help her...
He's blessing the house.
Look daddy!  It's empty!
Yeah I'll look into that tonight.
Who knows...  we have to get used to living around here.  Maybe good help is hard to find.
It's just going to take a while.
What?
Weird sounds, things moving, lights going off.  The videotape...
But do you agree with me?
Whoa there...
You know, I was thinking... All that stuff father Seamus said...about discord, distrust... we're doing all right, aren't we?  You don't have any doubts about me, do you?
We're not going.
You're bleeding.
Not at all.  I'm just trying to put together all the evidence, to determine what it could possibly be.
What do you mean, unfortunately?
Where is your daughter?  She might be able to give us some information.
Maura.
Now you must listen to me. This force is like a parasite, or a virus. It feeds on doubt, suspicion, discord... you must clear your mind as we reach out for her.
I hope everything works out for you, and you find happiness in your new home.
Thank you.
There's something through that wall!
Well what is it!
What do you mean?
OK.  Be careful.  And lighten up.  Story of your life could be right round the corner.
He'll do what he does best.  But he'll do it unfettered.  He wants to walk the Earth forever, indulging his taste for all the myriad subtleties of human suffering.
Joey, you walked through your window from one reality to another.  You're stronger than you think.
So where is it?
It was off the statue.  In the club.
Right ... So ... Well, what do you want?
I want to talk to you.  We met ... now, listen, don't hang up, OK? ... We met at the hospital last night.
... well, I've been having it for years. It's not a nightmare or anything.  It's ... well, I know what it is.
No.  I'd seen him in there a few times before.  He was just a punk.  I'd never like danced with him or anything. Anyway, he was a thief.  He must've taken it from the statue.
I'll do it!
Yeah.  I found it.  I knew held like it and I figured ...
Everything sold as is.  No guarantees. No returns.
The barman?  I thought he was called Rick?
It doesn't bother me.  I'm just not interested.
You shit.  Who do you think you are?
I'm JP Monroe, you stupid little bitch. Now get the fuck out of my life.
Live and in the flesh.  How're you doing, babe?
Yeah really.  I'm ...
You're saying you want us to beat them to the crystal and save the world from financial disarray.
Delivery Entrance.  Low Security.
Not anymore.  Now I'm the laziest damn cat burg--I'm going to take it so straight that I won't tape a Mets game without the expressed written consent of the National Baseball League.
Come on, Alex, let's just get to Alex's.  Your bar's the only place that's going to cheer me. God, I'd kill for a damn cappuccino.  What the hell's a Nintendo?
So Mr. Coffee, what went down outside the prison?
It's Captain Bob's steering wheel! Remember when the Captain.....
"A mule is an animal with long funny ears."
Oh, not much.  Gates just had his tonsils taken out.  The hard way.
You re not thinking of going to...
We're going in from the ground floor.
Why not just go now?
Now that's a lock.
Ta ta, Hudson Hawk.
My plan is just beginning.  I'll forgive you for denying me the pleasure of slaughtering my boorish employers, but I'm afraid the birth of the new British Empire can have no witnesses!
Did he mention the Mayflowers?
You got it.  Operation Deflower Mayflower is a bad joke and I'm the punchline.  I thought we were using the CIA to help us to get Mayflower, but really the CIA was using me to keep us away from Mayflower.
I'm going to find out.
I was the Warden?
Wow, you were "in the joint." "Doing hard time."  It's funny, but that excites me.  I seem to have a thing for sinners.
Hey now, outside of a very friendly dog this morning, it's been a slow decade.  I don't make love every ten years, I get a little cranky.
Selfish attitude?  I'm just some guy who wants a little nap and a cappuccino for when he wakes up, not too much foam...
Way to go, Anna.
I look at you Soviet people and I feel... pity... superiority.  Most of your life, your government has told you that Capitalism turns people into robots who'd rather eat microwave sushi, naked in the back of a Cadillac than hear the laughter of children.
Come to think of it there is a part of your body that you won't need for your next job...
All this trouble for a horsey. I may not know art, but I know what I like.
You certainly do.
And to think I thought you were Evil Incarnate in pumps.
We blow up space shuttles for breakfast.  You and your friend Alex would be a late afternoon Triscuit.
Snappy.
Nobody told me! Nobody told me! You sold all of our stock?
Sure, sure, we'd all be millionaires. There's no point in looking back. At the time, Stilson thought dumping our position would panic the market, further depress the stock -- then we'd buy it all back, and more of course, once it got cheap --
Ah keeps the ol' circle turning -- this ol' clock needs plenty o' care. Time is money, Miss Archuh, and money -- it drives that ol' global economy and keeps big Daddy Earth a-spinnin' on 'roun'. Ya see, without that capital fo'mation --
...But I guess you don't really know him any better than that board does, do ya, Miss Archuh?
I don't mean that! Why you pretendin' to be such a hard ol' sourpuss! Ain't never gonna make you happy! Never made Warin' happy.
I'm happy enough.
I'm telling you, Smitty, the board of Hudsucker is up to something --
He didn't offer you money.
Yeah, and I'll bet his initials are Sidney J. Mussburger!
-- A Muncie girl! Can you beat that!
The picture was fine! It's what that knuckle-headed dame wrote underneath! Of all the irresponsible... Amy, take this down: Dear Miss Archer. I call you 'Miss' because you seem to have 'missed' the boat completely on this one! How on earth would you know whether I'm an imbecile when you don't even have the guts to come in here and interview me man to man! No, change 'guts' to 'courage.' No, make it 'common decency.' These wild speculations about my intelligence --
Aww, naw, Amy, that won't be necessary. I shouldn't send it; she's just doing her job, I guess.
Yeah, you know, probably one of these fast-talking career gals, thinks she's one of the boys. Probably is one of the boys, if you know what I mean.
Maybe she puts her work ahead of her personal appearance.
Oh. Nothing, really, just... the more timid investors are no longer running for cover.
You don't say.
Norville, there really is something I have to tell you --
Your i --
Shutup! -- and don't think I haven't noticed how you've changed. I used to think you were a swell guy -- well, to be honest I thought you were an imbecile --
Now, Amy --
Barman! Set'm up, fella!
Phony, huh?
Sez who?
You can't print that!
I'm sure you do.
I want a martini! On this bar, right now! I've had a martini in every bar on the way down here, and I'm not about to --
You know what they're doin' now, Lou.
...It's the most beautiful t'ing I ever saw.
Well, I --
I understand if ya don't like the Buzz-Sucker! Just lemme keep my job, I'm prayin' to ya!
...Yeah, go ahead.
Good afternoon to ya, this is Norville Barnes --
...Well, I'm not sure where I --
At the Muncie College of Business Administration.
How's that, Sid?
Ten bucks says she's looking for a handout.
He don't look wise.
...adenoids.
Miss Jessica used to say this is the only way for a lady to break her fast -- in bed, with a lacy cushion to bank her head up. If you'd only seen her, Miss Connell. She looked so pretty.
You're single?
Very well.  That means that you have met all Mr. Holland's requirements.  Now, as to salary -- it's quite good -- two hundred dollars a month.
Thank you.  But who sits there? 
I don't know.  He spoke to me last night on the boat. I liked him very much.
What in the world are you talking about?  Six ounces -- ?
Listen, did I tell you that story about the little mule at the plantation -- the little mule and Clement?  Let me tell you.  It's one of the funniest stories --
It is not beautiful.
A figure of St. Sebastian.
You didn't find your patient so frightening in the daylight, did you?
I've never given it much thought.
Well, I had a good time up to a point.
It's always stood there, Miss Connell.  I can remember it in my grandfather's time and my father's. I'm afraid it will have to remain.
What you saw tonight -- two brothers at each other's throat and a woman driven mad by her own husband?  Do you love that?
You didn't drive her mad.
She was beautiful.
I can understand that.  Everyone feels that way about someone.
I remember words I said to Jessica - words mixed like to poison -- to hurt her, to madden her.
But I assure you, Father Walters, Miss Connell had no idea of the consequences when she went there.
Why?
That could be a serious accusation, Rand, if it weren't a foolish one.
Ben you know that's your territory - and I wouldn't dream to trespass - you're the expert. Hey, how do you think Paramount's gonna do with that Blatty novel, what's it called? The Exorcist?
Don't see how. I think the public's had its fill of this gangster stuff. No, trust me -- disaster pics. And air hockey.
Oh not again Elena! If we've got problems, why can't you just come out and talk about them.
You want to go?
No, I didn't mean to sound negative. It was -- But Ben.  What is going to happen with us? Have you --
See for yourself.
Listen, Elena, if you're gonna pull that passive aggressive stuff on me again --
Your unfaithfulness -- that's what I'm trying to talk about. Your unfaithfulness. Your betrayal. Your dalliance. And you won't do me the dignity of being up front about it.
You should probably get dressed. The boys will be home soon.
After the Thanksgiving I had, I need it. You having one?
What are you talking about?
Listen, Benjamin Hood. I have obligations that precede your... from before you showed up. One or two, you know, good-natured encounters, that doesn't mean I'm... I'm not just some toy for you. When I remembered some chores I wanted to get done before the party, I just did them, that's all, because I wanted to do them before I saw Jimmy.
What you been up to?
Your toes cold?
We don't have to always go to your club, dad.
Actually it's not about work, it's advice about --
-- 73
You want coffee or something?
That's fine. I wouldn't expect you to see it any other way.
You want to come in, get a cup of coffee -- warm up? I can either walk you home, or you could crash in the guest room.
Mikey Williams?
Please don't.
I suppose my reluctance was the group aspect of it -- I've never been much of a joiner, although I still consider myself a somewhat religious person --
My daughter. I haven't been on a bike for years.  When was the last time you rode a bike?
And you're still trying to get me into bed.
Waste not Master Hood -- that was $20 for the bag.
Paul, cancel your mental appointments, baby. What are you, like still stoned from last night?
Do what?
Everything's gonna freeze, the big freeze.
No!
If you liked Notes from Underground, you'll love The Idiot.
Frankie opens them with his teeth.
Yeah.
You know Libbets, I really feel, you know, like a real connection to you --
My what?
Right. Cool. So, how about we take a bath together?
They did it last year too. It's like traditional or something. They've got this humongoid Park Ave apartment and she just holes up there with a wad of cash.  Aren't the hugely wealthy sad?
Who said so?
Yeah?
I don't ever want to see you.
I'm sorry if I got you into trouble. Maybe we don't have to, you know... unless you really want to.
Charles. Have you been keeping out of my shit? Have you refrained from entering the sacred precincts of my room?
Charles, what time is it?
What time is it?
Right.
All my model planes.
Are you his girlfriend?
If it wasn't raining we could take him outside and blow him up.
Maybe you could drive him to Spencer's.
So far.
The bartender at Darrow's.  He was there Friday night.
This murder was in the papers, right?
It's okay.  Happened a long time ago.  He was killed in a fire.  In New Mexico.
I'm going back to the Lodge, Ellie. Still need to go through some of Kay Connell's school records.
Then change it.
I don't remember.
It's legitimate.
What about your shoulder?
Thanks.
He would have liked that.
What I saw?
What time was that?
Forget your pager?
What?
No way.
Looks like the natives are restless.
You don't have to be involved, Will.
She loved me.  She wanted to see me every night.
Friday night, at the party - what'd you fight about?
What kind of stuff?
I never met anyone from Seattle before.
I don't know.
What was it?
I said you're going to get a phone call.
Kay Connell had a signed copy of one of your books.
Yes.
Who made us what we are?
And perhaps this is the only real evil left...
The one who made you should have told you this. The one who left the old world for the new...
I was waiting for you...
If you say so. You are innocent.
We want no quarrel with him.
And the vampires of the Theatre?
I don't believe you. I do not have to read your soul to know that you lie.
Louis, they cannot be brought back. There are some things that are impossible, even for me.
What plans?
Louis, put me in my coffin...
But you never let me see you kill, Louis.
We're immortal. You've always known that.
Should we burn him? Bury him? What would he have liked, Louis?
I've seen enough of this! I loathe it!
Never.
Yes...
You have to ask me for this. You have to want it, do you hear me?
Let's call that a start.
You're the devil, aren't you? That's who you are.
Your perfect. Your bitter and you're strong.
The trick is not to think about it. See that one? The widow St. Clair? she had that gorgeous young fop murder her husband. She's perfect for you. Go ahead.
Read her thoughts.
They know about us. They see us dine on empty plates and drink from empty glasses.
The girl, Lestat -
Do what it is in your nature to do. And you will feel as you felt with that child in your arms.
Oh God Lestat. I felt peace. I felt an end to the craving.
Claudia! Don't do this thing!!!
Still beautiful Louis. You always were the strong one.
I tried...
Saw you in the street outside. You seemed interesting. Is this where you live?
We can't begin this way. Let me turn on the light.
Yes.
You found nothing?
You promise to care for her then?
You're in 201 and 202.
And, while you're here, our marginally trained, off-season staff of five will attend to your every need.
What the hell would you call this?
Stupid. Stupid.
Jeez, Ray, fourth and forty, throw the bomb.
Fish are all over the water...Come on, let us take a boat out.
I got work to do. Take the bake elsewhere.
No means yes.
Yes.
There's no way to lock it.
I don't know.
It was in a church...it was so real. I mean, I could feel his breath on me.
You've got a better chance of getting hit by lightning.
Julie? What's wrong?
No, no, no. This was really sweet...
No -- it's not that. It's...I'm just a little on edge. I'm really sorry.
What? What are you talking about? Where?
I don't think so. It's pretty crowded.
Okay, I just didn't wanna get my hair wet.
I used to be a lifeguard...I'd hate to have to blow my whistle.
Ahh, that feels great.
Mark in the Morning! Magic 96.7! Oh my God! I'm Karla. Karla Wilson.  Jules, it's Mark in the Morning.
Well, Karla, what're you doin' at home over the long fourth weekend?
Waaaaahhhhhhhhhh!
You stumbled into my hiding place.
Must have missed the sign.
You know, the greenhouse effect has caused the gulf stream to shift and almost every meteorological expert expects a dramatic increase in tropical depression --
All the more reason to watch him. He's had some wild notions lately.
If the wind shifts, if the sirocco blows -- the hot wind from the South -- all danger will be over in twenty-four hours.
I suppose you want to hear my prayer to Hermes.
Oh, no - it's too delicious! You're making it up!
Poor Cathy --
Has she spoken to you of her father and her mother?
What are you doing?
Thea -- you're hiding something. Why do you suddenly speak of your father? You told me once you had never seen him -- didn't know him --
What is it -- what are you talking about?
It was, the plague
What would I be thinking?
What if he is?
When I tell him that you're unfit to live a normal life with normal people - a cataleptic!
I don't really know where Thea comes from. The ViceConsul at Adrianople brought her to me..
What is her illness?
He hates all my race.
Well, you're begging, and that's a whole lot worse.
Get that ladder up here.
George . . .
Bert, now listen to me. Ernie, will you take me over to my mother's house? Bert, listen!  It's that fellow there  he says he's an angel  he's tried to hypnotize me.
Well, I guess they do those things. Well, I trust you had a good year.
Well, who are you, then?
Well, you look about like the kind of an angel I'd get. Sort of a fallen angel, aren't you? What happened to your wings?
I said I wish I'd never been born.
Well, that's the doggonedest thing . . . I haven't heard anything out of that ear since I was a kid. Must have been that jump in the cold water.
A boy?
It's a good face. I like it. I like George Bailey. Tell me, did he ever tell anyone about the pills?
Did he ever marry the girl? Did he ever go exploring?
Now, you've probably already guessed that George never leaves Bedford Falls.
The Adventures of Tom Sawyer.
Clarence, you do a good job with George Bailey, and you'll get your wings.
The Bailey Building and Loan. It was up there.
Will you try to get some sleep?
She's swell.
You want a martini?
Come on, George, let's hurry.
Hiya, Marty. Well, it's old home week.
What's that?
Two cents worth of shoelaces?
Good afternoon, Mr. Bailey.
Get a tray for these great big important simoleons.
Pop!
Just a minute  just a minute. Now, hold on, Mr. Potter. You're right when you say my father was no business man. I know that. Why he ever started this cheap, penny-ante Building and Loan, I'll never know. But neither you nor anybody else can say anything against his character, because his whole life was . . . Why, in the twenty-five years since he and Uncle Billy started this thing, he never once thought of himself. Isn't that right, Uncle Billy? He didn't save enough money to send Harry to school, let alone me. But he did help a few people get out of your slums, Mr. Potter. And what's wrong with that? Why . . . Here, you're all businessmen here. Doesn't it make them better citizens? Doesn't it make them better customers? You . . . you said . . . What'd you say just a minute ago? . . . They had to wait and save their money before they even ought to think of a decent home. Wait! Wait for what? Until their children grow up and leave them? Until they're so old and broken-down that they . . . Do you know how long it takes a working man to save five thousand dollars? Just remember this, Mr. Potter, that this rabble you're talking about . . . they do most of the working and paying and living and dying in this community. Well, is it too much to have them work and pay and live and die in a couple of decent rooms and a bath? Anyway, my father didn't think so. People were human beings to him, but to you, a warped, frustrated old man, they're cattle. Well, in my book he died a much richer man than you'll ever be!
Sure, sure, sure. You go on home and talk about it to your wife.
Yes, sir.
Well, what about all your other friends?
I have a big deal coming up that's going to make us all rich. George, you remember that night in Martini's bar when you told me you read someplace about making plastics out of soybeans?
You've passed me on the street almost every day.
Well, why don't you say it?
Your . . . your caboose, my lady.
Oh, no.
If I told you it might not come true.
It's all right. I thought you'd go back to New York like Sam and Ingie, and the rest of them.
Oh . . . yeah, yeah. That's all right.
The doctor? Was the doctor here?
Great!  Find one for me.
Wheee!  Faster!
Oh, shit.
It's okay, it's okay....
But the island!
We're carrying weight.
Want to talk about it?
We're hung up here.  Snagged.
N-o-o-o-o-o-o....
On your own time?
We got a helluva tide this month.
If there is, develop it!
I know just where to go.
The drugstore's closed?  What the hell time is it?
I'm going.
What about tennis?  Riding? fixing up old cars?  Bartending?
Pop....
I passed out, but I'm okay.
Dad, I'm sorry....
What's that supposed to mean?
Look at that:
But that's what we're here to find out, right?
Eat Cheerios.
Where's my day book?
Why don't you take a half day and clean this junk up?
Boat nut.  What is it about this place that makes everyone a freak for boating?
Careful.  What's wrong?
What's wrong?
I'll give notice.
We have to do something.
It's still a good idea.
Please, Larry -- there's good reason. Those water skiers....
Someone has to do something.
10-4, in a few minutes.  He's down checking a buoy in the Bay Channel.
10-4,   soon as I can raise him.
Last transmission said ten juve- niles.
That's what he said.
Mom, Michael won't talk to me.
Can I go swimming?
Is that me?
Seventeen.  She's a senior.
Waiting for Andy.
Ready?
Help!  Help!
That's a crock of shit.
Hurry, please.
Until we find something.
Power line.
Do I have to play with the little kids?
So?  So?
Why don't you take a rest, Brian?
It hasn't adjusted.
Don't feel bad.
You see the three-quarter socket?
Aren't you suiting up, mate?
Well, don't worry about your fiancee.  We'll watch over her.
Yeah.
Don't let him get you.  Just continue your patterns and pretend he's not around.
They're coming with us?
Look, Michael... you don't have to come.
What do I do now?
Make up your mind.
What mind?  If I had a mind, I'd never have let you talk me into this.
What's that?
Wouldn't this whole thing be a little safer in the daytime?
You want me to stay?
Finally.
I need more pressure in the shark tank.
Honey, what is it?
So?
How is he?
But you --
I want that shark, Kathryn.
I've handled sharks before. Bigger than this one.
Calvin, I insist I be allowed to capture it!
Three hundred million years of evolution have created the greatest butcher the world's ever known.
Shark bait.  Draws them over for closeups.
Let's hope he knows that.
You're supposed to film it, not turn it to hash!
So do I.  But for different reasons.
Some miss all their shots.
He's missing.
I'm Neo-Senephrened out.  Think I'm catching a cold.
... Massachussettans aren't.
I don't know, it depends.
I haven't seen that much, but so far it looks great.
Are you really?
Besides that.
You're not in the water.  You're in a gondola.
It's okay, Sean.
Hold still, damn it!
Ahhh, ahhh...
On monitor three.  Was a glimpse of something.
Yeah, well I didn't!
Buzz off.
That's impossible.
I know.  But we show it's not closing.
Come on, let's go.
Something wrong?
Tell Dad we're getting married in Las Vegas.  In one of those chapels.  He can meet us there.
She still talking to you?
Sure.
Daddy, why can't I...?
Yes, I did.
I bought him his first legal drink. He got so pissed that night....
My brain is shrinking.  There's only so much room.
What's wrong?  What happened?
I could use a half-dozen more arms ...I've only got two weeks to get this thing finished....
All he did was kiss me....
Whatever happens next.....
Michael!  This thing working?
Don't be late.
You're damn right I'm serious....
Nothing out of the ordinary....
Trying to write our report....
You looked just like your father... The first time the shark came to Amity....
Promise me you'll be all right....
Depends on where you want to go....
Got picked up by a tribe of head- hunters....
You promised me a drink....
The kind with an umbrella in it....
I have two right feet.
There must be plenty of women who would be glad to go....
Why?
You sure you don't need glasses?
It'll come for the plane.  It's attracted to metal.  The electro- magnetic impulse....
What say we get the hell out of here, Ellen Brody. ...
I want you to leave her alone.  I don't want you involving her in....
What do you deliver on all those charters you...?
Can't this thing go any faster?
You tagging them...?
He's just trying to keep you from disappearing up your own....
What for?  We've got a job to finish ...Why are you making the monitor?
When I signed on....
We've got a rare bird here, Michael. Great whites don't come to the Bahamas.  There's never been one down here before.  I'm not just going to let it swim away.
How long have you known Hoagie?
'A Moray eel....'
Don't be so down, man.  Money's gone...Shark's gone...We're back to conch...We've got it made....
Shove it....
Stop that!
You don't like my voice...?
If it works, if we can get it inside the bastard and set it off, it'll shock the hell out of it.  We'll need a slave switch to set it off. Pull the dry cell out of the radio.
I'll do it, Jake.
No way....
How much longer?  This is supposed to be your party.
More beautiful with each passing minute...
Where's Lenny?
Did you like that, Mama?
Oh, no. I wouldn't go ...
Only me and Mom ..
I dunno .. Guess the dozer musta shifted him? You need some hands up here to look ..
No, Sir. I haven't started till Monday. I'm a "tourist."
Mr Blattis, of our local news- paper. You sure it's a suicide?
Not for me ..
Not today .. I'm on a diet to- day .. I'll take a diet soda ..
There's nothing in the files?
This looks promising .. I think this one could be it?
How come the F.B.I. don't put anya this together? They work- ed over "Jennifer" for months?
That isn't what you said before.
Hey, John, don't start getting antsy over this tonight. It may well have been the local cops?
Jesus. What are you doin?
What exactly you doing, John?
I guess by the bed.
Bits.
Have you got a match on the bullet?
Have you got a print from the hand?
Once.
You ain't talking to no one, till you calm down.
My pleasure .. Who's Popeye?
Is there anything else you can tell me? Anything about him or her? Doesn't matter how small?
What color was it?
No, just a minute or two .. I knocked on your door - no one home, so I followed the music ..
Well, I'm glad we got the conver- sational side of lunch over with.
You just asked me to ask you questions.
Really? What did he say?
Coz he thinks you're a witness.
You do?
Interview over, Blattis ...
When did John divorce?
I haven't worn heels since I was 16. I don't think I could walk in these?
So tonight she confesses?
Hey, we're not talking "talk" tonight.
Ugh!
Good.  They're all heatseekers!  All of them, everybody. You keep one superstar and they'll all follow. There's no real loyalty, and the first person who told me that, Jerry Maguire, was you.
That's right.
What do I do?  How do I spin this?
This is fuckin Michael Jordan, man! They should be screaming.
Airight.  Enough.  I'm pulling him out of this.  This isn't what I had in mind anyway.
Oh no.
No, that's fine.  What calls came in today?
Oh my God.
Don't worry about me.  I can get jobs --
I mean, the other night was... I felt like you understood something I could barely even say, something way down deep in the murk --  -- but we have a company here to think about.  I won't ever take advantage of you in that way again.
Oh good.
We'll see you soon, honey. Bye.
Same to you.
Right.  I'll come in.
I heard.
No, Roy.  I'm not gonna cry.
Oh, thank you.
Hey, I'm learning as I go.
Well, boo-fucking-hoo.
Did you tell him about the "ten million for four years?"
That's your word?
Oh, we gonna be friends now?
No.  A real man does not shoplift the "pooty" from a single mom.
Why are you doing this to me, Rod?
Tell me, and then you can sleep.
Exactly.  And the world does not need another 35 year-old bachelor. I knew I wanted to propose, so I took her there.
You okay?
Funny.
Show me the animal, Jerry!
Oh, my God.
He says it's a bad idea!
Twenty, twenty-fire pounds. I've been swimming at the Y.
Fine...and when the Tricyclatops comes after you, don't come crying to me.
What did you say?
Nothing.
Going to the coast was Alan's idea. If he's alive, thats where he's headed.
PAUL!
I know. I know. I want to look for him too.
Let me tell you a few things about you Dad, okay? He's very very very clever, very very brave, and he loves you ever very much.
How was your trip? Profitable?
Found this, but the battery's dead.
Know what this is?
Well sir, I am a great admirer of yours, and I have an extremely interesting proposition to discuss. Would you let my wife and I take you to have dinner tonight? Our treat.
What the hell is going on? What are they doing?
Dr. Grant, we're not leaving without our son.
Well that's good.
How did you know?
Just a little bit too much, I think.
Former academic.  Now I actually make things.  I don't just talk.
Resentful.
No, no, no, no, no, no . . .
Well, I do, and she's fantastic. She'll take you to the museum, maybe to a movie if you play your cards right.  You're going to have a fantastic time.
I can't tell you.  But I'll be back within a week.
Very hurtful.  Your mother tell you to say that?
Which one?
You know, at the bus stop.  With the hair?
You rally think this'll draw the parent?
I once saw a bull elephant die charging a jeep.  All the jeep had done was startle the bull's calves. I saw a lioness carry wounded prey four and a half miles, all the way back to its den, just to teach its cubs how to finish off a kill.
You cost me my livelihood.  That on which I relied to support my children.
Why did you come here?
It has to be temporary, something that'll break apart and fall off as the animal grows...
You know, even if we do get those tapes back, people are going to say it's just another hoax.  Ian Malcolm's alien autopsy.
WHAT ARE YOU-
So how much for our first tour.  Two no-shows and one sick triceratops.
How many lines of code are there?
But would we get the phones back?
How long will this take?
Oh, I'll get 'em all.
Yours was fully illustrated, honey.
These are dilated.  Take a look.
Are you sure?
Malcolm's okay for now.  I gave him a shot of morphine.
But you know, I should  really be the one going .
Yeah, I know, you know...kids.  You want to have one of those?
They know very little about the Jurassic Period they know less about the Cretaceous.
- - like birds.  What happen is, they swallow the stones and hold them in a muscular sack in their stomachs - -
- - which is called a gizzard, and it helps them mash their food, but what happens after a while - -
- - barfs them up - -
And scary.
When people try to control things that it's out of their power - -
Uh - - thumb!  The same way.
Microscopic - - never repeat, and vastly affect the outcome.  That's what?
Unpredictability....
Hola, Juanito
He had to leave early to be with his daughter.  She's getting a divorce.
Up and down, up and down!
The full fifty mile of perimeter fence are in place?
Tim.
Take a bite, take a bite.  I'm not letting go.
Why?
What's to be scared about?  It's just a little hiccup in the power.
Where does he think he's going?
You're sure?!
Not just kids - - for everyone.  We're going to open next year.  Unless the lawyers kill me first.  I don't care for lawyers.  You?
What kind of opinions?
Can't you stop these things?!
Dad - - Dad - -
Please!
You're gonna get electrocuted  electrified!
John doesn't subscribe to Chaos, particularly what it has to say about his little science project!
A load, if I may say so. of fashionable number crunching, thats all it is!
Why didn't I build in Orlando?
I'll keep an eye on it.  Maybe it'll swing south like the last one.
Robert - - I wonder if perhaps you would be kind  good enough to take a gas jeep and bring back my grandchildren.
I'm a hacker!
Beautiful trees... sturdy trunks... lots of branches...  We can do some great logging up here.
Logging? We'll need an environmental impact study for that...
Just a deer, Mister Biller. Part of the local wildlife.
Okay... well... I think it's this way...
Oh my god... this is his house... _we're in his fucking house_...
Quite a circus.
I can't wait to hear your opening argument.	"Ladies and Gentlemen	of the Jury... the Defense will prove that Jason Voorhees did not kill all of these people. They, in fact, committed mass suicide and then buried themselves in his back yard..."
Your... client is being booked right now. He'll be in cell five.
Now... I think the video store's open for another couple of hours. Let's go.
Doesnit sleep?
Oh?
Nurses. That's why I went into medicine.
None of that's true?
Insomnolesence...
Insomnolesence has been known to cause psychotic episodes... delusions...
Fascinating.
See this?
I don't suppose I can go back to the University and chase young coeds again... pretend this whole thing never happened...
You're not going to be there?
What happened? Where's Jason?
My assistants, I presume.
Where do you get your ideas?  Only joking -- I'm just joking.  Let's go to a brothel then, Kafka, come on.
Another one?
He has it, he just hasn't noticed it yet, all right?
In an organization as efficient as ours, if a document once in a great while gets lost it might never be found at all.
But <u>I'm</u> the messenger.  An error like this damages my credibility.
Are you looking for Gabriela Rossmann?
You're just doing your job.
I understand you fancy yourself an author.
Oh -- well, I thought he once mentioned --
What?
Do you think people in the New Town care what happens over here?  This will always be the ghetto.
There are some people I'd like you to meet.  Can you come to the Musil district at eight o'clock?
I've hardly published enough for anyone to draw conclusions from.
I'm collecting Eduard's things. If there's anything you want, take it or I'll give it to charity.
He used to like me -- very much more than I liked him.
I've heard of it happening.
I know there is.  And you're what I have to bargain with. For now you're the last one in their way.
I know better than you what people will say when they have to.  When they brought me in for questioning I informed on my friends the very first day.
Can I ask -- how you found me?
I don't think he really had any. He had no family either.
What makes you think so?
What's the matter with you?
My assistants.  I should have known. Nothing is given to me.  I have to acquire everything.
-- You said so yourself the firm is large and powerful.  If the discrepancy really was something big, Eduard's responsibility would still have to be small.  No poor young <u>clerk</u> could find himself in such a fix.
... A piece of paper ...
Through a very unfortunate -- and I might add extremely rare -- mishap, a document intended for the one department was sent to the other.  And for the first time -- though your friend wasn't aware of it -- two and two could have been put together to make one.
This is the cross-reference of clerks who've worked on Orlac claims?
We used to be in the supply section, carrying boxes of medicine about but we dropped too many of them.
Amerika for us!
Where do I charter a boat?
I don't know what happened to you, Jack ... but I can't believe you were always this much of a bastard.
There's a light up ahead.
Jack!
Barricade the gates! Quick!
Look, I've sailed these waters for twenty-seven years ... there's no island like that around here.
What a climax to the film - The first white men to set foot on ...  "Skull Island"  Twentieth Century man comes face to face with a ... a ... naked stone age tribe!
There's no island there. We're wasting our time!
We offer ourselves at your service, Mr Denham!
Tell me Mr Ginting - are there any parts of your country where people still wear ... native costume?
We are a very modest and deeply religious people, Mr Denham.
Man Eater!!!
Arlyn, just tell me, did Jane have a dumper, one of her regular Johns?
Why? She's a junkie.
Not young; he wasn't young -- gray at the temples, he -- well actually he looked like you.
Look -- could I use your phone?
Yes indeed.
You said someone killed them, you said you know who, you said that.
No, that's not --
Like for you to look for the man.
Yes -- all right --
Yes -- Jane McKenna's book -- I could make a phone call.
What is it?
And you just want to ask me a few questions?
No, I'm look --
What?  What do you remember about that -- dumper?
I thought you could trick me for those tapes. Don't you get lonely in that little green room? Or let me get you someone; I have terrific friends, wild.
Maybe, if you tell me the things you haven't.
Oh golly, oh just what I've always dreamed of, dirty phone calls.  How come?
Well --
Mm.
Thanks.
Frankie kept them in the same apartment: it cut his travel-time.
Arlyn had a very big habit - heroin - she's the one who started Frank. She's strung out now; you won't find her.
What's the matter?
Spangler says we have a relationship.
With Trina.
Bree, what's actually happened? It wasn't that bad.
I better keep looking.
Where, how?
I'm flying back out to Pennsylvania Friday; I'll fill them in on things.
Sorry we had to meet here. But I'm pressed for time.
Someone's been doing all these things.
Call-girls generally keep a book, you know, a list of their clients. Sometimes, if a girl retires, she'll even sell it worth good money. Jane McKenna had a black book; when she died it was stolen. I've been after it a long time.
I can't follow you.
Just send me a money order.
John, how are you?
Have you discussed this with them?
It's in the report.
I wanted to give it to you first.
Thank you. Goodbye, John.
I've just got a few --
You don't tell them. That one of their own in-laws laid a dumper on them?  Peace in the family.  Beyond that, I don't know. All she wrote.
Has she talked with you since prison?
We grew up together. Kids.
Did he recently appear to you agitated or depressed?  -- indicates no -- Did he voice to you grievance or discontent with his research work here? Indicates no. Moral or sexual problems or peculiarities? --
Sounds to me you better shake him again. Put him in a spot he has to do something more -- but this time give him a time and a place to do it.
Well?
Yes sir, we know he --
I'm Dr. Alvarez, Judge Atkins asked me to look in on your son and prepare an evaluation sheet.
Not particularly.
I see you have people there. What are their names?
Wow!  French toast, really?
Mom, I mean dad...
Uh huh...
That's terrific.  That's really terrific, but I notice I'm the one that's cleaning up this--  Oh, crap, I'll have to do this one over.
Look, I'm sorry I yelled, okay?
You don't hate it.  We had Salisbury steak last week and you liked it fine.
See.  That's my name.
I guess about the same kind of things you do.
Did you watch "I Dream of Jeannie?"
Bigger than a principal.  The judge sits in robes in a big chair.. The judge has thought a lot about us, about you and me and your mom, and he has decided...  ...he has decided that it would be best for you to live with your mom Joanna in her apartment.  And I'm very lucky.  Because even though you'll live with your mom Joanna I'll get to see you once a week for dinner and a couple of weekends a month.
I do not, your honor, however--
And would you describe those years as happy?
The first couple, yes, but after that it became increasingly difficult.
Mrs. Kramer, do you love your child?
There might be something at J. Walter Thompson.  But...  ...I don't think they're really serious.  The position's been open for two months and...  They may just be on a fishing expedition.  I'm sure you'll be much happier if you wait until after the first--
Did your husband strike or physically abuse his child in any way?
I don't recall.
My American Express...My Bloomingdale's Credit Card... My check book--
Okay, okay...What is it this time? What did I do now?...
Ted, you're not listening to me. It's over, finished.
Ted, I can't...I tried...I really tried but...I just can't hack it anymore...
Hello, Ted.  You look well.
Ted, all my life I'd either been somebody's daughter or somebody's wife, or somebody else's mother. Then all of a sudden, I was a thirty-two-year-old, highly neurotic woman who had just walked out on her husband and child.  I went to California because that was about as far away as I could get.  Only... I guess it wasn't far enough. So I started going to a shrink.  Ted, I've had time to think. I've been through some changes. I've learned a lot about myself.
Ted, when we got married it was because I was twenty-seven years old and I thought I should get married and...when I had Billy it was because I thought I should have a baby...and I guess all I did was mess up my life and your life and--
Okay...I think I'll go talk to my son now.  How do I look?
What the hell is this?
All right, Jim.  You said I was running this show, right? You said no decisions without my approval, right?  Well what the hell is this? What's going on, Jim?
Yes, what?
O'Connor's out to get you.  He's going to take the Fire and Ice account away from you.
So...what's so terrible about that?
And?
The judge went for motherhood straight down the line.
I lost him?  I lost him?
I'll take my chances.
Mrs. Phillips, how long have you known Ted Kramer?
Y'know something Thelma--you are the typhoid Mary of divorce. I mean it.  Joanna and I never had any trouble until you and Charley split up.
I mean, what are you going to do about Billy?
Thelma, I've lost my wife, I'm not losing my child.
You're on your own, understand?
Three.  And add some basil.
D'you think you and Charley'll ever get back together again?
She ever ask about me?
Uh, huh...
All quiet?
Again?
We are simply respecting the terms of the Seventeen Point Agreement.
Did you receive the letter?
Cow.
Is that big?
What can I do? I am only a boy.
And, America?
Where is that?
Shall we consult the protective deities, Holiness?
The pursuit of non-violence. Very difficult.
I will not go.
Good day.
I am happy to hear you say this, Chairman Mao. I have created a reform committee to investigate grievances and we have abolished Inherited Tax, and forgiven all money owed the Government by people who are unable to pay.
I turn you over again, today, Lhamo. One day, you will not be able to come running to us.
And after the game, we're going to trade. You just stay over there, no, there!, Norbu, and I will shoot at you. I want your land. I take it. I am stronger.
Is that true or pretend?
Yes.
This is Britain.
This is Tibet. And this is China.
No, Holiness.
Am I running away?
We have.
Tell me.
You are in great danger. The Dalai Lama cannot fall into Chinese hands. You must flee.
Hmm.
We won't let him get hurt, Ma'am.
Oh, but you <u>have</u>, Ma'am.  You lied to us, that could be obstruction of justice.  A man's been killed in part 'cause of your silence, I could make out a charge of reckless endangerment and I'm sure PETA would be annoyed at how you treat your cows.
You're to wait right here until the police show, you're under full house arrest.
And you like me.
I do <u>not</u> like you.
I'm laying a spring trap!
Again.  Not to be disruptive.  Do we have a problem with it dying?
Is this a trick?
Yup.
Asia?  How... how could he get here?
Maybe he doesn't play well with others.
Sobek.  Half man, half croc, oldest God--
I'm tired, Hector.  I know this because you're beginning to not bug me.
That <u>sounds</u> good but underneath it's hurtful.  Nightcap?
Where is he?!
So maybe Wildlife will try to save him, they're more equipped to--
I got something on the screen.
She didn't tell us about the other croc 'cause she was afraid we'd blow it's head off.
I never had sex with you!
<u>Jack</u>!
Nothing's real.
I'm an empty man, Kelly, wealth has robbed me of the dream in life, I sit here broken, a hollow sack--
No.
It really is beautiful, isn't it?
So I don't like tents, why--
Same thing from Fish And Game.
Baby crocs?
If one could be out there... why does Fish And Game tell me it's impossible?
Excuse me?
Gee, that was so poetic, Jack.  I'm all moist.
I wonder if he's some kind of mutant.  That bear had to be surprised.
Really--
Watch out!!
Yeah, I thought about that as I was driving... and... I haven't found somebody in my world.  You found anyone in yours?
Are they feeding?
You said nobody came in here!
They won't be here till at least noon.  We got a few hours to kill.
Now I'm gonna puke.
Even if we <u>could</u> tranq him-- how would we get him on land.
The lake was dead calm until up he came.  The tooth is in there.
Seconds.  Three, four.
You have a thing against museums?
You threw it at me!!
What was that?
Are you okay?
Kevin.  How's it going, what's happenin', family good, great, nice to catch up, get out.
Kelly--
<u>You</u>?
What'd I do?
No. He won't come after me.
'Cause she didn't drift. He weighted her down.
Where?
Sometimes.
FBI, Catherine, you're safe.
NOOOOO! You fucking bitch don't you LEAVE ME down here, DON'T YOU - YOU
Jack Gordon.
Are they close to catching somebody, do you think?
We're trying to interview all of the serial killers now in custody, for a psychobehavioral profile. Could be a big help in unsolved cases. Most of them have been happy to talk to us. They have a compulsion to boast, these people... Do you spook easily, Starling?
Yes sir.
Blue square for Belvedere, Ohio, where the Bimmel girl was abducted. Blue triangle where her body was found - down here in Missouri. Same marks for the other four girls, in different colors. This new one, today... washed up here.  Elk River, in West Virginia, about six miles below U.S. 79. Real boonies.
Talk about him, Starling. Tell me what you see.
Are you finished?
When I told that sheriff we shouldn't talk in front of a woman, that really burned you, didn't it?  That was just smoke, Starling, I had to get rid of him. You did well in there.
You heard them. I don't have that authority anymore.
That's why they're all so big - because he needs a lot of skin! He keeps them alive to starve them awhile - to loosen their skin, so that -
Sir, that's great news. But how -
Yes.
Maybe they'll catch up.
Five... so far.
It excites him. Most serial killers keep some sort of trophies.
And the questionnaire...?
How did -  It's nothing. A scratch.
I might if I saw the case file. You could get that for me.
I don't know. Next time I'll have to check.
"Plum Island Animal Disease Research Center." Sounds charming.
He was a town marshal... one night he surprised two burglars, coming out the back of a drugstore... They shot him.
The significance of the moth is change. Caterpillar into cocoon into beauty... Billy wants to change, too, Clarice. But there's the problem of his size, you see. Even if he were a woman, he'd have to be a big one...
After your father's death, you were orphaned. What happened next?  I don't imagine the answer's on those second-rate shoes, Clarice.
He kills w-
I heard a strange sound...
Thank you, Clarice.
Yes. I'll tell you.
Starling.
Look... search your own records, if you prefer. You can do it a lot faster than us, anyway. If we find Buffalo Bill through your information, I'll suppress it. Nobody has to know this hospital cooperated.
It may be that - I could confer with my colleagues on this. And get back to you.
I won't waste your time and Catherine's time bargaining for petty privileges. Clarice Starling and that awful Jack Crawford have wasted far too much already. I only pray they haven't doomed the poor girl... Let me help you now, and I'll trust you when it's all over.
Yes... I did.
Senator Martin...! You can't trust Jack Crawford or Clarice Starling. It's such a game with these people. They're determined to get the arrest for themselves. The "collar," I think they say.
Chingachgook. He warned me about people like you.
Yes. He said... "do not try to make them understand you."
What?!
In your particular case, miss, I would make some allowance...
They buried my ma & pa and my sisters. And Chingachgook - who found me with two French trappers - raised me up as his own.
My father sent Uncas & I to Reverend Wheelock's school when I was ten. So we would know both worlds... though we were told only bother learning readin' & arithmetic from yours.
In London those radical ideas could land you in Newgate prison.  Why were those people living in this defenseless place...?
Sorry to disappoint you...
Much further?
Mr Poe?
Told you to stay away from this hell hole!  Why did you disobey me?
"Justice"?  If that's "justice"..., then the sooner French guns blow the English army out of America, the better it will be for these people.
You do not know what you are saying!
Then what?
First place, you started it with the French over fur-trapping claims to the head waters of the Ohio.  Now you're sayin' these people have a fight on their hands...
Will you men help us stop the French?
That we did. John. But the horicane  is near trapped out.
Let the children of the dead Colonel Munro go free and take the fire out of the English anger over the murder of their helpless ones.
Our father, Montcalm, is greater than the Yengeese in the arts of war. The Huron do not fear English anger.
Easy for you to suppose. While it is their women and children, not yours, alone in their farms!
Webb's at Edward?
Not with enough certainty to outweigh British interests in this fort.
I have lived to see two things I never expected.  An Englishman afraid to support a friend. And a Frenchman too honest to profit by that advantage.
Sergeant! Form three ranks!
Advance, Sergeant Major!
"Magua understand paleface is a dog to his women.  When his women want to eat, he lay aside his tomahawk to feed their laziness."
Three, four oxen... much wampum.
Yes.
For Munro children?
I must receive proof more conclusive than Mr. Poe's opinion before I weaken our defenses by allowing militia to withdraw.
Chingachgook's of the same opinion. Taken together, that's gospel. Your fort will stand or fall depending on Webb and reinforcements, not these colonials' presence.
This interview's over! The militia stays!
That's where a lead bullet has torn you.
Please accept my compliments for the strong and skillful defense of your fortress. Under the command of a lesser man it would have fallen long ago given the superior numbers and material... mere chance has allowed me to array against you...
Honor that is freely accorded to courage, may be refused obstinacy... These hills afford to us every opportunity to reconnoiter your works and I am possibly as well acquainted with your weak condition as you are yourselves.  Is Webb really en route and Montcalm hopes to take the fort by duplicity before British reinforcements arrive?
The honors of war?
Le mot d'ordre?
La victoire.
These observers were doing something. A test...I think they sank that ship on purpose to cover up their mistakes.
Not exactly a big ocean country.
He don't need a readout, man, he needs help!
I've been looking at the duty roster...at the shack hours outstanding...
I thought they were your friends?
No way...
Think!  Can we stop it?! Block it up?!  Shut down the line somewhere?!  Think!
How do you know it was Williams?
You did good...
What?
There probably wasn't anything wrong with his suit...
That's great.  Now let's move 35 degrees southwest.
We're on backup air.
How much time does that give us?
What's your air reading?
Thank you, Martin.
What you don't understand is that my crew is in jeopardy.
Forty-eight hours!
Made your million, yet?
What the?...
So that's all you do?...
How'd you do that?
The monster appears to be a genetic aberration...
Who were you talking to?
It needs blood?
Tip top, Willie...tip top.
Who's the best power forward in the NBA...Jameson?
What's wrong, did you miss me?
I'll kill him!
The odds are one hundred to one so all we need is five grand.
He'll care all right. That was going to be his money. Whether he cares about us is different. Pass your phone.
No, I asked you to give me a refreshing drink. I wasn't expecting a fucking rainforest; you could fall in love with an orang-utan in that.
You want a pint, go to the pub.
I thought you said no staff, Bazza!
I don't know what you mean.
No mortgage, no debts; lock, stock, the sodding lot . . . don't worry, I got it under control.
The boys had 'em. I know you like these things; wondered if you wanted them?
Is that you, Dean?
Listen, I don't care who lives in there; all as I know it's got to be preferable to death by Hatchet.
Er well, yes we do.
The stupid bastards! Count it!
What's that idiot doing next door?  We use your van. It's up some stairs this place, so we'll stick out like balls on a bulldog. Plank is going up first. There is a cage but it is never locked, is it Plank?
It must be this one.
Willy, this is the last time, and don't let him know that you're here, otherwise he will be here all day, and get rid of him quick. We have work to do.
Where?
Who's this fat man, then?
What the hell are you doing here?
Tom?
What, and I care? Remember, you do have the luxurious advantage of being able to sustain your son's life.
I know.  Now shut it. You say a fucking word the right knee goes, another word then your left.
Never mind that now. I also need some artillery, you know, a couple of sawn-off shotguns.
If you will order stuff that comes from Kat-Man-Fucking-Du don't be surprised if your fruit picks up a few tourists en route. ~ Never mind that, what about the money?
Hold on, give us half a chance to count it.
How many feet?
You went out six hours ago to buy a money counter and you come back carrying two bags of fertilizer. Alarm bells are ringing, Willy.
Joanie Orozco's telling the whole school she's like desperately in love with Santo Guerra.
So I'm worried about you. I don't want you to end up in jail like your friends.
Don't try to con me, Amado. You knew how they got all those things.
You don't sound too enthusiastic.
Who's "they"?
Please.
Do whatever they tell you--
Yes, sir.
Everybody on the border knows that story.
So?
It's your deal. You sweated it out of him, you pick it up.
I'm not picking it up.
You ever shoot anybody was looking you in the eye?
Do I seem jumpy?
You look good--
You kind of bought yourself a pig in a poke, didn't you, Sam? All that time we were first seeing each other you didn't know I was tightly wound--
Colonel. Is uhm--is Otis in?
It's a small post and they're phasing it out in two years, but I moved up in rank and--well, a command is a command.
No sir.
He a Black man or an Indian?
I got a pretty good guess.
No sports if I don't keep a B average, no TV on school nights, no PDA's--
PDA?
These are our people. There were Paynes in Florida, Oklahoma, Piedras Negras--couple of 'em won the whatsit-- Congressional Medal Of Honor--
By blood you are. But blood only means what you let it.
Fine. I'm pretty much moved in.
Maybe we'll clean that thing out back up, have a barbecue next weekend. We could invite him and his wife over.
What?
It's a lead mine.
I don't know why I'm talking to you, you've got that thing on your head.
You going to get married?
You met her family? They gonna be cool about you being a white guy?
Her parents acted like I was gonna blow my nose on their curtains--
Seriously.
It's up or out these days, Cliff. Say I get transferred to a different post--
That ring--
There's not that much down here, Colonel. Big O's is the only place in the county that our African American soldiers are uhm--that they feel comfortable in.
It's a bar. People come together, drink, fall in love, fall out of love, air their grudges out--
So.
The Army hands you a command, you go wherever it is.
I haven't seen anybody doing that.
This same person been bragging all over the county how he don't have to cut that big gringo Sheriff in on it-- he can run his own operation 'thout any help. Como se llama, amigo?
You carryin' a firearm, son?  Don't lie to me now.
Quien es? [Who is it?]
Rapidamente! Everybody in the world is going to see!
Sam! I was just telling a few about your old man.
They just wanted it to be one of theirs--
Never heard from him again?
I always wondered what you Mayors do when you're not cutting ribbons.
Besides my father, I mean.
I got an idea what happened.
Fellas.
And the ten thousand?
The Perdido thing?
Steve?
Sure, they go back to Cortez. When he rode by, they were squatting in a hut cooking hamsters for dinner.
Well, you hire illegals--
Nobody is illegal in my cafe! They've got green cards, they've got relatives who were born here--if they only had a little common sense I'd be very happy.
Mami, how old were you when my father--
Maybe now. It was different back then. I had this place, I was doing all the shopping, all the cooking. What do I need some chulo with grease under his nails to drink up the profit?
What? Become a nun? You didn't want me going out with Anglos--
That's me.
Well, don't ever start up on 'em, cause once you do you can't stop. I tell myself I'm gonna play just three little games after breakfast, and here I sit with half the day gone.
Hollis probably told you we found Charley Wade.
Of course you can.
What's she singing about?
Can I get this?
Just 'cause you went to Catholic school and wore a uniform.
It can happen so sudden, can't it? Being left out on your own.
We thought we were something, didn't we?
Yeah.
Pilar--
Down from Houston. I think he knew the girl before.
I been working on a few things.
Yeah.
You think we need a new jail?
What's up?
Yeah. It's quiet--
He's gonna find out.
Thanks, Billy.
Right.
We've all of us waited too long to have the homecoming spoiled.
About?
I'll tell you.
Like the look of these?  I made them myself, to set him free.
Yes.  They weren't close, but they saw each other once in a while.  I think Philip believes all that stuff with the tarot cards.
And you don't ask questions?
When do you want me to start?
Oh Christ.
I was twelve.  Nix took me hostage, to get Swann to come to him.
Are you all right?
You can't.
Don't look.
Valentin?
Sure.
Are you saying that sometimes the miracles are real?
With what?
Whatever I said, I didn't mean it, okay?  I get a few drinks inside me --
I'm going back to New York in--  Shit!  I'm outta here.
You know of him?
What the fuck are you doing here?
Why'd you come here?
She doesn't want to see you. She's had enough pain.  Enough churning over the past.  She wants it all left alone.
Him too.
We've got to get you to a hospital.
Don't bother.
I'm sorry, D'Amour...
She has no real grip on reality.
You need an ambulance.
I'm not afraid to die.  There's something terrible... coming home...
Are they all in the business?
How the fuck do you do that?
Now I'm going to have to kill you.
I did it for Dorothea.
I don't know what else to do.
Oh Jeez.
Didn't know you read minds.
Oh, I was going to discover the secret of the universe.  That's why I liked Nix.  He promised me all these explanations.
No.  At the end... when we had him cornered, he got into my head. He showed me what we really look like, when the veneer's gone.  Jelly. Shit...
No.
... no...
Can you do it?
I don't want to think about it. If I think about it he'll hear me. He'll find me.
And he's dead?
Yes.
We're looking into it Bob, but they really want you to stay to do that talk show Friday, apparently it's a really big deal, he's the Johnny Carson of Japan.
Hello?
Yes... I don't know, I don't know her anymore. I don't know if you can be in love with one person the whole time. I was... actually I was in love with her sister first, when I was twenty-one. And one day her sister said to me she wanted to move to Paris, so I said okay, and she said no, she wanted to move to Paris with Francois,   and she's still married to him. And I moved in with Lydia... but I always really liked Lydia.
I'm not sure, yet... I graduated last spring.
Philosophy.
Ok.
I don't want to go home.
Charlotte, who?
Do you remember when we met at the bar? ...You were wearing a tuxedo.
No, for a candlelight dinner, yes, for her show.
You are.
Why do you have to be with your opposite, why cant similar people be together?
Where's your husband?
Do you ever see him?
That's what you said the other night.
Uh, yeah... I'll bring it down.
He was this fashion guy, and there were all these Japanese fashion people- it's a whole other world, and I was talking to these Japanese surfers... He was playing all this great music- I have to find out what it was...
Is there anything I can do?
Alright?
It's Lydia, your wife.
I couldn't hear you. How are you?
It's ok.
Ok, well, travel safely. See you soon.
Hello?
No, what are you talking about.
Oh, the record company sent these...
John! What are you doing here?
I'm just here shooting this band, what about you?
I can't believe it's already starting to get dark so early.
Hey, what are you doing here in the middle of the day?
Well, it shattered your faith in everything.
Must be a spare set.
She's been stalking you, Peter.
Sure it is.  If the guards did this, we can file charges.
You're aware that this woman was party to the so-called exorcism.
This patient has been plagued with temporal lobe seizures.
I've had it.  Townsend's dead.  The police are calling and now I see you having a scene in front of the children. I'm sorry, Maya, you've been with us for many years, but effective immediately, I'm rescinding your right to live at the church.
Father, I have nowhere else to stay.
But it's true.  I have no faith.  It's strange.  When that gun was pointed at my face tonight, I was surprised, but never frightened.  It was as if I knew nothing could possibly happen to me and...in that one moment I didn't care about anything.  Not eve my own life.
Peter.  Your life must matter to you because it matters to all of us who love you.
-- you wouldn't last five minutes.
Um hm.  That's right, Maya.
May I help you?
Yes... and you are?
And I also believe in God and the Devil. In fact, I know they exist.
What's that got to do with you?
I do.
I think you gave me the wrong one.
I had to.
Why did he try to kill me?
I'm not going to be drawn into this.
There's no reason why you should.  This has been planned from your birth. You fit all the criteria that we know of.  Never baptized, born of incest, devoid of faith...
Seven years.  One baptism?  He's your mother's only brother
What are you looking for exactly?
Why didn't you just go along with Townsend.  Get rid of me.  I would've...
What about after?
What did he say to you in French?
I think it's gonna be a waste of time.
Peter, you're now writing a book about the Viznick case.  You seem to be making a career of studying sensational murderers.  I have to ask, how does it make you feel when you sit in courtrooms day after day, face to face with alleged killers?
Well, George Viznick is in the grayest of gray areas in the sanity spectrum. Viznick is not psychotic. He's simply unable to submit to any higher authority.
Right.  If you believe in God.  As a narcissist, Viznick couldn't blame himself for the alleged murders.  He created the voices after the fact.  In order to avoid the simple truth that there is no outside force that guides George Viznick and that George Viznick needs to pay.
Mike.  Oh, the christening.  I meant to call...
What's this?
His mother had a cookout a few weeks ago. He could do a lot better if you ask me.
You're the one always turning your nose up at me.
Because you're pushing me to be something I'm not.
How is she alright looking the way she does?
Which one for tomorrow?
Are you okay?
We've got our final games against Oregon and Oregon State and I want to shake things up a bit, so I'm starting you at point again.
No, I mean I can check it for you.
Hello.
So how long is this trip?
Why not?
I don't know sometimes.
They ever love you back?
The coach from Tennessee was there and he has me riding the bench.
That tends to happen when you're the boss's daughter.
Yeah, four years ago.  They had me staying in this tiny-ass town with like fifty people.  I'm not playing, there was about a thousand goats running around, and it gets dark at four o'clock.  Then the whack club I'm on loses three games in a row and I get blamed.  So they fire me.
I don't care.
Well, if anybody bothers you, you could just tell me cause I run this street.
What do I have to do?
I guess, you know, we play ball and we ride to school together.  And if you get mad at me, I gotta give you flowers.
Man, forget you then, stupid.
Way to hoop.
A ride home.
Didn't know you cared so much.
So who you going to the dance with, Spalding?
See, that's why you ain't getting recruited.
Would you watch the damn road?
You having fun?
Yeah, the DJ's kinda whack, though.  So who is this clown?
Mulholland Drive.
What?
It was on my bed when I came in.  Can you just...?
What was that about?
It's okay, little baby.
Yeah, I hit a three at the buzzer.
What the hell's going on?
I just said I didn't fuck around.  But you got your head so far up your ass it took a cheap date for you to notice me.
No, it looks good.  I mean, it's cool.
Getting there.
I mean, Kyra hasn't heard the school thing yet.  She'll probably say it's the painkillers talking.
It's a trip, you know?  When you're a kid, you see the life you want, and it never crosses your mind that it's not gonna turn out that way.
What?
So you're gonna bitch up?
There's so many I just can't keep track.
Fine, then how many nights home is that?
What's that, not great?
Said he'd be home later.
Cause when you say can't, you ain't a man.
Yeah?  So you up for a game later?
You know, people.
Sorry.
Lucky kid.
And now I'm paying for it, right?  That what this is about?  "I told you so?"
Yeah.
No need for braces, Donnie.
You okay?  huh?  Jimmy?
It is.  Can I have your home phone number with area code?
Well can you connect me to someone else?
Well what's the situation?
Why don't they have the same last name? They don't have the same last name.
I know -- and I can't really explain that, but I have a feeling there's something, some situation between them, like they don't really know each other much or well, something like they don't talk much anymore --
Uh-huh.
Brain and Lung.
I'm not saying that, I'm sorry --
...Hello...?
OPEN THE DOOR.
For what?
Well if you keep listenin' to the music that loud you're not only gonna damage your ears but your neighbors ears.
About two years ago.
Yeah.
got some coffee brewing, huh?
You take cream or sugar?
That'd be fine.  So, Claudia, lemme just say, so I can get my role of LAPD officer out of the way before we enjoy our coffee  I'm not gonna write you up or anything, I'm not gonna give you a citation here -- but the real problem we have is that there are people around here, people that work from their homes, people tryin' to get some work done, and if you're listenin' to your music that loud:  They're incovenienced by that.  If you had a job you'd probably understand, but I see you like listenin' to your music and that's fine, you're just gonna wanna keep it down at a certain volume, maybe memorize what number you see on the dial and just always put it to that -- If it's the middle of the day -- that's what I do -- just put it on two and a half and that's a good listening level, alright? I see you like listenin' to your music loud, but, hey, forget about the neighbors, you end up damaging your own ears ok?
Yes.  I will.  It was nice to meet you Officer Jim.
You wanna go on a date with me?
No.
Yeah.
Why not?
ok.
...yeah...
Let's make a deal.
It's fine.
Well.
That felt good to do...to do what I wanted to do.
I'm really nervous that you're gonna hate me soon.  That you're gonna find stuff out about me and you're gonna hate me --
We're not gonna do that now.  We're not gonna do that now and that's over.
GIVE US YOUR MONEY, KID.
DAD --
Are you a joker? huh? Tellin' jokes?
Hey. Watch the mouth. Watch it.
Phil, hang in just one more minute ok?  I'm gonna put you on hold -- Doc you still there?
Well you lost me with the last couple of cocktail words spoken, m'boy, but I believe it's that sort of love. Sounds nice to me.
Brad, honey, you have a special secret crush over here I think, don't take him too lovely -- he might get hurt --
Brad, I know you don't love me now --
"It's a dangerous thing to confuse chidlren with angels..."
I don't have any money, Solomon. If you fire me --
I lent my name, my celebrity. Exactly --
Yes I do.
And how much is braces?
She's a good girl.  She's a little nuts, but she's a good girl I think. She's a little daffy.
I've seen it before.
I'll get you another pain pill. Another morphine pill --
I wanna see this...where is he, do you know?
Alright.  Thank you.
That's fine.  It's nice to meet you.
All it takes is one second?
-- see, I thought you grew up here in the valley --
-- that's right, that's right, and what I'M saying, that none of my competitors can say is this:  That there is no need for insight or understanding.  Things of the past! Gone, Over, Done. Do you realize how fucking miraculous this is? How fucking razor sharp and cutting edge and ahead of it's time this concept is?  I'm talking about eliminating <u>insight</u> and <u>understanding</u> as human values.  GOD DAMN I'M GOOD.  There is no need for INSIGHT.  There is no need for UNDERSTANDING.  I have found a way to take <u>any</u> subjective human experience -- in other words -- all the terrible shit or all the great shit that you've had happen to you in your life -- and quickly and easily transform it in the unconscious mind through the subtle and cunning use of language.  The "listener-patient"  settles into a very light, very delicate, conversationally induced state: NOT A TRANCE, mind you, but a STATE. A state that is brand new.  The System's state. What did I do?  I REALIZED that concept and put it into practical "get my dick hard and fuck it" use. I'm gonna build a state for the seducer and the seducee to live, vote, breath, pay takes and party 'till dawn.  I'm gonna teach methods of language that will help anyone get a piece of ass, tit and tail --
I warned you -- I get on a roll...
I would just want to clear some things up:
It's all important --
It's not like I'm trying to attack you --
We talked earlier about your mother. And we talked about your father and his death. And I don't want to be challenging or defeatist here, but I have to ask and I would want to clarify something -- something that I understand --
Does you mother still work?
"Go Get 'Em, Honey."
Do you have your masters?
Ok.  That's why.  I had trouble locating your school records at Berkely and UCLA. Your name change -- they had no official enrollment --
They wouldn't?
...are you Phil...?
Yeah let's...maybe just stand.
He's in here --?
...ok...
I am calm.
No.
You're my handsome man.
Will that help?
No one else that I know?
How long with Ellen?
Just once.
How long with Paula?
Do you feel better now that you've said this?
I don't know....
I really don't know.
I don't know what I've done.
I don't know what I've done.
I'm Bob.
Was it a call back?
If we beat the record, you might get a call back --
I'll get it because I'm a good actress, Richard.
What's MOW?
I don't want him to die, I didn't love him when we met, and I've done so many bad things to him that he doesn't know, things I want to confess to him, but now I do: I love him. I love him so much and I can't stand -- he's going.
This is not any fucking medication talking, this isn't -- I don't know. I don't know -- Can you give me nothing? You have power of attorney, can you see him, can you, in this final fucking moment, go see him and make sure --- change the fucking will -- I don't want any money, I couldn't live with myself, this thing I've done -- I've fucking done so many bad things -- I fucked around.  I fucked around on him, I fucking cheated on him, Alan. You're his lawyer, our laywer, THERE, I'm his wife, we are married. I broke the conract of marriage, I fucking cheated on him, many times over, I sucked other men's cocks and fuck - fuck - fuck - ....fuck.... Other Things I've Done..
Earl asked me, Linda, please, Linda, I'm sorry -- Earl asked me --
Partridge?
Ok. One of those. Do you have Ram Rod? The magazine, Ram Rod?
Stanley if you don't fuckin' stand up and go over there I'm gonna beat your ass --
Cmon,cmon,cmon, that one to?
You have to be nicer to me, Dad.
I think that you have to be nicer to me.
Hi.
Cause he hates me....he hates me so much.
I have money.
M'lady...?
I am preparing for a ball!
I wish to discuss your brother.
D'Artagnan, you will hunt down Aramis, Porthos and Athos, and bring me their heads, or I will have yours.  And as for you, Phillippe... Back to the prison you shall go, and into the mask you hate.
Your birthday celebration, your Majesty?
A body.
You seek facts, when it would be better to seek truth.
Hang himself?!
So what has changed?
You can't do it.
Be quiet, you fat fool.  Can't you see I'm praying?
Forgiveness.
The greatest secret of life is who we truly are.  Now I must give you that secret, which has been kept from you your whole life.  It began on the night when Louis was born.
Not just a baby, Porthos.  I carried the child of the king.
The child of the king is... the king.  Louis!
Do I look all right?
Mother's ring.  I can't take this.
We were at her door.  I was just taking the ring from my pocket, for the third time today, when a young Musketeer brought the invitation for her to become a lady-in-waiting for the Queen Mother.
Die?  What...?
I have rejoined the army, and asked to resume my commission at the head of the troops of General Fromberge.
I have ordered a drill of the Royal Guard for midnight, and must be clear-headed for it.
This cannot be.  Everyone knows the Queen Mother is a recluse, and the ladies-in-waiting are but mistresses for the king!
Raoul is everything to me.
An oath is an oath precisely because it cannot be removed!
You look so sad.  Is it something I have done?
This place... I once lived in a country house.  I had guardians -- an old man and woman.  And tutors. But no friends.  Then when I was twelve, they came and took me to the prison.
I just left the garden, it was empty.  What did you see?
I want all these passages sealed! Another stupid idea of my father's! Seal them all, every one!
What number did you tear out?
You are beautiful.  You know you are.
I will order a Mass for his soul. It will guarantee his place in Heaven.
Listen, my darling... Raoul was a... a good friend.  And now he is dead and that is very sad but --
Cooperate?
Why didn't you call for back-up! What were you thinking, Jesus!!!
I'll take the south end -
When did you join the force?  You know, the police force, the place you work...
Hell, he probably raped her in the lot, dumped the body somewhere. That's what he was like - a real wacko.
Now you listen to me hay-seed! If you don't want to spend a year in jail for making a false report you'll start giving me straight answers, you got that!!
You won't like this.  I ran the prints from the house.  No police record on your suspect--at least not in our files. But there is a match on the girl.
Where up north?
Seattle.
What's going on here?
I took it with me.  It's in a safe place.
What?
No...I'm in some trouble...
It's...it's a long story.  Can we meet somewhere?
You gotta turn yourself in. Before it's too late -
Who knows?  Maybe he's ordering army knives. I can't access that, but look what we have here...these are the account records for Fleming and Marvosa.
It's not very much to go on...is there anything else we can check?
It was you who did the asking.
He doesn't think you run mind games on him.
You're never alone in a room with Graham, are you? You're smooth about it, but you're never one-on-one with him. Why's that? Do you think he's psychic?
I'll tell you the events. The psychology's none of your business. Hobbs was trying to cut his eleven- year-old daughter's throat. Graham shot him with his .38 six times. Hobbs still didn't go down. He had to wade in...
It has to be a book the Tooth Fairy would know Lecktor has in his cell.
Where?
He thinks you want him to look at evidence.
Nobody's better with evidence. But he has the other thing, too. He doesn't like that part of it...
Somebody hurt him?
He is good. Bur not as good as Price.
We find an event that connects both families. Same vacation hotel; same hospital, different times. Then we check employees and come up with a male nurse, hairdresser, whatever...  If we find out how he found them, then we'll find him.
We know the Tooth Fairy reads the Tattler. The stuff about me and Lector? I don't know any other paper that carried it...
Tell me now.
I arranged for him to have a phone. I have to call him in a few minutes.
Something Lecktor said.
He asked for Will. He said he might call back tonight. I tried to hold him... I'm sorry... He said 'tell Graham "broken mirrors."'
Where the hell's Graham!
Can you give me an idea of the conditions...
When do you need it?
Thanks, but I'll take the bus. I do it all the time.
You worked out well.
Yes, are you okay...?!
Was I in an accident?
Burned? Burned. No. You just rest there. I'll be right back.
According to you I'm a sexual failure. An animal, you said.  You know now, don't you?
No. I don't want to see you.
Look at the screen. That is William Blake's 'The Great Red Dragon and The Woman Clothed with the Sun.'  Do you see?
'No' what?
Are you a man?
Yes.
Dr. Lecktor will stay in his room. That is absolutely the only place where he is not put in full body restraints. One wall of his room is a double barrier. I will have a chair put just outside.
It's Will Graham...
I'll bet she has a call caddy right next to her phone.
Now I'll bet it has his home address there, too
Do you know something about that?
Why do you think I called?
The report didn't mention nails and eyes.
Nine that we know of. Two didn't die.
I'm a forensic specialist, Molly. You've seen my diploma?  I got a diploma and everything.
What the hell can I do?
Hey, baby! Where are you?
I'm thinking about painting the kitchen. What color do you like, Will? Are you there?
He didn't know you had been in a mental institution. Be asked me if I knew. I said yes. I wanted to talk to him. He said he wanted to bring it up to you. Face to face.
Yes. Is Molly there?
Lt. Fisk said...
No, I'm okay. I just wanted to...  ...stop by and...
No. You're very well-protected.  No one can find our where you are.
We don't know that.
Did the girl die?
Dr. Bloom showed me your article on surgical addiction in the journal of Clinical Psychiatry.
It's about Atlanta and Birmingham.
You read about it, I'm sure.
In the papers. I don't tear out the articles.  I wouldn't want them to think I was dwelling on anything morbid. You want to know how he's choosing them, don't you?
Then how did you catch me, Will?
Big backyards, fences, some hedges, why?
When you do have one I'd like to hear it.
You should, Will. God's terrific!  He dropped a church roof on thirty- four of His worshippers in Texas last Wednesday night. Just as they were groveling to Him and singing a hymn.  Don't you think that felt good?  He wouldn't begrudge you two measly murders.
People love... comedians.
And this is a CLASS ACT!  It's the guys who did the Mary Tyler Moore and Bob Newhart shows!  It takes place in a taxi stand!  And you're gonna be the Fonzie!
"No"?  "No" to which part??
Andy!
The ONLY reason I did Taxi was so I could have my own Special!
Tell you what.  I'll book you on some concerts, and meanwhile, we'll show the Special around... see if somebody wants to buy it --
You signed for five years --  So four years, seven months.
They're having a laugh...
Maybe I can turn it into a bit.  I can go back on the show, and say it was rigged.  Demand a recount...
What was that all about?
You must take a little pleasure in it.
My hair is coming out.
Eh, I dunno... Andy.  I'm... thinkin' of letting you go...
Andy!
Twenty!
Andy, the theater's that way!
Hi...
Jesus, Andy!  Can they cure it?
They don't know... they've gotta run more tests.
Give me the book.
It's so dirty.
I, I was asked to do this material - -
And you say, "Santa, what am I gettin' for Christmas?"  And he says, "Cancer!"
Goals are important.
Excuse me, Andy...
Please!  You've GOT to let me take the classes!  It's how I keep myself BALANCED!!
Really?!  You want Tony Clifton to headline Harrah's Tahoe??
Hmph!  They sure didn't give Andy much to do.
Does that surprise you?  It was inevitable.
We'll need a search running.
You got the money?
Something wrong, man?  You look a little whiter than usual.
There's something about him, isn't there?
... Yeah.
I'm going to let you in on a little secret here.  Now don't tell him I told you this, but this ain't the first time Morpheus thought he found the One.
How many were there?
Good.  Now there is a window.  Open it.
They got to you first, but they've underestimated how important you are.  If they knew what I know, you would probably be dead.
Why not?
Have you ever had a dream, Neo, that you were so sure was real?
This can't be...
... am I dead?
A.I.?  You mean artificial intelligence?
No you don't.  Did you see the woman in the red dress?
And she's never wrong.
Yes I do.
I'm going to make the call.
So?  What do you think?  You think you're the One?
What's funny?
Trinity?  The Trinity?  The Trinity that cracked the I.R.S. Kansas City D-Base?
It's necessary, Neo.  For our protection.
E.M.P.  An electromagnetic pulse.
That the Matrix cannot tell you who you are.
Should I be?
Are you all right?
What happened?  What did you see?
How much like it?  Was it the same cat?
Is Morpheus alive?
What?
I'm coming with you.
No, you're not.
Do what?
Morning.  Did you sleep?
Where is it?
Operator.
You're going to kill him?  Kill Morpheus?!
Whether she wants to or not...she's not going.
No, all we got is $40.
It's an open ticket.  I can go anywhere up to $350.
Take it easy.  I only asked because maybe I could, you know, let you have a little something.
What do you mean?
I don't like loading crates.
What about your attitude...Where's your job...eh?  You talk and talk and I go to work...what do you do?
Charlie, you know the best way to take care of this whole mess.
What are you going to do?  Hide me?
OK, ok...
Michael, nobody's out to screw you, I guarrantee that.
Michael, believe me.  You know the kid's a little crazy sometimes.  I vouched for him and he'll come through.  I promise.  I'll talk to him and straighten him out.  Don't worry, OK?
Nothin'.  Just stiffed those kids. Don't want'em comin' back and findin' you...start asking you questions.
$20.
I'll tell you who you can pray for... Next payday, I'll be at Tony's Place...Johnny better show or I find him and break his legs...and I mean it.
He could at least show some respect and show his face, even if he doesn't have the money...
Fine.
Why not here...Ok nevermind...6th Avenue and Waverly.
About that shooting last night...I was there and...
Take a drink!
Well, he was always a little crazy... he puts a gun in his mouth...  ...like your friend...comme si chiama...Henning?  Heming?
...but it's the same thing, all the same...they're in there by having something on somebody...and when that doesn't work...they fight...Our life has honor...we have no show to put on because we do what we have to do.  They know where to come when they need us.  I realize this during the war...World War II...Vito Genovese... during WWII he worked with the government, taking care of the docks...
What do they expect you to say?
"Short Happy Life of Francis Macomber."
Charlie...?
You know...like restaurants, night clubs...
It's still sick.
Don't count it...it's all there.
and a double for you and Charlie here.  And put it on my tab, willya?
...We're never all together two nights in a row.  Maybe Christmas, Thanksgiving, that's it.  What's going on?
His wife?
That was 'Joe'.
Fireworks.  Update -- we're con- structing the number '65' on the barge, archers from the State College at New Paltz will shoot flaming arrows at it, when it catches fire it will give us the effect of a Viking funeral with none of the morbidity... The Hudson River Authority says, for you, they'll make a special dispensation - of course there'll be an overtime bill for the Poughkeepsie Fire Dept...
I lay awake nights in a cold sweat, I want this party to be like some- thing Mom would have made for you, I want it to be perfect --
From La Rosette, only the greatest pastry chef in America.  This is orange, from real Seville oranges.  Lemon, on a mille-feuille crust, a little on the fanciful. And a while, nothing like a good old white cake, vanilla, with Angel food but some maroons shavings thrown in.
It's starting to grow on me.  But what do the 'B' and 'P' mean?
-- The late harvest Riesling, Mr. Quince, a possibility for dessert.
...See you tomorrow night.
Well... goodnight.
And what would that be?
Cold.
Who are we talking about?
I'm not stepping anywhere --
In my sleep.
'Yes'.
...Tomorrow we sign off -- photo opportunity, you and Big John, it'll lead network news.  Okay so far?
Sounds good.
Our first annual report, must be thirty-five years ago now, I owned two stations, I wrote down a state- ment of purpose, that one day you would wake up to a Parrish radio station, read a Parrish paper at breakfast, catch our news on tele- vision during the day, and go to bed with one of our books or magazines and you would always be told the truth and in the bargain, have a good time.
What do you mean?
No --
Sorry.  I know it looks like I'm reversing my field.
Shall we adjourn?
Joe and I have no secrets from each other.
What is there to say?  They know what John Bontecou is -- and if they didn't, they know now.
The answer is no, quick enough for you?
In English, please.
Never mind Bontecou.  I've got some other merger possibilities up my sleeve, and I'm putting them to see old man.
'It's up to Joe'?  Those were his words?
I'm going to put a stop to this!
Yes.
Rass!
C'mon, have a drink.  You look like you need one bad as me.
Love.
Because there's nothing we don't know about each other and it's okay. I mean the deeper, darkest secrets -- they don't matter.
Susan?
I appreciate you --
No, I'm not.
Girlfriend?
He's taking a nap.
Don't.  That will come later.
'Love will find out the way'?
The 'coffee shop' --
I - uh --
No.
Thank you.  Would you like the man's name?
That's the best I can do.  ...but minute-by-minute, I find myself lingering.
Yes, Bill.
What I'm trying to say is this is a Board meeting and you are not a mem- ber of the Board.
Yes, I am.  There's a research lib- rary on the fourth floor.  Why don't you go down and read some magazines?
Truly - uh - splendid.
Okay.
I guess...
About Susan?
You tell me, Bill.
That's okay.
What's okay?
I couldn't sleep.
And I don't give a shit.
Uh --
It's time to put this person where he belongs.
Prepare yourself, Drew - I am --
Undisclosed conflict of interest --
Am I dreaming this?  Are you a dream?
You're not Death.  You're just a kid in a jacket and a pair of pants.
Excuse me?  Could I say something?
It just occurred to me --
'Yes' what?
It's enough now.
Where are you?
'The one' to do what?
What the hell are you talking about?
Thank you, Quince.
But I've got to tell you, if mergers are in the wild, I've got some great prospects I've developed.  I want to talk to you about them next week.
No, anything is possible.  It's up to Joe.
This is great, honey.  The orange. Has it got a little vodka in it? Like that Finnish stuff, orange vodka --  Put your lips around this one, Bill. It's out of this world.
Joe knew the whole story.  I told him.  It was his idea that I come clean.  I mean I wanted to come clean but he gave me a pair of balls, you know what I mean?
Good morning, Dad.
Drew told me.
I hope so.
...There's a start for a meeting.
You mean like you loved Mom?
Be deliriously happy.  Or at least leave yourself open to be.
I know it's a cornball thing but love is passion, obsession, someone you can't live without.  If you don't start with that, what are you going to end up with?  I say fall head over heels.  Find someone you can love like crazy and who'll love you the same way back.  And how do you find him?  Forget your head and listen to your heart.  I'm not hearing any heart.  Run the risk, if you get hurt, you'll come back.  Because, the truth is there is no sense living your life without this.  To make the journey and not fall deeply in love -- well, you haven't lived a life at all. You have to try.  Because if you haven't tried, you haven't lived.
What is it, Daddy --?
It'll come back, Daddy.
What a night.
If you don't mind dancing with an old fogey like me.
I was just being agreeable, now I've got to explain why?
I'm not trying to sharpshoot you, but that 'nothing lasts' stuff, that's what was the trouble with Honey's guy.  He was fooling around and Honey caught him at it.  One girlfriend wasn't enough for him.
Everybody's a doctor around here. This apartment house is all green pajamas and slippers.  The guy I'm waiting for to vacate is a doctor. What kind of doctor?
Yes, I could.  I have an office in the hospital.
I know what you're saying.  Doesn't pay very well.  Depends on the woman I marry.  Maybe she'd like a bigger house, a better car, lotsa kids, college doesn't come cheap --
I've been thinking... I don't want you to be my doctor.  Because I don't want you to examine me.
Why?
78.
Hiya.
Burt.
This isn't my room?
Why didn't you clean it out?					 *
So how many rooms am I checked into in this dump?
Leonard, it's Burt from the front desk.
I know you said you didn't want any calls...
A cop?
I haven't made a strong enough impression.
Jimmy?
Have I told you what this man did?				*
Then you shouldn't have to ask.
Calm down. You're not into anything. It was my problem, you offered no help. It's got nothing to do with your investigation.
How do I know he did that to you?
I know the feel of the world.  I know how this wood will sound when I knock.  I know how this glass will feel when I pick it up.  Certainties. You think it's knowledge, but it's a kind of memory, a kind you take for granted. I can remember so much.  I know the feel of the world,  and I know her.
I told him about your car.
How did they explain what you remembered? The gun and stuff?
Did Teddy send you?
You've read it a hundred times.
Yeah, but the pleasure of a book is in wanting to know what happens next -
That's who you were, you don't know who you are.
You said you were leaving town.
Guess I've told you about my condition.
You really want to find this guy?
You're living.
We can't just walk him out tied up and bleeding.
Shut it, Teddy.
Guys who'll come after her. Guys who'll want to know what happened to her boyfriend. They'll want to make somebody pay. Maybe she'll try and make it you.
Why?
The sort of questions you should be asking yourself.
How do you know him?
This is a drug deal?!
That's Sammy, not me! I told you about Sammy -
Sammy was a con man. A faker.
I never said he was faking! I never said that!
My wife wasn't diabetic.
Somehow, I'll know!
Why do you keep lying to me?					 *
Why would I do that?						    *
* Thank you.							    *
Turn around.
Just came in.  She's still alive.
We're not certain...
Sure.
So...?
Okay.  You got the "item"?
Okay.
Where's that?
Havana?  Cubans don't like us or my business...
Blanca...a rubio like you.  I see her in a dress...an old photograph from Lucinda somebody's wedding...everybody is with couples.  Husbands and wives.  They all pose.  My mother is alone because my father had to go back to the fighting.  ...she looks right into the camera. She is the most beautiful woman in the room.  By herself.  In a party dress.  And she looked like she knew she would die alone...  She spoke many languages.  We were in Luanda when she died.  I went to her friends in Mali.  They sent me to the Ecole Polytechnique in Geneva to study mathematics, where I met Montoya in the discos.  He had banking there...I was seventeen and very much into the clubs.  And he sent me to University for an MBA in Finance.  Your mother?
'Cause we <u>guarantee</u> every load.  Anywhere, for any reason, it comes up short, we make good.  Your operations will, from now on, run risk-free.
The range should be between fifteen and seventeen-point-five percent of the P.O.E....to even consider it.
I forgot the napkins.
Something like that.  The odds catch up with you.  The odds are like gravity.  You can't negotiate with them.  So...at some point, you should cash out, take your money and run...
This is the talk of a man...if he were your husband...he would never put you at risk.  He would never put you within a thousand miles of anything that could hurt you.
A few more moments, still in this business.  Then I'd find you.
No part of it wasn't real.
Sonny Burnett...this is my partner, Rico.
What'd Neptune tell you?
Backup in case the Russians get physical.
White gangs...?  It doesn't track.
No.
Where the hell are you, man?
You think I am in so deep I forgot?
If you see a few new faces, don't get jumpy...
Then you should.
Hello?
Okay.  What's up?
That's right.
"Hi, Gina.  Hi, Sonny."
Yeah.
Alonzo...!
Correct.  Flash samples.  Flash cash.
Haitian, Dominican, Russian, Israeli?
Break your encryption?  Hack your e- mail?  Employee databases? Somebody on the inside?
So?
You mean with the flowers...?
Precursor shipments from Ras Tanura and Ju'aymah?
I run down the numbers.  Nothing is very negotiable.  Small loads?  We pay three thousand a ki. We pay your fuel costs up front plus ten percent.  The next ten percent on U.S. landfall.
Meaning...?
You ain't coming to work?
What you gonna do back there, East?
Yeah, oh yeah.
He's got taxi fare.
Well, that's something never happened to me before, you can bet your bottom dollar. Uh, where's the matches, ma'am?
If you didn't talk so much, maybe you could think more.
That is one hell of a shirt. I bet you paid a pretty price for it, am I right?
You want some free medical advice, shut your goddam mouth about that night.
Listen, keep away from me, hear? You come near me again, I snatch you bald-headed!
I'm impressed. You're a killer.
The two basic items necessary to sustain life are sunshine and coconut milk. That's a known fact. If I can find the goddam hole the milk squirts out.
Miami Beach is the only place for a real hustler. Florida has more rich chicks per square yard than any resort spot in the world. They lie out in their pagodas and pergolas waiting to grab the first jockstrap that passes.
Look at yourself, Joe, no offense, but frankly, you're beginning to smell. For a stud in this town that's a handicap.
Shee-it. Cough yourself inside out, then light a fag, a goddam fag. You make me puke. Where'd you steal it? In the movies?
Well, I made it. This here is Ratso Rizzo and I...
I been thinking. I hope we're not gonna have a lotta trouble about my name down there. Because like what's the whole point of this trip anyway?
I'm wet.
I'm going to Florida.
But I'll bet you got one thing in common with them other boys. I'll bet you're lonesome.
I'm lonesome. I'm lonesome so I'm a drunk. I'm lonesome so I'm a dope fiend. I'm lonesome so I'm a thief, a fornicator, a whore-monger. Poop, I say, poop! I've heard it all and I'm sick of it, sick to death.
Lonesomeness is something you take. You bear? Dammit, you take it and go about your business, that's all.
Ready for hard work, son?
Sold. Let's go.
Looks like a cheap hotel.
...He had a bald skull and...
Where?
Bad. She couldn't make the trip. You know Her boy...  Susan told us before we got your letter. She's fine; she's trying to get the money to come back and see you, but...
DAD!
Not far. Just a little way.
Where are the minefields?
All over.  Turkish Army up there. It's against the law. They shoot us.  You sure you looking for your friends, man?
Four planes in four days...but I guess you kids don't read the newspapers...and what with our people kicking up a shit storm 'bout the flow of heroin from Turkey you got...
Well, you see Billy, it don't really matter right now if it's 2 kilos or 200 kilos. The Turks love to catch any foreigner smuggling - it shows the world they're fighting the drug trade.
Yeah. Parents, brother, sister. Babylon, Long Island.
How's it feel?
What they give you?
What time is it?
Cut his fucking throat.
Bad. Sent to the City Hospital. They ruptured his hernia again.
What'd the Prosecutor say?
Who got the Frenchman out?
Immigration's gonna love you for that.
What?
Oh, you helped me here, all right, white boy.  You and your goddam memo. You needed to prove your point, uh?
He's special.
The lights come up, you pull the switch.
We're no leaving you!
Just inner chambers...
Manny...
Who know?  We get lucky, maybe a couple of 'em'll be ours.
You know where they get this fertility stuff?  They extract it from the urine of menopausal Italian nuns.
Don't touch it.  And for Godsakes, try not to sweat.  They can sense chemical changes...
I'm gonna pull it out and I want you to pin it down, okay?
My God.
Well...  ...maybe it takes time to get the hang of it.
Shhh... we're just outside Silver Creek.
Here.
What are they...?
Shouldn't I be in a hospital?
You're very kind...
It shouldn't be too much longer.  Once the roads are open, the lines'll be up in no time. If you give me their numbers, I'll keep trying them for you.  Could I ask you a favor?  I noticed in your case there was a new Paul Sheldon book and...  and I wondered if maybe... 
You want to read it?
They had it at the store, Paul, there was a whole batch of them there. As soon as I saw it, I slammed my money down. I got the first copy.
...it's like a visit from my oldest, dearest friend.
I guess that means it's okay.
Done?
I DIDN'T...
You're such a kidder. I have a big surprise for you. But first there's something you must do.
I do believe the winters are getting shorter and shorter every year. People say it has something to do with the ozone layer. What do you think?
Yes. It will be a book in my honor. For saving your life and nursing you back to health. I'll be the first one to read it.  Oh, Paul, you're going to make me the envy of the whole world...
I expect nothing less than your masterpiece.
Don't worry about that. You'll have total solitude so you can concentrate on your work.
Are you sure? 'Cause if you want, I'll bring back the whole store for you.
Yeah, well I wouldn't expect too much.
What? What happened to "I'll treasure whatever you do?"
--cliff-hangers--
"HE DIDN'T GET OUT OF THE COCKADOODIE CAR!"
...have to wait.
My secret is I only use fresh tomatoes, never canned. And to give it that little extra zip, I mix in some Spam with the ground beef.
Did you study decorating, or do you just have a flair?
No, I haven't.
This is so exciting. It's Windthorne, her first love, right?
Work, work, work.  Virginia? When was that blizzard?
Could be the weight of the snow.
That thing.  Here it is. Right where it's supposed to be.
I'm not sure. Maybe nothing.
He's your client, huh?
People sure like those Misery books.
So do I...
Did they win?
Paul, since you brought her up, I have to ask you this, or I'd be drummed out of the agents' union-- what about a non-fiction book? The truth about what went on in that house.
You're not scrutinizing any casual shrug for some hair-splitting nuance, are you?
Not much luggage.
You're not interested in seeing how it looks.
What made you pick <i>that</i> nag?  She'd never won a bloody thing.
Then don't say it.
Sort it all out.
And you're going to have time.  There's been a change of plans.
A change of plans?
Nyah!
Fight a bit of a cold..
You know, that was the hardest part of having to portray you.  Grinning like an idiot every fifteen minutes.
Well do you disagree with that?
Not at all.  But how about going into town and confirming your intuitions on site?
Wrong.  All we've got to worry about is Ambrose.  Nyah will take care of Nyah.
It is, Billy.
Before we kill her or cure her..
Uh-huh.
Indeed.
What's you name?
Awfully short notice..
You're not a liar.  Or you're an awfully good one..  ..this thing these blokes pinched..
Five, six-hundred thousand.
That's lot of people out there..how many of them, I wonder, are capable of something like that?
I'd like a little more conviction..
But I don't have a conscience.  I'm a bloody thief.
Yes?
Ethan, you know what frightens me most when I'm with him?..the thought of never seeing you..how are we getting out of here?
Well.  You're sorry and I'm sorry.
If he didn't want to go anywhere without me, how did you get him on the flight?
- right.  In fact since the plane went down our banking sources have confirmed a marked increase in the stock pilling of cash in terrorists accounts.
If that's what you're thinking Ambrose would have set up a bidding situation with any number of buyers before he got on the plane.  Locating him in time to stop something like that -
Excuse me?
We could lock down passport control and all ports of authority, but that won't stop Ambrose, and beyond him, we don't know who else we're looking for -- all terrorist bank accounts of which we're aware are stable.  No deposits, no withdrawals.  Therefore no suspects.
We think we've got our finger on the buyer.
But that leaves another seven or eight pints of Chimera.
She sacrificed herself..
Why not?  You've done just about everything else on this operation.
Well, Bellerophon, it turns out, was only really effective against Chimera.
In this case, it wasn't a bad idea.  In face, it was a pretty damn good idea. Just don't make a habit of it.  And, as for Ms. Hall, in light of her efforts, her criminal records will certainly be expunged.  I'm assuming you approve.
Where is she now, by the way?  Do you know?
I'm with an old friend now, Dmitri.
He was quite a man.  Did he know before the end you two had succeeded?
..it seems we have a problem, Dmitri.
Nekhorvich's boss?
Left jacket pocket?
Confirm.  Left jacket pocket.
I don't know, but Nekhorvich was not a manic.  Get me a twenty on Nyah.
Now how to get in there.
Thirty-second opening in the roof and a 250-foot drop.
Kasimov, Kasimov, good that you called us.
The man's gone black, Barnes.  He's under until he decides to surface.
Look we can use someone from the Embassy and we can get the local authorities involved. Close off his transportation.
All ten million.
Is he serious?
I don't think you're in any position to give orders, do you?  Not while I'm holding this.
Did we get it?
Shut up!  I saw you.  You were in the car.
Did they send you...Did they send you?
I'm going to get it for him.  Whoever the mole is, I think goes by the name of Job, at least part of the time. 1 can't find him, but if he knows 1 have the NOC list, he'll find me.
May I come in?
You don't think we're going to make it.
We did what we had to do.
Claire...Hey...
I dont think so.
Heard a lot about you, Hunt.  Dont disappoint me.
I can't tell you how sorry I am.  I know how much Jim in particular meant to you, Ethan.  Personally as well as professionally.
What?
That's right.  Max, it seems, has two unique gifts -- a capacity for anonymity and for corrupting susceptible agents. This time he's gotten to someone on the inside - he's put himself in a position to buy our NOC list. An operation he referred to as "Job 314".  The job he thought Golitsyn was doing tonight.
This whole operation was a molehunt.
Information.
I'm not letting this list get out in the open.
Reach your folks?  How they feeling?
It's all one big negotiation, isn't it?
He was a good guy for a long, long time. Just - not long enough.  Gotta catch my flight.. So.  How's it feel being a solid citizen again?
Why not?  You gave Job a hundred and twenty five thousand.
Because I can deliver the actual NOC list.  The one you have is not only worthless, it's certain to be equipped with a homing device to pinpoint your exact location.
I don't have to tell you what a comfort anonymity can be in my profession -- like a warm blanket.  My deal with Job was subject to a successful boot scan.  Obviously it didn't pass muster.  Deal's off.
<u>Ten</u> million.  Ten million in negotiable U.S. Treasury certificates, in bearer form, coupons attached.  And one more thing -- your personal assurance that Job will be at the exchange.
Ha, dear boy!  I do hope this doesnt prelude a meeting in private.
The possibility alone is worth ten million.  Baggage car, rack 3.  Silver briefcase.  Combination 314.
We'll see.
Merci.
You're not going to any meeting without me.
Higher.  Higher.
I don't communicate very well through a shroud.
If Max doesn't like what you have to say, you'll be wearing that shroud indefinitely.
Oh?  What's the problem?
I don't know, I had to go to Chicago again.  You were in Kiev.  You tell me.
Not this week. This week he's flyfishing at the Oughterard Slough in County Kildare, with one of our best Irish guides.
About two hundred yards from the bridge.
Yeah, smaller countries don't computerize customs records -
Jim, who do you think you're kidding?  A doctor's gotta look at that.  You can't sit up straight.
Jesus, Ethan.  Good for you.
Youre probably right.
I usually am.
Once we leave the safehouse, get in there and crash.  Ill call you from Paris.
And get a doctor.
I don't know.
Such a nice ass.
Try it again.
Its working.
Oh, you're not going. You're staying.
I don't like him.
Thank you, Rose.
Cosmo, this is Ronny, Johnny's brother.
Okay.
Again?
You did this once it didn't work out.
The guy died.
What killed him?
I won't come.
I didn't give you away the first time.
Maybe.
What are you doing here?
Yes.
That's it.
Loretta. What's that smell?
Fast.
I've got you.
I've never seen a moon like that.
Take it easy.
You're invited to the wedding! It's in a few weeks. Why didn't you do like him and be with your dying mother in Palermo?
Marc Chagall. A Russian.
What's the matter?
Yeah.
Why not?
No.
No.
No, I'll tell him.
How about a month from today?
Must it be so definite? Can't we just say that we will be married when I get back?
Who is he?
Did he tell her?
Where you been?
No. But I have a hangover.
Hi.
Listen, I gotta go. I'll take the deposit to the bank but I'll do the books tomorrow. I gotta go.
I know.
Alright. This is your penance. Say two rosaries and... be careful, Loretta. Reflect on your life.
I don't know.
Well. There's the Bible story. God took a rib from Adam and made Eve. Maybe men chase women to get the rib back. When God took the rib, he left a hole there, place where there used to be something. and the women have that. Maybe a man isn't complete as a man without a woman.
Well. Yeah. You may not want to.
Don't mind about me. But could you do me a favor and clear her place and take away all evidence of her, and bring me a big glass of vodka?
Don't shit where you eat.
Then why are you eating alone?
I guess you can't invite me in?
We could go to my apartment. You could see how the other half lives.
Rita. Rita.
A witch,  a witch,  burn her!
Burn them.
No, no,  It floats.   Throw her in the pond Tie weights on her.  To the pond.
Halt!  Who goes there?
So?  We have ridden since the snows of winter covered this land, through the kingdom of Mercea.
Please!
Well, I didn't vote for you.
You don't vote for kings.
Well, how did you become king, then?
Of course.
What is that?
I command you, as King of the Britons to stand aside.
'Tis but a scratch.
A scratch?  Your arm's off.
Course I have.
I am King Arthur and these are the Knights of the Round Table.  Whose castle is this?
Oh yes.  It's very nice + +  CUT TO BATTLEMENTS. THE TAUNTER  turns to some others. + +                              MAN +      I told him we already got one. + +  They all giggle. +
What is your name?
And that, my lord, is how we know the Earth to be banana-shaped.
Well now, Launcelot, Galahad, and I wait until nightfall and then leap out of the rabbit and take the French by surprise, not only by surprise but totally unarmed!
No.  Ni!  More like this. "Ni"!
There!  Look!
What manner of man are you that can conjure up fire without flint or tinder?
You know my name?
A G...g...g...
Behind the rabbit?
... You silly sod.
Je...sus Christ!
I'm thirty-seven.
I've said I'm sorry about the old woman, but from the behind you looked ...
Well ... I AM king.
... must be approved at a bi-weekly meeting by a simple majority in the case of purely internal affairs.
Right.  Arthur, King of the Britons, you're Knights of the Round Table shall have a task to make them an example in these dark times ...
Well?
My name is Sir Robin of Camelot!
I dunno, Must be a king.
I will send help, brave friend, as soon as I have accomplished this most daring, desperate adventure in this genre.
Er, Well ... the thing is ... I thought your son was a lady.
Oh dear, I didn't really mean to...
Gosh - Is he all right?
Do you want to come and have a drink?
Listen, lad, I built this kingdom up from nothing.  All I had when I started was swamp ...  other kings said I was daft to build a castle on a swamp, but I built it all the same ... just to show 'em. It sank into the swamp.  So I built a another one ... that sank into the swamp.  I built another one ...  That fell over and THEN sank into the swamp ....  So I built another ... and that stayed up. ... And that's what your gonna get, lad: the most powerful kingdom in this island.
But, Father.
Yes?
No ....  keep him in here ... and make sure he doesn't ...
Until you, or anyone else ...
What?
Make sure he doesn't leave.
The Prince ... ?
Well ...
Oh, let me go and have a bit of peril?
Oh, fair one, behold your humble servant, Sir Launcelot, from the Court of Camelot.  I have come to take you ...  away ... I'm terribly sorry ...
I didn't.
How about yourself?
Sixty.
It's better than shovelling horse shit.
Come on, man.  There's love and there's ...
Which one of us is she flirting with?
Aye, but will they?
She's got an army of people to get her up and out.
She'll blow hot and cold on you, John, she always does.  You want to be careful.
They said you were drunk.  Why don't you tell her the truth?
What's this?
The place is a mess.
Won't you give yourself a rest, John? She's other people to look out for her.
Good man.  And is she all right?
Your Royal Highness.  What a pleasure to see you here.
Of course.
Tell her the Prince of Wales wishes to speak with her urgently about matters concerning the press.
And that is my last word on the matter.
Mr. Carter, the Head Butler, sits there.
By whose authority?
Her Majesty's routine at Osborne House is not as you will remember it.  The Household remains in full mourning and no-one is permitted to raise their voice under any circumstances whatsoever.  As for the Queen's routine, she breakfasts at nine thirty, lunches at two,takes tea at five thirty and dinner at eight forty five.  No one is allowed to leave the building while the Queen is at home. On the rare occasions when she is out, you may ask permission to leave, but only with my consent. You're to be ready to walk the pony at any time after ten o'clock.  You'll clean her outdoor things and do any odd jobs as and when she requires.
Her Highness' Equerry.
I came down at the Queen's request. I'll take my orders from her.
You sent for me.
It's nothing.
So...?
She'll think I betrayed her.
My husband was always very complimentary in speaking of you.  He would have approved, I am sure, of my calling on you in this way.  I trust it does not inconvenience you too much.
Yes.  That will be company for you.
You have been told repeatedly not to stand in the courtyard unless requested to do so.
If Prince Albert were here today, he'd tell him a thing or two.
I am told so.
He has been attending at Balmoral for many years.
Yes?
Mr Brown is unable to attend today.
Why?
Please tell the Princess, and other signatories to this letter, that the Queen will not be dictated to, or made to alter, in any way, what she has found to answer for her comfort.  Do I make myself clear?
That's a very pretty shawl you are wearing, Alex.  Silk suits you well.  But you are not eating enough.  One must not let vanity overrule one's appetite.
Where is my son?
The donor.  Maybe he's alive inside the game.
How'd you know it was us?
Listen to me!  Greg never came home. I think the game has something to do with it.
No, in person.  Now.
What do you mean by "weird"?
I'm in the middle of it...
Happy?
What?
Maybe it is alive in a way...some sort of electronic intelligence.  It's like a computer virus that developed a personality or something.  It's self-replicating...it mimics life.
...but then it hits the relay stations...
What?
And beat it at it's own game.
You realize that in order to do that, we'd actually have to play the game.
Virgin sacrifices?
What?
Okay.  Give us a kiss?
Shit...
I know.
And then keep on driving?
I'm thinking!
We're glad you people could make it, and we're anxious to have you try out our new product.  We think it's going to be a big seller.  But you're the people that make it happen.  You're the market share everyone's tearing each other apart to get at.  It's your opinion that's going to make or break us.
So start at the beginning...
Give her a chance, will you?
No.
I'm going home.
I know.  Where are you Adam?
And?
Yeah.
No, this one doesn't count. It's part of the original one. So then ... until we meet again.
How...  how'd they know I was here?
Unbelievable. Look... here.  I don't know what's going on. That's so much baloney. I've got enough cash for one night, okay?
Fine. I'll check out in the morning.
Damn lot of corn raised in Hollywood these days too.
I told ya.
No, no, I'm fine.
She has pretty red hair... she is very kind I think.
What is it Rita?
Nothing. I do remember the car crash... I told you... I remember the glass ... I think about that sometimes ... I remember walking here, sort of. Now I remember this place and you. That's about it.
Mulholland Drive?
"I can call them... I can call my dad... "
"Before I kill you."
I'm all right.
Is everything all right? Is it bad for you that I'm here?
Those men in front, in the car.
It sounds kind of nice ... being somebody brand new.
Go ahead.
You feel it?
Two men... two guns in the Caddy.
So many tubes to get in, only one is the way out.
You must come in first place to move on !
Is that it ?
I'll do the standard research and have them in by midnight, pending any unforseen problems.
Come on, it works.
So what do we do ?
I'M NOT BOFFING MATTHEW !
Then you didn't give him any passwords of any kind ?
I... I .....
I wanted to let his family know....
Know what ? That it was your fault ?
Do you know where you're going ?
What was that ?
Okay, NOW I'm worried. What exactly is on the other side of the door ?
I thought you made this place ?
I didn't think he'd make it past Scraps.
Don't.
Don't eat at the console.
I've been working with you for four years, don't you think that's worthy of at least one turn at the controls ?
He probably has a history of this shit.
A real criminal.... I still think that's our in... What about her ?
And how much do we pay you annually ?
Yes sir.
That was rather.... disappointing.
What about that time when the mail room kid was accused of stealing and we put him in the "Park" ? Wasn't that a computer glitch ?
Sir ?
What then sir ? What would we do with the park with out Bruce ?
There was a bit of confusion on one of my last jobs.
What are you looking for ? A blow job ?
What was that ?
I've got five bucks that says someone dies here and now.
What happened ?
The power went out in half the park.
As appealing as that sounds...
Hi. I brought some wine.
Thank you, won't you come in ?
Like what, a Porsche ? A Ferrari ?
Actually, I'm more interested in the man behind the wheel more than the manufacturer. So what is it that you have that makes you a materialistic fool ?
Are you okay ?
It's that asshole Zach isn't it ?
Ow. Son of a .....  Did I ever tell you my theory on Star Wars as Porn ?
I'm not supposed to talk to strangers, not even nuns.
Hey relax, you think I kidnapped him or something?
THANK YOU.
What kind of sleazoid geek would turn her in?
What about giving the other guy a break.
I'm sorry okay...we gotta find this guy because...he knew Vada's mom and he could tell her stuff that no one else knows.
Seriously.
You were just having a fight about me. Wouldn't you like to hear my opinion?
Hi Dad.
Totally.
No.
I'm sorry I couldn't come pick you up honey.
Oh honey, back then...people did crazy things.
I was hoping I'd get to meet you.
Umm...can you come in for a minute?
She's beautiful.
Well...
oh.
So she had you in jail, in Russia?
Hi.
Then I have come to the right place.
I'm Sam Helburn. Sam.
If it's in here at all, it's in the back two rows.
My mother.
Thanks, but I think I'm gonna stick to my mom, she led a fascinating life too.
Give it back Nicholas!
There's water in your bathroom.
You're over reacting!
Yeah, RIGHT.
You know eavesdropping is a very unattractive habit.
It's not funny! I mean what am I gonna do? Without that yearbook I'm lost. I can't just walk around town looking for someone with a Wilson High School Letter sweater!!!
What difference does it make?
Well, I hope he's not watching me all the time.
Don't force it, you'll break it.
Marriage can really complicate things. So, aren't you gonna say anything about my earrings?
It's not his fault!
Nick?
Write me a poem?
Wow!
You're a good man Nicholas.
Ahh, that's right, like one big happy family. This is Nick's room and uhh....
But...are you engaged or something?
That's ridiculous, I'm...I'm very, umm, what do you call it?
I had to be, I only have five days. So just point me in the right direction and....
I should do this myself.
Who knew that when I started working in the finest foreign car shop in LA, I would also find the light of my life.
No, there's no problem, Dr. Helburn just needs to have his oil changed.
Ahh, Dr. Helburn, why don't you come in tomorrow-morning at eight o'clock, that's when we open, we'll get you started.
You couldn't?
Let's just say I...eh...I'm involved.
Where I come from, involvement...generally calls for a substantial piece of jewelry.
Ahh, why don't I come in first thing in the morning and you can check out that left blinker for me.
Oh, sure okay.
No, the milk comes when the baby comes.
Wanna play?
Danny?
WHAT?
Oh.. Oh.. Oh no?? Oh?
That can't be, I have all the classic symptoms.
Can't you see it?
I think it's still available.
Uhh, Miss devoto, these people are already at ease. This is not a Beauty Parlor, it's a Funeral Parlor.
They're dead?
Pardon?
I need the job.
Okay Mr. Sultenfuss, you got a deal.
Oh, I'm just typing up a funeral notice, you know when someone dies people want it in the paper usually, it's a service we provide for the family.
Look, it's not always luck, I mean, depending upon the placement of the numbers, a guy with 10 cards could win just as easily as a guy with 100.
Did she ever see Vada?
Stop hiding Harry, you run Harry. When I first came here, the idea of working with dead people, didn't exactly thrill me, but when I saw a family lived here, I thought, &quot;if I'm living without a family, at least I can work with one, and maybe once in a while i'll be invited in for supper.&quot;
Goodnight Vada.
Well Shelly's coming over, we're gonna go together.
HEY, OUCH, damn it!! Vada, watch what you're doing.
Dad, didn't you say you needed prunes REAL bad?
No sweetheart, you can't.
He was allergic to bees.
What was my mama like?
Uh huh. You know what your mother did when she found out she was gonna have you? She came home and painted this whole room pink. She was so sure she was gonna have a little girl.
Did you not tell Vada I'm a womanizer huh?
That's what I do. Do you wanna do it??
Hi, is Vada home?
It's okay. Mr. Bixler, I finished all the books for summer reading.
No. Well, guess i'll go home and finish off War &amp; Peace.
Uh huh, I wanna be a writer.
Uhhh, va, uhh, Vada.
Oh, Vada...
Do you think she is?
He likes her.
Really?
Who's winning?
You know Vada, you shouldn't let those girls upset you.
My ball, I lost my ball.
Ohh, right. Would you like a soda?
The boys at school don't think I am.
Do you like putting makeup on people?
No, I'm going home.
It's not a real school, it's a writing class, I wanna be a writer.
Big deal, I can do that too.  Thomas J, you got something!
Yeah he got away. Come on let's go.
It's my mother.
What?
Pacifist!
Run faster they're after us!!
Bye Mrs. Sennett.
Then go home, baby.
Maybe we should, just to see what's the big deal.
Well, let's spit on it.
... trouser width, this is all classic.  Which means safe, something I'd wear.
Is it sad to be an editor, and bask only in reflected insincerity?
Needs salt.
Sometimes I do.  Like for two months.
Kindred spirits.
I have a suggestion...
I noticed.  I'm on the noon back. We have this thing with George's family in the Hamptons.
Beyond reason.  The feminist warrior will rise up in this kid, and she'll be standing over his sleeping form with a butcher knife, selecting from a short list of body parts!
Two words.
I'm moving this book to Viking.
My heart's in my throat, here. Right off, I have to ask this monstrous favor...
Can you watch the road?
Which was the disqualifying factor?
That's why Michael and I were the wrong fit.  Right from the start.
It's been awhile.  I'll take your word.
Do you get hysterical in small confined spa...
I'm not joking.  I had to face up to all my competitive drives, and believe me, I've got 'em.
About Michael's job.
I just think you're wrong, is all.
But he always says...
If you're waiting for "Do you take this man?", that's considered poor form.
In one minute.  You are going to feel so foolish.
Michael, it's Wednesday night, you can't possibly be getting married on Su...
Well, maybe we should talk ab...
Such as.
Hate that.
Should I whistle down a cab?
Big weddings are so strange.
Except for the hot affairs we'll have twice a year.
Where did we first hear th...
It's no big deal, she just gave you the wrong keys that's s...
She denied it.  Said I was crazy and paranoid.
No, it's for the best, it really is.  We were so wrong for each other.
But the Scotch salmon was so fucking good, you decided to stay for brunch!
Does that make it right...
Oh, yeah.
... your one chance for true happiness?
Jules, what's wrong...
You're not saying you actually... you're saying that y...
It's two weeks.
I'm just thinking of how she's hurting.  Lost.  Alone.  Like her life is over.
And yet here you are.  All celibate and reclusive.
We have a Bible study meeting tonight if you'd like to come.
Don't feel that way, honey.
Yes.
How is that?
Everybody likes to be as good as their word.
No, you don't, so don't say you do. Bunch of damn liars. What do you get out or this?
Who the hell is he?
You want anything?  A drink?
D.C.
Bastard
President?
Listen, we're suppose to sing on TV day after tomorrow. At the park...
Did you see who that was?
You know anything about the stations here?
What did you say?
I said, maybe I'll change my name again.
Maybe you can look after me a little.
Well I've been following him around Just listening to him --He says he can really win -- I bet he can too - -
She had on high heels?
We don't mess with accessories.
Next you'll be sick.
Green?  Not Owen Green. Owen Green embezzled money from your grandfather
Listen. Maybe I should go...
I'm not sure. Where?
I'd really like to see you.
What?
Who is this, right?  I called you last night.
Premeditated murder.
They said go see the chaplain.
Hundreds of times.
Hello. John Triplette.
Oh, no.
Where are you going?
Dent it a little. Boy -- just she couldn1t even find it. She had a hamburger on her desk that looked three weeks old.
Hi.
What do you think of him?
You go to school together?
He ain't really new.
Got me an audition tonight.
You serious?
Now this is to raise funds for someone who can help people who are less fortunate than yourself. The more you take off, you see, more money we can raise.
How do you intend to disappear? you're probably the most famous couple in America.
I take it by your answer it was a whole new team?
They've been separated since their incarceration in a couple of penitentiaries---
The public loves you Jack...You don't mind if I call you Jack, do you?
By all means.
Who's the song bird?
Did you ever see 'Eldorado?'
She's in the holding cell, on this floor.
You guys stay on your bellies.
Manson beat you.
She doesn't talk?
She sings? What does she sing?
All right, Mickey.
Of course, I miss Mallory. She's my wife. I haven't seen her in a long time. What a stupid question.
No, Mickey, I can't let you get away with that shit. Answer the question. Was it worth it? You haven't seen, heard, or smelled Mallory in a year. Was it worth it?
You'll never understand. Me and you, Wayne, we're not even the same species. I used to be you...then I evolved. From where you're standing, you're a man. From where I'm standing, you're a ape. I'm here...I'm right here... and you...you're somewhere else, man. You say why? I say why not?
Okay...okay...I'll buy that. We'll move on and come back later.
Donut, get your camera. See if it's broke.
This is crazy. You can't escape like this.
On average forty million.
We ain't got all fuckin' day!
Just wait one fucking minute.
They can't because neither knows if the other is a deranged senseless killer like the Knoxs. So, you may as well make the first move.
Hypnotizing.
Mickey and Mallory have that edge.
Only on a much grander scale.
That's the Mickey and Mallory way.
How immediate is immediately?
Now we got to film a new intro for the follow up episode. But we put the intro for the first episode at the beginning temporarily so you can see it with some scope.
I'm as serious about that as I am about going back to the donut store, and dipping that stupid Mexican's head into the batter for forgetting my chocolate cream filled. Gimme that other box.
Wayne---
Yeah, we met. They're good men.
Yeah, sure.
Camera jam! I'm sorry Wayne. God.
Oh yes, indeed. Top flight.
Since he and his wife have been in custody, they've killed---
What are we talking about?
Chill out, Phill. Four deputies and you, I can live with that. We're about ready to go here, so let's get rid of these other assholes.
They done that too long in my family.
No thanks.
That'll be thirty-eight cents.
Want to talk to you.
You a union man?
What did you say your name is?
I been sendin' her money.
Where was your father born?
Why don't you come over for a beer when you get through?
So what you doin' with a cat like me in a joint like this?
No thanks.
Well, they seem just like everyone else.
Well, my mother was the only good teacher the colored school ever had. Nobody bothers with those kids.
Surprised?
I can see why.
Well, what d'you think?
What about them?
Am I as good as they?
How come you keep askin'?
Hi.
I could work even after the baby comes. A few hours a week, anyway.
No point fixin' it!
You heard me!
You were plenty scared that night in the car.
Duff, I love you.
Like what?
Well, it's better than windin' up like a bum.
Yeah. That's right, Jocko.  Those white guys sure shoot up at you like a yeast cake if you just cock an eye at them.
Who're you?
I'm Duff.
Most folks around here got no use for nigrahs. Got to understand them, that's all. How you doin', boy?
Well, what're you going to do?
Well, it looks like we'll be getting our new school.
Yes, the Lord's been pretty good to us. I guess you're a church man, aren't you?
Why? Don't you believe in the Lord?
And since we're talking, my wife and I don't want you hanging around our daughter.
I know just how you feel, son. But believe me, you're going about it the wrong way.
You can be cocky now, boy. But you won't make it. You won't last. I just feel sorry for Josie. I knew it wouldn't work out.
Well, if it ain't Duff!
So you're courtin' the preacher's girl. Well, just watch your step, boy, or he'll preach you right into hell.  I'm counting on you, Reverend.
No. Why?
Your mother used to lay for her boss, boy. Did you know that?
You hate Raoul?
Your Raoul?
You didn't come here to destroy Wintermute. You can to save a man you love. A man who isn't even capable of returning that love. Such a waste...
Easy...
What's an A.I.
The Villa Straylight. Home of the Royal Family and the mainframe of the computer entity we know as Wintermute. If we can get Molly in, she can access the mainframe to cripple Mute's defences, the Case can destroy it in Cyberspace.
My days of punching deck are over. For you or anybody else.
Anything rated higher than a P.C.'s got a hard-wired suicide switch. It'll self- destruct.
I've arranged for him to work with us.
And then?
I cannot tell a lie. Sorry.
Yeah, well it's working.
That's Lord Frederick Tessier. Owns most of Freeside. Wintermute's mainframe is centred in the Royal Family's villa.
An odd selection, Mr Case.
Are you even really alive?
You're pleasant tonight.
Hey, bro.
Yeah. That was me.
Maelcom... Do you think there's a hell for computers?
Trajectory coordinates and a fuel ratio...  If we re-enter over Mexico, we just might make it.
Jah guides us.
What you're telling me is that I'm dead. Right?
I can't feel nothing because I am nothing.  Just playback. A ghost in the machine.
Who got you into this?
What?
I have to figure out how to penetrate this thing, Dix... Crack its ice. We gotta get close enough to log the pattern.
We got problems topside.
Take a look. Son of a bitch won't feel a thing until it's too late.
This thing's loaded with internal virus systems. You'll fry like an egg in there.
Case.
Hello, Case.
You set me up from the beginning. It was you that got Julius killed.
He's a resourceful guy, your boss. How long you work for him?
For someone else. Bodyguard. Courier... Whatever.
Holy shit...
How long have I been out?
I gotta know... did it work>
I'm going in.
I'll show you how to tell what's going on. If things go south, you unplug me.
A regular Fagan.
The first fun's bound to be rough. It that read out fluctuates more than ten points... just pull this out. But if the EEG flatlines, don't touch anything.
Won't that mean you're dead?
Technically, yeah, but people have made it back after as long as three minutes.
Case... it's four a.m.
Yeah... Yeah, I'm fine.
Then you and Maelcom get out of here before the place is crawling with guardsmen.
Everybody's favourite computer, of course. He may have out calculated the rest of you, but I have certain qualities that don't translate well on microchips.
I'm Josie. Aldys is an interesting name.
Sometimes I wonder what they talk about.
Hey, where's your sweatshirt?
The right guy is out there. I'm just not going to kiss a whole bunch of losers to get to him.
Okay. That's bad.
Now this is cute.
Josie, you have totally transitioned.
: Wait. Do you know any gay guys?
Hey Josie- who did Archie date Betty or Veronica?
They don't have to be in the office Christmas show?
Yes, urm, she's right. I have learned it is a very popular place for the young people to go.
Do you even know these kids?
What if I say no?
There is no lid! Nothing's going on between Sam and me. Coulson. Mr. Sam Coulson and me.
Maybe we should go in a different room?
I'm sure you've probably heard that I want to ask you, but I'd like to know if you'd go to prom with me. I know we Didn't hit it off right at the beginning but-
Rufus.  But I don't even know where you live.
You having fun?
Oh.
Better person than I.
No, I mean, no big whoop.
Come on! It's not that hard. All you need is one person. Once the right person thinks you're cool, you're in. Everyone else will be too scared to question it.
Better than I...
Are you crazy?! You can't do this.
You're twenty-three years old!
And a gymnast!
Yes. Exactly. Major Rufus.
Hi, everyone.  I don t think we've met. I'm Sam Coulson- although for some reason the school has this thing about not letting you guys call me Sam.
Maybe distant cousins. They did have that egg shape in common.
Our penguin, right?
told him  --if I'm wrong about this girl, you can take away my teaching certificate!
Proms always make me sad. They're so final. Graduation. Everyone's scattering, moving on.
So--have you thought anymore about Dartmouth?
Kirsten, that bran muffin has like 75 fat grams.
Into our group.
Good. Gibby gave me champagne.
Wow - I-
We followed your instructions.
The deadly nightshade you slipped me wore off, Sally... I thought I'd find you here....
You're mine, you know.  I made you.
I'm grown up now.  I have to leave some time.
I know.
That's not true.  It's a beautiful home, wonderfully comfortable... I'm indebted to you for everything... It's just...
<i>                      Just a box with bright colored paper And the whole thing topped with a bow.</i>
<i>                      -- It's a bat. --              Will it bend? -- It's a rat. --              Will it break? -- Perhaps it's the head that I found in the lake.</i>
Just out for a while.
I told you I want that room unpacked.
He needs professional help.  I think we should take him to a psychiatrist.
I'll kill you now.
He can't hold you Jesse.  He's losing his grip - you can get out.
How much longer you figure he'll keep us out here?
You hit that ball pretty good, Walsh.
Yeah, well, Schneider's got a stick up his ass today.
Oh Jesus.  I'm gonna be sick.
your timing was perfect - I was getting the third degree in there.
Hi!  You didn't have to wait.
Yeah, yeah, sure.
What is this place?
C'mon, cut it out.
I feel like a jerk.
Yeah?
Maybe it only happens when you're sleeping - that's the way it was with Nancy, wasn't it?
Whoa!
What is it?
Why won't you talk to me?
You're not being fair to me.  I'm worried about you and I want to help you get through this thing.
Fred Krueger.  He's been trying to get hold of me, to use me.  He needs me to get out of his world into ours...He's gonna take me again.
Oh...uh, no, just some milk, Mom.
Morning.
How'd you sleep, honey, okay?
Look, Miss Thompson, I don't know what you want from me.
Just some answers.  There are other kids involved, its not just Kristen.  All good kids, smark kids.
Now if you'll excuse me, I have to get to the club.
Hi Mom.
It's okay, I'm not tired.  Really.
What's happening?
Do you still...see each other?
Are you okay?
The dispensary.  I'm talking clean pharmaceutical high.  A night at Club meth.
What are these, beauty marks?
Nothing like a little cheery news to start the day.
Most authentic Mexican food in Springwood, which isn't saying much.  your parents still live around here?
That's what I know.
All right.  Then let's eliminate the symptom for the time being.
With Hypnocyl?
I used to be like them, Neil.  I know what they're going through.
I can't believe I just did that.
I'm running out of answers. A patient sleepwalks out of a security ward up to a tower with no access.  A girl, alone in a room, dies by jumping six feet straight up into a television set. Nothing makes sense anymore.
I'm Taryn White.  I only came here because it was a better deal than juvie hall.  Also, I guess 'cause I'm going through some very stange shit.
And you won't make any progress until you can recognize your dreams for what they are.
You can't!  They'll be defenseless against their dreams.
What was that?
A sad choice.
Cooling down.
I won't allow it.
For God's sake, Elizabeth...just try to help the kids, will you?  Listen to them.
And may I say that's a gorgeous tie.
Splendid.  I'm actually in the stock- market, so not really similar fields, though I have done some amateur stuff -- P.G. Wodehouse, you know -- farce, all that.  'Ooh -- careful there, vicar.'  Always imagined it's a pretty tough job, though, acting. I mean the wages are a scandal, aren't they?
I see friends from university -- clever chaps -- been in the business longer than you -- they're scraping by on seven, eight thousand a year. It's no life.  What sort of acting do you do?
Films mainly.
No, thanks.  I'll just look around.
Thank you.
Yeh -- unfortunately, things are going to be pretty busy, but... okay, let's give it a try.  Four o'clock could be good.
Hello.
Okay.
You'll have to prove it.  This is a great brownie and I'm going to fight for it.  State your claim.
So who left who?
I'm sorry.
No, you were brilliant
I'm rash and I'm stupid and what am I doing with you?
I don't know.  It got to the point where I couldn't remember any of the reasons I loved him.  And you... and love?
'Message from command.  Would you like them to send in the HKs?'
What do you think?
I do.  It feels like how being in love should be.  Floating through a dark blue sky.
With a goat playing a violin.
You have a stunt bottom?
Would you be tempted to go for a slightly better bottom than your own?
The ice cream or Mel Gibson's bottom?
You and every person in this country.
Oh God yes -- I'm sorry.
Stay forever.
This is such a mess.  I come to you to protect myself against more crappy gossip and now I'm landed in it all over again.  For God's sake, I've got a boyfriend.
Now stop.  Stop.  I beg you -- calm down. Have a cup of tea.
Excuse me?
But... wait... there are things to say.
... Yes, that's fine.  Of course.  I... you know... of course... I'll just... be getting along then... nice to see you.
Really -- don't do that -- I'm sure this is not his job.
I haven't decided.
Nice one.  Would you like my phone number?
Yes... I've always wondered what Patrick Swayze is like in real life.
Quickly, quickly -- talk very quickly what are you doing here with Anna Scott?
Anna Scott?
Di Caprio.
Me?
How you doing?  I thought you guys all wore those penguin coats.
Oh great.  Could you do me a favour and try to get us some really cold water up here?
I'll see what I can do.
Absolutely.  Ice cold still water.
Are you a fan of Henry James?
Cappuccino as ordered.
So it could have been neither of them?
Martin -- your customer.
But it's not for the shop.  It's for you.
Max.  This is Anna.
So I get the brownie?
Every time.  But don't despair -- I think I have the solution to your problems.
Well?
That's not fair.
No, sir.
There's something wrong with this yogurt.
Yeh, I wrote a couple down.
Which was?
Try 'Flintstone.'
What?
You're welcome.  Did you find them?
Maybe.
Spike.  For God's sake -- she's in trouble -- get a grip.
I wouldn't go outside.
Was it you?
Bad news.
We've got a security camera in this bit of the shop.
So, I saw you put that book down your trousers.
Okay -- what if I did have a book down my trousers?
Yes, that's perfectly correct.
And yet you suspect her.
Yes, Mister Harding?
You mean you don't want their votes to count, Billy!
P-p-p-please du-du-du-don't t-t tell her, p-p-please...
Billy, that girl couldn't have pulled you in there forcibly...
N-n-n-n-duh-duh-duh-pl-pl-pl-pl-muh muh-muh...
Yes. Now go along, Mister McMurphy. Go along.
Mister McMurphy, this ward is a democratic community run by the patients and their votes, so you should feel at ease in your new surroundings to the extent you can freely discuss emotional problems in front of the patients and staff. However, the cardinal rule, and I must emphasize this: Everyone keeps their seat during the meeting!
Yes, Mister McMurphy.
You men remain seated!
Yeah, ya should've come along with us, Miss Ratched, an' gotten a little sun on your cheeks and maybe caught a fish or two.
Miss Ratched, would you please save a space for my aunt? She's comin' down from Portland.
Certainly, Mister McMurphy, with pleasure.
Gotta go now, ma'am...
Yes. Good luck, Mister McMurphy.
That's okay, kid...
H-H-Help!
W-W-We h-heard y-you w-were n-never c-c-coming back!
Whatsamatter, kid, what's botherin' you...?
Ah-ah-ah-are y-y-y-you g-g-g-going t-t-t-to muh-muh-muh-marry her?
C-C-C-C-Candy!
Candy? Hell no, Billy, she's just a good friend, that's all...
Ya like that, Chief, huh?
Wait a minute...
There they are!
When do you think we'll be going back, Mack?
He's a big flounder. Could weigh two, three hundred. You got to lift him in with a winch.
Yeah, Harding, where do you breathe anyway?
Is that your sense of humor or are you tryin' to say somethin'?
With your own two hands?
Okay, sucker.
What for?
I'm busting outta this place.
I don't trust you!
No!
Big king, too bad...
McMurphy killed two attendants and escaped...
Gimme the ball!
My turn.
Oh, what was that?
Come on, Doc, you must be kiddin'.
What's the horse pill for, honey?
Look, miss, I don't like swallowing something without knowing what it is!
Are you a doctor?
Out. It's the way out. So just keep it in your minds if ya ever wanna make use of it.
You just come on with that three fifty and Martini will take care of himself... Your dice, Scanlon.
You comin' in to hold my hand?
He's in charge.
Hit me!
Yeah!
This way, Mister McMurphy.
Yes, sir, I sure am gonna enjoy my stay here.
Ya know, I ain't never been in an institution of psychology before.
After you, ma'am.
You've been drinking on the job again, haven't you, Mister Turkle!
I want those men put back to bed, Mister Turkle!
What?
Yes, but...  He was having an affair.
No, she wasn't my sister.
Your mother.
You don't understand.  The man I'm supposed to marry is on that plane.
You ask what room he's in, okay?
No.
--separate, in the evening..."
You're sure...
We found each other, didn't we?
What?
Let's face it.  Sooner or later we all die.
Dwayne?
Ask her if she knows how I might reach him?  If she has a telephone number?
A restaurant.  In Piazza Navona.
I'M NOT PUSHING IT.
Yeah, but, what if he doesn't live here?  Like, what if he's a cannibal in New Guinea or something?
We'll KNOW.
Larry!  What are you doing here?  Mom sent you.
But Faith--
You...
So, this is what you do?  I mean when you're not playing other parts?
Lots of history.  For example, did you know, according to legend, this coastline used to harbor Sirens?
Damon Bradley...
To the foot doctor.
He's safe.
It's in the south.  I've still got my rental car.  I can get you there by morning...
Oh no, I don't think that would be a good idea.
Oh.  That's nice.
What?...
Well, how about those old romantic movies with those great stars, huh? Like Audrey Hepburn.
Promise me you won't leave without saying goodbye.
Hi.  Are you... busy?
Thank you.  So, since I have a few more days of vacation left, I was wondering if maybe you'd want to do something sometime.  I mean, you know, if you don't have... other plans.
I can't believe you did that!
I was hoping for the real thing.
Any night.
Well, not exactly...
Hmmmm... Well, the scampi sounds good...
What about that guy you work with, Mike what's-his-name?
No.  He smokes.
It's a metaphor.  It's women who always think there's some unknown out there that's going to be better than what's in front of them.  And instead wind up with nothing.
Just that they came out of somebody's experience is all.
Is he gay?
I don't know.  I don't think so.
Larry brought me flowers last night.
It's a miracle.
Thank you so much.
You're just going to fly to Italy and start combing the streets?
Just once more, so you'll be sure to know what to look for.
What are you doing?
A Butterfinger wrapper.
Only what?
You know, no offense or anything Kate, but I think I'm starting to see Larry's side of the story.
I don't know.  I just asked her if she knew him and all of the sudden--
Because I'm the one who's single.
I never even got to be single.
Right, right...  Okay..  You don't think he's gonna think I'm too aggressive?
What?
That was really sweet...
No... Like a psychiatrist.
Packing.
A little bad luck?
Why do they read kids fairy tales in the first place?  Children are very impressionable, you know.
I know, but...
You sure you'll be okay?
What if he doesn't like me?
So...
My friend is looking for her brother and she thinks this woman knows where he is.  Can you tell us what she's saying?
Oh.
How old are you?
Huh?
This is the last one before the wedding, right?
Right.
Mania.
Thanks.
I'm gonna take her home first.
If you kept your ears wide open instead of your mouth
When he got up and chased them they thought it was a dead man coming after them.
I make it twentysix twenty-three. You're fifty short, Skins.
So they're walking along and smiling. That doesn't mean he's going to talk. There's no evidence until he gives public testimony.
You said they was only going to talk to him.
Mmhmmm.
Ten cents a hundred pounds on everything that moves in and out. And you don't have to lift a finger. It'll be three-four hundred a week just for openers.
Listen, Terry, these piers we handle through the locals you know what they're worth to us?
I know. I know.
Make up your mind, kid, I beg you, before we get to four thirty-seven River... .
It wasn't him!  It was you, Charley. You and Johnny. Like the night the two of youse come in the dressing room and says, "Kid, this ain't your night we're going for the price on Wilson." It ain't my night. I'd of taken Wilson apart that night! I was ready remember the early rounds throwing them combinations. So what happens This bum Wilson he gets the title shot outdoors in the ballpark!  and what do I get a couple of bucks and a one-way ticket to Palookaville.  It was you, Charley. You was my brother. You should of looked out for me. Instead of making me take them dives for the short-end money.
How could anyone do this to Joey. The best in the neighborhood... . everybody said it, not only me. Who'd want to harm Joey? Tell me who?  -- who?
I wish I knew, Edie, But 
Hello, Edie.
Oh, I thought you was gonna go to work with all them muscles. 
None of your business.
They play pretty rough.
I want to be a teacher.
I know. I thought I'd never get those braces off.
What for?
I go for this stuff. You know this city's full of hawks? There must be twenty thousand of 'em. They perch on top of the big hotels and swoop down on the pigeons in the park.
Listen get this straight don't look at me when you say them things. It wasn't my fault what happened to your brother. Fixing Joey wasn't my idea... .
Why, Terry, who said it was?
His racket?
I can't let myself fall in love with you.
I won't eat cheese for no cops, that's for sure.
It's true.
I don't rate it.
It's just a scratch. You won't die. She turns away from him.
Edie, I need you to love me. Tell me you love me.
I didn't say I didn't love you. I said stay away from me.
Terry, I'm frightened. More and more frightened.
Edie, for years we pushed quarters into a cookie jar, to keep you up there with the Sisters, and to keep you from things like I just seen out the window. My own daughter arm-in-arm with Terry Malloy. You know who Terry Malloy is?
I'm not trying to tell you he's Little Lord Fauntleroy.
He wanted to see me again.
Pop, don't think I'm not feeling grateful for all you've done to get me an education and shelter me from this.  But now my eyes are open. I see things I know are so wrong how can I go back and keep my mind on things that are only in books and that people aren't living? I'm staying, Pop. And I'm going to keep on trying to find out who's guilty for Joey. I'd walk home with a dozen Terry Malloys if I thought they could help me. I tell you I'm staying, Pop. Pop starts to pull his belt out of his trousers.
I don't want to hear it in there.
How much is your soul worth if you don't?
Give me that gun.
Now listen, if you know who the pistols are, if you see them on the dock every day, are you going to keep still until they cut you down one by one?  Are you? Are you? How about you, Nolan?
You're being served with a subpoena, Mr. Malloy.
I thought you were going to take him that night but...
Listen, this ain't for publication.
Well, I better get going. Hit those stairs again.  Was that a looping right or an uppercut the first time you caught him?
You'll work.
's all right, kid. I took care of 'em myself this morning.
Better.
Take it easy now, Terry.
He followed my birds into their coop. Here, you want him?
I'll bring him up to your loft.
I I musta counted wrong, boss, I
Nothing happened, he says. Some operator you got yourself there, Charley. One more like him and we'll all be wearing striped pajamas.
Oh, he did. Half an hour later a certain Timothy J. Nolan went into secret session with the Commission and he did all the talking.
You mean Kayo Nolan, the old timer? He doesn't know much.
He don't, huh?  Well, he knows thirty-nine pages worth of our operation.
You ratted on us, Terry.
That's life.  My kisses are alive.
All right.  Don't worry, I'll be right beside you.
Those creatures..!
I am--It's our only chance.
What can we do against them?
My old boyfriend Tommy would never have gotten me in a mess like this.  At least <i>he's</i> got brains.
But they are not yet one of us.
El Dia De Los Muertos...A celebration in her country.
As I said, a worshipper of snakes, and of smoke, and flames.
When!?
At your discretion...But first, I desire more entertainment.
Then see that it does not happen again, in the penalty of Everlasting Despair.  Now are there others?
Ahh, good.  Then I will see them.  Dismiss the rest.
That's funny, Adele.  How many more times you gonna gimme that one?
Listen to Miss Smarty Mouth.  Out there in the free world.
Listen, Adele, the reason I called, that party is today instead of Sunday. About eight-thirty, like only a few hours from now.  So you'll have to get hold of Buddy, whatever he might be doing...
Oh, is this Adele?
The FBI didn't tell you I was with them?
They didn't <i>tell</i> me anything, they asked questions.
He didn't want me to.
But you spoke to him on the phone.
Jack came out of a bank he just robbed in Pasadena, couldn't get his stolen car to start.  Battery was dead.  He looks over, sees Buddy sitting in a burgundy Bonneville, goes up, offers him a thousand dollars for a jump. Turns out, Buddy was casing the same bank and saw the whole thing.  Buddy says, I'll take the thousand, but we're leaving in my car, not that piece of shit you come in.  They musta robbed fifty banks together.
You did work for Emil, right?
Yeah, I was Emil's box-jumper for almost four years.
You were his what, his box?
Go away, or I'll call the police.
Say anything in there about Karen Sisco?
Her phone's probably tapped.
You at least bring the gun?
I guess Adele's in good hands.
First thing we do, we get to Detroit, we find Glenn, then we find a window to throw him out of.
Doesn't say what she's doing up here, but I don't think it has anything to do with us.
You tell your sister about it?
How long were you with the girl?
I mean, they don't know for sure he's dead.  Look, there's always a chance we'll walk out've there with nothing.  I say let fate decide.
You find out?
There's still time, take me up on my offer.
From the looks of those boys, the Ripper too.
Oh... different things, prison, movies.
Have you ever shot a man?  How many times have you been primary through the door?
Where are you?  I been trying to reach you.
You get the key?
Take the radio, stay down here in the lobby, watch the elevator.
Call and tell you.
I could walk out of here.
You excited?
Yeah, but I see you moved it up.
How are you, Raymond?
You know, I'm not in homicide any more.
Yeah, I'm crimes against persons and property now, also sex crimes and child abuse.
How much for your company at chow?
Company, shit.  I watch the man's back.
Look, Snoop, I don't know what Glenn promised you or what you think you're gonna get, but the deal is me and Buddy get half of whatever we take from Ripley, understand?  How you and Glenn cut up the rest is up to you.
Look, what you worried about Glenn for?  What's he know?
Give me a minute, talk to Buddy.
That what they're wearing these days to break and enter?
Nervous?
Buddy.  That's his given name?
I believe you would have.  Another fall, I did seven years at Lompoc.  And I don't mean the place next door where some of Nixon's people went.
You don't act like it.
They put a hundred and eighty-seven bullet holes in Clyde, Bonnie Parker and the car they were driving.  Bonnie was eating a sandwich.
Yeah, right.  Anyway, that scene where Warren Beatty and Faye Dunaway get shot?  I remember thinking at the time it wouldn't be a bad way to go, if you have to.
I'm just worried maybe I'm not old enough for you.
There's a guy here on the task force right now.  Maybe I should put him on the phone, let you two work it out.
You won't do that.
One last score, that the idea?  Move to some island.
Whatta you mean <u>we'll</u> make it an island?
Well, we got that out of the way.  Tell me, Celeste.  What do you do for a living?
I don't have a problem with it.
I had one just like it -- well, it was the same idea, but I had to get rid of it.
No.  What do you do for a living, Gary?
It's your game.  I've never played this before.
Oh, God...
Well, I'd say who I was and do you remember me and ask if you'd like to meet for a drink.
She did, huh.
What're you now, a desperado?  Put the guns down.
Studs.  Man, I haven't heard that since Lompoc.  What's going on?
Take your sunglasses off.
Whose blood you got all over you?
How many?
When?
You know who they are?
Of course not.
How, Dick?  The way <u>you</u> earned it?  By marrying some rich broad owns the company, selling it off a piece at a time, then divorcing her?  What is this Knute Rockne, pull yourself up by the bootstraps bullshit?  Back in prison, guy like you, place like that, you were ice cream for freaks.  You were a goddamn dumpling.  Maurice and a dozen other guys coulda bled you till you had nothing.  Till you <u>were</u> nothing.  I saved your ass.  So you'll pardon me if I don't wanna sit on a fuckin stool all day saying "sign in here please" or "hey, pal, you can't park there."  Okay, Dick?  I can't do it.
Maurice Miller, couple of his friends.
Yeah.  That was the ninth.
The <u>ninth</u>?
Like what?
I got a big score lined up up north. They wouldn't even know about it, it wasn't for me.  I could do it right now myself, except it's so fucking cold up there in January--
What am I supposed to do <u>now</u>?
But I thought the whole thing was your idea?
But listen, Glenn.  If you're lying to me...
It's a guy you know.
Gimme another hint.
Wait a minute.  I'm letting <i>you</i> in on this, not all your friends.
How you know that?
Flyweight.
You know your divisions.  You like the fights?  Like the rough stuff?  Yeah, I bet you do.  Like to get down and tussle a little bit?  Like me and Tuffy, before she got run over, we use to get down on the floor and tussle.  I say to her, "You a good dog, Tuffy, here's a treat for you."  And I give Tuffy what every dog love best.  You know what that is? A bone.  I can give you a bone, too, girl.
He said he stayed with Maurice.
Happy birthday, kid.  You want another Coke?
Can't.  I gotta drive out to Glades, then I'm meeting Ray Nicolet at ten.
He's still married though, huh?
We don't get to talk much any more.
What are you thinking about?
You like the wild ones, don't you? Tillman, Nicolet and now Foley.  You know, I've always said there's a thin line between the cowboy cops and the armed robbers, all those guys that love to pack.
You wave back?
So?
He doesn't seem to hold a grudge.  What <i>I</i> want to know is why, they got such a big score up north, did Foley hang around Miami for so long?  Any thoughts on that one?
Out for the evening?
Did you pay the guy the reward?
I think it's Dunn & <u>Brad</u>street.  But then, I could be wrong...
Faux goose down.
Midge.
I think he must've fell in.
Are all the Yanks as anxious as you are to get yourself killed, Lieutenant?
You're Walker, right?
Danny, I don't like this fuckin' guy.
It's Germans!
Good shooting, Danny!
The Colonel helped me work it out.
Sorry you're gonna die -- cause I'm gonna make it.
They'll turn the ship into the wind before we launch.  That'll help.
We'll get separated over the target, but you and I will rendezvous for the run to China.  I'm on your wing.
What about easier to hit in an air raid?
Tell me something, Dorie.  A man as big as you -- and smart too, you knew where to come when your ship couldn't help -- do you still have to fight with your fists to get respect?
Oh, this is Betty.
Have the planes made it to China?
What does Grandma think you do at your meetings?
I hope so. At least I got to see you and Grandma.  Has it ever worked before?
Where were you? You said you'd be back at twelve.
r was worried about you  You didn't even call. You're always on my case if I don't call..
I feel ridiculous. Maybe I should go home and change.
Carol!
You just have to remember... men are like houses and trade upwards... I thought you had a pretty good marriage.
It's not the place. I don't buy that.  Trapped in the same town forever. The price she would pay for her teenage lust.
After you got knocked up, my mother didn't want me to talk to you. She thought it was contagious.
I can't. It's all too much.
You're kidding...? Carol, you have beautiful hair.
It's that jerk Walter.
Lucky lady. Hi.
Can you believe I want to marry that dork.
Come off it, Peggy. And what do you mean your house? This is my house. I paid for it, I'm still paying for it.
Not now, Charlie. I've got a headache. Get used to the word. Roll it around your tongue for a years.
It's not going to be forever. I figure three years is long enough. I can see it the music pans out.  And right after graduation we should start seeing other people. Kind of comparison shop before we settle down and get married. Know what I mean?
Well, we got the prom coming up, all these parties. We shouldn't upset our parents?
Looking good out there.
Where did you get that sweater?
Is he gonna help you with that physics stuff?
What are you doing here?
I bumped into him after you dropped me off Last night. I didn't feel like going home, so we went for a ride.
And why do you always refer to yourself in the third person, like Napoleon? How come it always turns into an argument with you?
I will be happy if I have you. I love you.
I'm trying to save you years of frustration... waiting for a big break... no. Waiting for that big disappointment so you could blame it all on me.
Well, how about a walk, Charlie Bell..
What were You doing there? You never told me you were singing with an R and B group.
Not exactly, but with your great voice, it'll be a huge hit. Honest.
I love you.
Do you think anybody in the Fifties ever made love on a bed?
What about Janet?
I loved you since the day I met you, and I haven't stopped.
Hello, Charlie.
We think this party might cheer her up. Just make sure you know what's expected of you.
I beg your pardon?
Terry, slow down.
But I'm remembering the future.
It was Beth's idea.
No, I just made that up. Do you want to hear one?
Now listen, this is the plan. As soon as school is finished we go to Utah and...
You're so young, this is not the time to start acquiring bad habits.
Dad.. it's not a big deal. Didn't you ever stay out all night when you were young?
I've heard just about enough of this lunacy! Go to your room!
For me?
I wanted to apologize for this morning.
It's hard to believe you're going to be eighteen.  Want an eskimo pie? Or a creamsicle? I'd come home from the store and there's little you running up to me. I'd give you a dime and you'd promise never to grow up.
He'll win.
Peggy Sue, watch your mouth.
I have a note.
Why don't you go lie down for a while.
Would you get that, dear?
Sheerotards. Catchy name, isn't it? Like leotards.
What are you doing?
Not to me they don't. I'm going to win the State, then the. Nationals, and then I'm going to the Olympics.
Are you Peggy Sue Kelcher?
Hello. Nice to meet you. Please call me Peggy. I'm Peggy Bodell now.
Well, you showed them. You're rich and famous and successful. And you have a beautiful wife.
You were always friendly to me. I appreciated that.  You know, this used to be a fantasy of mine.
What was?
You're a sweet man, Richard.
I have to talk to you. It's very important.
I	know what a burrito is.
I'd be very careful if I were you. You don' t want to fall into the clutches of some madman with plans to manipulate your brain.
Wbat're you talking about?
What are you talking about?
What are you doing?
What do you know about hypnosis?
Will you take of f your blouse?
I think it has something to do with your birthday. You were rambling. I didn't understand the rest.
What's the matter?
Vision? I'm a walking anachronism! I've upset my parents. I miss my kids. I could be trapped here forever! And poor Charlie...I got pregnant on my 18th birthday and we had to get married. Tomorrow's my birthday! I've got to get out of here now.
Wait! I'll go with you!
The Creed cat, that's right. Bastard's name was "Church".  Let me guess. Your dog's tissue isn't healing, pupils aren't dilating... maybe you can't find a heartbeat?
Wait, there must be some mix-up. He was... the dog is alive.
I'm real excited about working for you Mr. Matthews...
What happened to you?
All set?
Damn dog stuck his nose in on my rabbits and they ganged up on him. I swear that dog's an idiot.
I've never seen anybody punch Clyde before.
You shouldn't ever say that about your parents, not even your Dad.
I'm not burying him here...
What do you mean?
In a word, Bob...
K-R-O-one.
You're right, I probably just misfiled...
Perhaps... you're right. I've certainly been busy. With the Kronos complaint, a preliminary injunction hearing and the Saunders trial all falling at the same time...
Excuse me, Charles. With all due respect... this is... preposterous! It doesn't make any sense, it sounds as if we're talking about someone else. Pardon the lack of humility, but I've had the distinct impression I was kind of... one of the rising stars around here. And I feel that wasn't just my imagination. And I also think I deserve to know what's really going on here, Charles.
Don't apologize for me.
Jerk... What did you say?
What's wrong with you?
I'm not going to close the--
You want me to give up? Let this thing turn us into <u>victims</u>?
Whoa-oh!  Sorry, I...
Continue.
Continue.
Hell, they are staring. What's that shit on your face?
The partner who spotted the lesion, Walter Kenton, used to work for Benton, Myers, in D.C. There's a paralegal there, Maria Torres. She's had lesions on and off for three years. She says it was common knowledge around the office that her lesions were caused by AIDS.
There is no relevant precedent.
Thank you for sharing that with me, Joe.
When you refer to Wheeler, call him Charles, to show how you'd been admitted to the inner circle, you were considered one of them.
Uh huh...
I've made provisions in my will for some charities. Miguel will need a lawyer. I know it's not your area...
I suppose you could say that.
No. I didn't.
Are you a good lawyer?
I'm an excellent lawyer.
What makes you an excellent lawyer?
What do you call a thousand lawyers chained together at the bottom of the ocean?
Something like that.
Do men have sex with each other in that theater?
When? Approximately what year did this event take place?
That is <u>not</u> correct. I never lied about it.
Do you have any lesions on your face at this time?
Hello?
Were you recently promoted?
In what way?
Apparently, Mr. Wheeler felt they were too... "ethnic" is the word she used. She said he would like it if I wore something smaller, less garish, and... more "American."
Objection!
The guy sat in my office! You can't get AIDS that way, right?
But he's got lots of other people's lives to ruin...
What kind of people?
What's the matter with you? Do I look gay to you?
You load the film... ? No, on this side... or this side? Don't move the baby!
How many gays do you know?
Allright. I admit it: I'm prejudiced. I don't want to work with a homosexual. You got me.
Have you changed your aftershave?
Yeah... ?
Going on... like...?
<u>She</u> didn't try to conceal it.
But didn't you avoid contact with Ms. Torres, after you found out she had AIDS? She says you acted repulsed by her and you avoided her, is that correct?
In this courtroom, Mr. Miller, justice is blind. To matters of race, creed, color, religion. And sexual orientation.
With all due respect, Your Honor... We don't live in this courtroom, do we?
It's good to be King, hey Charles?
Gonna lose everybody out here....
Okay, it was me. What'd I do now?
Bottle-count.
Fairly fuckin' ironic, wouldn't you say? Slamlight's so dim that you go and get your eyeballs taken out and shined up -- then you wind up here. Three ass-kick suns.  Maybe I did do a few people. But not this one. No ma'am, not this time.
They're coming.
An' now you're worried about a repeat of history?
What about her?
Tell me the settlement is right there! RIDDICK, PLEASE!
Don't do this to me....
Just a suggestion, but perhaps we should flee.
...one cutting torch...one handlight here, two more in the cabin...I <u>think</u> two more....
Possibly.
Big Evil?
Better keep moving....
You see anybody else here? Just between you and me.
Let's wait on the power cells.
May've noticed chains don't work on this guy. Only way we're truly safe is if he believes he's goin' free. But if he <u>stops</u> believin' --
You mean, if he learns that you're gonna royally fuck him over.
You have a little caffeine in the morning, I have a little morphine. So what?
And here you got two mornings every day. Wow, were you <u>born</u> lucky?
How much you weigh, Johns?
-- tried to kill us in our sleep. Paris had it right -- we <u>are</u> disposable. We're just walking ghosts to her.
Owens!
Chrislam teaches that once in every lifetime should there be a great hajj -- a great pilgrimage. To know God, better, yes, but to know yourself as well.
They're afraid of our light. That means we don't have to be so afraid of them.
I would rather we all stay--
Well...we must keep her close, then. Here, she'll be safe if we put her between --
Here's the deal. You work without the chains, without the bit -- without the shivs. You help us get off this rock....
My recommendation: Do me. Don't take the chance that I'll get shiv-happy on your wannabe ass. Ghost me, Riddick. Would if I were you.
Don't wanna feed these land-sharks -- just keep 'em off our scent.
Aw, don't tell me you're growin' scruples.
You were tryin' to kill him too.
Take it.
To the diggings I worked at a year ago. It's a three day ride across the eastern desert, near where you claim you landed from that planet of yours.
Sorry, Taylor. The terrain around that lake is poisonous. There is no fresh water, no vegetation. Nothing.
Look -- she remembers.
Remembers what?
But what about your theory? The existence of someone like Taylor might prove it.
No.
Well, at least they haven't tried to bite us.
But the quota system's been abolished! You made it. Why can't I?
But I'm not prepared to die.
Lucius.
You asked for the opportunity to present your case. Surely you must know why you're here.
It says here that his name is Bright Eyes. You gave him that name yourself.
You destroyed his memory! His mind! His identity! And, you want to do the same to me!
Thats a lie!
'I have come to you from a planet in a different solar system. I am an explorer in space, with no hostile intentions against your civilization. On my planet it was the primate Man who evolved Into a thinking animal, while the apes remained..."
What about it?
Then you admit --
Thank you for calling me Taylor.  Dr. Zaius, I know who I am. Who are you? How did this upside down civilization ever get started?
You may well call it upside down, since you occupy its lowest level. And deservedly.  The eastern desert has never been explored -- because we've always assumed that no life can exist there.  Save yourself, Taylor. Tell me -- is there another jungle beyond the Forbidden Zone?
If you are protecting others of your kind, it will cost you your identity.
Tell him to pull back!
Because you are a man. And you were right -- I have always known about man. From the evidence, I believe his wisdom must walk hand in hand with his idiocy. His emotions must rule his brain. He must be a warlike animal who gives battle to everything around him -- even himself.
Which one?
He's moving his fingers!
This is his assertion.
Say I can dig it. Smoke that shit everything kinda gets weird y'know?  Y'hear that story the gooks is putting chemicals in the grass so's we become 'pacifists' so's we don fight  Where the hell's everybody, they'se gettin high that's what - bunch of hopheads, they think they special...
Yeah, you had a piece of pussy on a plate in front of you, you'd probably kill it.
Does he have a metal plate in his head?
Fuck this shit!
Where's Lerner?
Come on man!
Feel good?
And you, do you believe?
In '65 - yeah. Now...  No. What happened today's just the beginning. We're gonna lose this war...
I volunteered.
Way out of anything, man. Just keep your pecker up, your powder dry, the worm WILL turn. How many days you short?
So what am I going to do! Get one of my guys zapped so some fuckface fresh from the World can get his beauty fucking sleep!
Sounds pretty far out to me 'Lias.
Not the only man to meet his Jezebel either.
And Baaaaaaa! back on you.
Begging your pardon Lieutenant but my holes are far enuff apart you could run a regiment through there and nobody'd see them - I got five live bodies left...
That's right. I don't want to hear about it 'cause to tell you the truth, I don't give a shit okay... I just don't give a shit anymore.
You could tell me your name. And where you're going.
Or Reno?  They always throw them off the bridge there, I've heard.
Dine and dance tonight? I've got fifty bucks to throw away.
Not tonight.
What's the matter?
We have some nice places around Vancouver.
I think I'd like to dance.
Please be a little more careful how you talk, Mr. Mitchell.
Much too late.
They'll know whether he killed himself.
How did you meet him?
You tried to run away.
Is this the best you can do?
Want to dance?
Killaine's not that sort of guy. He said no--he meant no.
That's the second round I've lost tonight.  That fellow hurt me.
No percentage in that.
I run over to Victoria.  Play some golf with some people I know.  Do it all the time.  That's why I have a cabin cruiser.  Custom- built.Forty knots.  Mr Clark Brandon an almost gentleman of almost complete leisure.  Member of six golf clubs.  Broke 70 once on the Shaughnessy Heights Course.  You have to be good to do that, And if you look out of a front window of the Empress Hotel in Victoria, in a few hours you can look right down on Mr. Brandon's boat, the Valkyrie.  Came alone?  Sure.  He always comes alone.  Mr Brandon's a rather lonely man.
And Betty Mayfield--
I thought you had to be back to the hotel.  To leave my--my note.
Including Killaine...I still can't think of you that way.
That man that was following us last night--he didn't come back this morning.  I'm beginning to wonder about him, too.  Was he really following me--or you?
Magruder obliged me.  No use my saying it wasn't planned that way. I had to clean up.  I'm not a dumb- smart college boy anymore.  Nobody in the world would believe I didn't plan the whole thing.
You'll never make it.  You've out- smarted yourself.
Yes.  Yours.  You haven't murdered anybody.  You killed Mitchell. Wasn't that an accident?  It must have been.  If you kill a blackmailer, you kill him dead--so that he can't talk anymore.
But the next one is murder.  First the little step, then the longer step , and then the step you can never take back.  You could tell about Mitchell.  You could tell about Magruder--and the detective. It would hurt, but you could do it.  You could never tell about me.
Every day of your life you'll want me.  You'll never get over it. Every time you see your face in the mirror--
Me?
Do you think I was faking?
Mrs. West is a very emotional woman.
You probably know the type. You find them in hotels and resorts all over the world. They always have clothes, and money, and usually have had three or four husbands. They dress and enamel themselves with great care. They worry a great deal about those little lines at the corner of the eyes.. And they demonstrate their incompetence at the art of living bet getting mixed up with people like Larry Mitchell.  Tell me about yourself, Miss Mayfield.
Regimental! Seaforth Highlanders.
Where's you get it?
An unhappy marriage hardly seems a sufficient reason for that.
Good morning, Mr. Killaine. I'm sorry I can't give you the name of my bank--because I have no bank at the moment.  That was a crude trick.
But not in the investigation of a major crime, I hope.
Palm trees against a sunset--waves breaking on a coral reef--the Taj Mahal by moonlight--roses in an English garden, just after a shower--  Clichs, one and all--but good ones, with a lot of mileage left in them--there's one thing he does not see--murder--and murder was what he was sent to find.  Pretty ridiculous, isn't it?
What do your friends call you?-- The ones that know you well?--and like you very much?
Jeff.  Shall we go now, Jeff, and get it over with?
So Mitchell had handled it. Afterwards, Brandon picked it up.  There's no indication you handled it.
Because you think your in love with me?
Mr. Reed, please, for Mr.  Brandon.  Very well. Have him call. Mr. Brandon is in his office now.  Mr. Reed stepped out, Mr.  Brandon.
I'd like a few words with you, in private.
You asked for it.
A thousand.
Leave that one lay.
Who told you my name?
The usual grind.
Hardly. Who's the girl?
Thank you.
I rather thought so. And before that, had you ever seen the gun?
How about a cup of coffee?
Thanks.  Lovely view you have, haven't you?
Not if she knew she wouldn't be believed.
You do a lot of real estate trading, Brandon?
Now and then.  Mostly just for the fun of it.
What's the matter, baby. Don't you like me anymore?
Lay off, can't you?
They'll arrest that girl. Everything points to her.
Nastiness. You're nasty with words. Why wouldn't you be nasty with deeds once in a while? You hated him--and I know why.
Catch me at the Vancouver Royal if it's important.
Magruder's conked out.  Adrenaline injections, oxygen tent.  He may come out of it and he may not.  As a source of quick information, we can't forget him.
Mr. Brandon couldn't be here.  He might have left something for you. What would it look like?
What do I get for it?
You in charge here?
I knew him. He was easy to dislike, poor chap.
Right. A clean deduction from observed facts. They've got to be simple once in a while, Inspector.
I've handled it.  Mitchell's handed it.  If I wipe it off, no suicide. If I take it out and lose it, no suicide.  If I leave it here....no suicide.
And she did give him the chance, the way it worked out.
Oh, the Coldstream Guards.  Don't you take your hat off in elevators?
I never saw it before.
I was in love with him... which shows you the quality of my brains.  Why don't you ask her about the gun?
Then why not give Miss Mayfield the benefit of the doubt?
Try Betty Mayfield.  The Mitchell case.
This gun permit was issued to Clark Brandon?
Which forces me to arrest her against my better judgment.
Nor I. This is why I gave it to you.
What are my orders, sir?
Nice.
She's just a girl I met on the train. You don't mind do you?
Why should I mind?
Rich? I haven't the faintest idea. Why?
That's not very kind.
It's fine, thank you.
History books are first onto the bonfires.
So I can go ahead and be a historian without feeling like a poseur.I shall be fulfilling a citizen's duty.
You're kind to be so encouraging.
I do worry about Susan.  Have you known her long?  She hasn't mentioned you.
Then I began to listen to what the well-off were saying about the poor now  the war had just ended, and the language was much the same as it had been before the first Reform Act.  A small minority thought that England was really theirs, they had made it, they owned it.  The rest, the wage earners, were foreigners, outsiders intent on wrecking it all.
Charles!  I didn't know you were back.  Have a good holiday?
Committed to memory.  Forever.
...break away completely from--
And some of that.  Sorry.
Personally James, I'm very excited by this new arrangement we have. It gives us direct access to literally hundreds of American collages.  Twentieth century history is a growth area over there, don't ask me why.  Your readership will be first and second year American collage students...
Thank you.
I quite liked it.  I wasn't as enthusiastic as everyone else.
I called you a taxi.
I haven't really thought about it.
I haven't seen much of you.
Jeremy, just let me see what you've got.
That's enough of that.
The torture of small children--
On the torture of very small children, but don't start telling them about their rights--
Delivering gossip and goodwill. It seems we'll both be doing Brighton.  Perhaps you should come too.
Big mistake, I think.  You might have learned a lot.
Hello.
I'm terribly sorry.  He doesn't seem to be here ... No ... Yes, if I see him, I will. .. Goodbye. She's going to phone back.
I'll tell you another thing.  We might have led the world once into the Industrial Revolution, now we lead with television commercials. We're the best, it's as simple as that.  Even the Americans will admit it now ... the camera work, the acting, the scripts, special effects.  We've got the lot.  Nearly all the good directors here have ambitions to make serious films.  That food you're eating.
I dunno.  Ploughman's Lunch.
Jeremy!  How Fantastic.
You'd look naked without one.
It was incredible.  He came back, made a pompous little bow and said, 'My dear girl you may film me all afternoon if you wish.' And he's promised not to talk to the Press.
Gonna be some people at my house tonight.  Maybe you can make it.
Utah, you copy bruddah?
What's this?
We're wasting time.
But you're not alone.
Look, Bodhi man.  People are dead. The ride is over.
No games, Bodhi.  Pull the cord! Now!!
And I always knew I could count on you, Agent Utah.
1322 last year in LA county.  Up 26 percent from the year before.
What?
Cole and Munoz?  I been on this case for two years.
So you're gonna coast to retirement, when you could nail these guys and go out with come dignity.
Angelo, pay attention.  There's gonna be a test afterward.  Lab is showing traces of toxins.  PCBs. Heavy elements... selenium, titanium and arsenic.
The beaches are always being closed because of waste spills, right?  And surfers are territorial.  They stick mostly to certain breaks.  If we can get some hair samples, and get a match to a certain beach, we'd know which break the Ex-Presidents surf. You buyin' this?
I say we don't call it in.  Under no circumstance are we to call this in.
Catch of the day.
People are expendable to Bodhi.
I... I don't know.  I can't describe what I'm feeling.
So what'd the other guy look like?
Carefully, tough guy.  Very carefully.
Major, looks like there were ten, maybe twelve guerrillas. Looks like they took some prisoners from the chopper.  Then a different set of track, over there.
I knew this man. Green Berets, out of Fort Bragg. What the hell were they doing in here? You got any answers for this, Dillon?
She's too valuable. She's got to know their whole network. The whole set up. We take her with us.
We're still too far in, they won't risk coming in for us.
We're going to need everyone.
Any sign of the hostages?
You lift off in three hours.  There's one other thing.
What's that, General?
Major, you'd better take a look at this.
Where the hell is his body?
I dunno.  Do thigh high, leather boots go with a cocktail dress?
Mr. Harris, we know you've purchased at least twenty percent of our stock.  We also know you plan to file a formal bid for a majority share.
Congratulations, sir.
No.  What I have is a lot of money.
What I did with those companies was perfectly legal.
How are you, Mr. Kross.
Uh, no.  How do I get to Beverly Hills?
Sure.  For five bucks.
Mind if I turn on some heat?
Very good.  You're obviously mechanical.
What's your name?
What do you want it to be?  Vivian, my name's Vivian.
Must be dangerous.  Hooking.
Tell me about it.  L.A. is suffering from a wacko epidemic. And who knows where half the guys I pick up have been.  I mean, I use condoms.  Always.  And I get checked out once a month at the free clinic.  Not only am I better in the sack than an amateur, I'm probably safer.
You're joking.
I never joke about money.
What's your name, lover.
Every place has hookers, but if this hotel has hookers, they don't look like they're...
Off the boulevard.
Room service.  What do you drink?
Want to know something?  I don't quite know.  I hadn't planned this.
Where are they?  Shopping together?
Because they bring out the flavor of the champagne.
Jesus, you act like you're seducing some Valley girl you picked up in a dance club.
You really are a very beautiful girl.
Yeah.  Too good.  I forgot where I was.
Where'd you go?
Oooh, Baby, you were the best. I was beside myself.
So what a ya do with the companies once you buy'm?
What are assets?
Look butthead, I'll treat you so nice you'll never want to let me go, okay?
You're upset, huh?
Upset.  No.  I never get upset about business.
Television?
Well, you know those cold bitches that work in those stores and try to intimidate you?  It works.
You're really pushing it, bringing me here.
What id we run into someone I know?
Real genuine guy.
I don't know what you're talking about.
What was I supposed to do?  I told the truth.  Why should the truth upset you?  It's not as if you're from a convent.
Shush.  Of course you can.
I'll whisper some of the main parts of the story to you.  But you'll be surprised how much you understand.  The music conveys the story more powerfully than any words.
But don't they have it in English?
If you'd gone on about how much you liked it, I'm not sure I'd have believed you.
Edward, did you hear me?
Bill, I'd like you to meet Vivian.
Fill me in on this.  How'd you and Vivian meet?
She met him at dinner last night... I like this tie.
Looks slow tonight.
I can't handle this tonight. I'm going home.
Hey Kit, where do I go for the clothes?  Good stuff on <u>him</u>.
Who did you think?
I know.  I stopped pretending and started liking it with him for real.
Oooh, I love those.
That's all right.  I'm sure they're quite lovely.
Edward is taking me to some fancy place for dinner.  The Rex.  Ever been there?
Yeah, mine too.  Is it like, y'know, normal?
You'll like it fine.
You're not accompanying him to New York?
Yes.  Something... conservative.
Would you like to try it on?
Get out!
You never sent the ships. Don't bother lying. It doesn't matter. Westley will come for me anyway.
Should I be?
You admit to me you do not love your fiance?
Rest, Highness.
I fear I'll never see you again.
We'll never survive.
I got married. I didn't want to. It all happened so fast.
Did you say, "I do"?
And a good thing too.
Why should that make such a difference?
You don't look so good.  You don't smell so good either.
-- what? --
To find the Man in Black, obviously.
Where did you get that?
That's right. When I was your age, television was called books. And this is a special book. It was the book my father used to read to me when I was sick, and I used to read it to your father. And today, I'm gonna read it to you.
It doesn't sound too bad. I'll try and stay awake.
It was a very emotional time for Buttercup --
You want me to read this or not?
Who kills Prince Humperdinck? At the end, somebody's got to do it. Is it Inigo? Who?
No, it's kissing again. You don't want to hear it.
Yellin.
It won't be easy, Sire.
Ah, but how will you capture us? We know the secrets of the Fire Swamp. We can live there quite happily for some time. So, whenever you feel like dying, feel free to visit.
Now, where is that secret knot? It's impossible to find.  Are you coming down into the Pit? Westley's got his strength back. I am starting him on The Machine tonight.
And it is guarded by sixty men.
Now, mostly dead is slightly alive. Now, all dead...well, with all dead, there's usually only one thing that you can do.
But I promise I will not kill you until you reach the top.
We'll wait until you're ready.
You're amazing!
Get used to disappointment.
He's climbing the rope. And he's gaining on us.
He didn't fall? Inconceivable!!
I'm afraid so -- I can't compete with you physically. And you're no match for my brains.
-- get back, witch --
How would you like to go back to teasing hair, big mouth?
Roger, do you mind if we talk a little business?
Congratulations.
Go!  You have fifty-eight seconds.
Mr. Bialystock ...
Where?  What?
Yes.  Right.  Good thinking.  You figure it out.  I'm tired.  I'm gonna take a little nap.  Wake me if there's a fire.
Aha, aha, aha, aha, aha, aha!!  So, in order for the scheme to work, we'd have to find a sure fire flop.
Oh, I fell on my keys.  I've got to get out of here.
You're going to jump on me.  I know you're going to jump on me -- like Nero jumped on Poppea.
Don't touch me!  Don't touch me!
Okay ... Max!  And you can call me Leo.
Where would you like to eat?
It won't run a week!
They'll say, "Oooh, wah, wah, wah, ooh, ooh."
Stop talking like that, you white mouse!  Nothing's going to go wrong. As a matter of fact, today I have taken steps to insure total disaster. At two o'clock we have an appointment with none other than Roger De Bris.
Do you think he'll take the job?
No way out.  No way out.  What?  Who?
Vhy do you persecute me?  My papers are in order.  I love my country.  "Oh, beautiful for spacious skies, For amber vaves of grain."
Vat about it?
Franz, trust me.  I promise I won't let you down.
Vhere?  Vhere?... oh...
You crazy lunatic!  What are you shooting at us for?  Why don't you use this  where it will do us some good?  Why don't you shoot the actors?  Liebkind, have I ever steered you wrong?
You mean you had the slow fuse in your pocket all the time and you forgot to put it on?
Do you need us?
Ulla, I'd like you to meet my partner and associate, Mr. Leo Bloom.
Don't forget the checkee.  Can't produce playees without checkees.
Smasheroo.  Smasheroo.
Of Siegfried...
Nietzche...
Bismark...
Lorenzo Saint DuBois.  But everybody calls me LSD.
Oh, sing.  Sing!
Where's Goebbels?  Where's my little Joe?
I'm looking for a missing person.  My name's Arbogast, private investigator...  Trying to trace a young girl who's been missing almost a week. From Phoenix.  It's a private matter... family wants to forgive her...  She isn't in trouble.
I'm not the police.
She might have used an alias. Mary Crane's the real name, but she might've registered...
Oh. My private parlor. She had an awful hunger... so I made her some supper. And then she went to bed and left in the morning. I didn't even see her leave.
How did she pay you?
Cash.
I do mind. If it don't jell, it ain't aspic!  This ain't jelling.
What's your interest?
You came up here on a hunch, Miss Crane? Nothing more? No phone call... from him, or from your sister herself?
Can I trade in my car and take another?
Five hundred.
I think you'd better give it a trial spin. Don't want any bad word of mouth about California Charlie.
No, M'am. I was only about to say, I've sent my mechanic out to give your car a little test... that's all.
Aren't you going to take the pills?  They'll knock that headache out.
Caroline...? Mary still isn't in?
Will you help us? I think something's wrong out there!
Did he say anything about my sister?
Is something wrong?
With you.
Last Friday. She left work, and home... I was in Tucson over the weekend... I haven't heard from her, not even a phone call.
I just listened... and believed everything they told me. 'She stole the money.' 'We don't want to get her in trouble.' 'No don't bring the police in'...
No. The man whose money she... he talked so loud and fast, and I... I should've called the police.
Who's he?
Bates never denied Mary was here.
Why not?
We could laze around here a while longer.
I've heard of married couples who deliberately spend occasional nights in cheap hotels. They say it...
Sam!
I'm sorry, Mary.  My old Dad used to say 'when you can't change a situation, laugh at it.' Nothing ridicules a thing like laughing at it.
You couldn't be a criminal if you committed a major crime.
I wish I were. Not an active criminal but... a nice guy with the conscience of a criminal.  Next best thing to no conscience at all.
You know what I'd like? A clear, empty sky... and a plane, and us in it... and somewhere a private island for sale, where we can run around without our... shoes on.  And the wherewithal to buy what I'd like.  Mary, you want to cut this off, go out and find yourself someone available.
Sometimes we deliberately step into those traps.
To a private island, like you?
It's too late for me. And besides... who'd look after her? She'd be alone up there, the fire would go out... damp and cold, like a grave. When you love someone, you don't do that to them, even if you hate them. Oh, I don't hate her.  I hate... what she's become. I hate... the illness.
Alright, Miss... 
Crane.
That's it. 
No, m'am.
Of course not! Am I acting as if... something's wrong?
Is there what?  I've told you there's nothing wrong... except that I'm in a hurry and you're taking up my time...
Sorry, Mrs. Chambers. I hate bothering you...
We have a problem.
He traced her there and called us to say he was going to question Mrs. Bates...
Maybe you saw Mary!
It ain't only local history, Sam, it's the only murder-and-suicide case in Fairvale ledgers! Mrs. Bates poisoned this guy she was... involved with, when she found out he was married, then took a helping of the same stuff herself.  Strychnine. Ugly way to die.
Yes, matter of fact.  The wife's taking a nap and... I can never keep quiet enough for her... so I thought I'd look you up and... talk.
Do what?
...Forty thousand dollars!
Mother, she's just a stranger... hungry, and the weather's bad...
He was out when I was there. If he's back he probably isn't even in bed yet.
No, not exactly. Why the great anxiety? It must be something important.
He's inherited a fortune.
Gosh, you had me fooled.
No-
But where do the rats come in?
By the way, where <U>is</U> your assistant?
Well, news of Buckley?
Why, Buckley stole that body. That's what alarmed Mrs. Buckley so. I have been try- ing to get her to put Buckley in an institution but she wants to keep him.
Take me down there.
It won't do any good. They are a pair of would-be mur- deresses fighting it out.
I'm going to call the police.
The wound is bleeding!
You're losing your blood?
Yes.
The blood transfusion continues. Marc has positioned himself outside the circle of light from the lamp, so that he can see Nikolas in bright light, while he himself sits in the dark. Nikolas watches Lone's face anxiously and closely during her struggle with death. Life slowly seems to return to her, and her breathing becomes more peaceful. She opens her eyes and looks at the people round her, but she is much too enfeebled to speak, and closes her eyes again. Marc keeps a close watch on Nikolas, who grows paler and paler. His eyes swivel slowly from Nikolas to the patient and back to Nikolas again.
I don't see any big-moneyed boys running after you.
I've been in love so many times my heart is calloused ... but I've never hit one with dough. This love-in-an-attic isn't my idea of a way to spend a pleasant afternoon.
Ouch! Eat? You can do a solo if you don't step on it. I'm going to bow out on you.
What's the rush? There's no first act. They'll all be there and we don't have to appear at any particular time.
I'd call it stupid at any time.
If you will forgive this poor, crippled stump, my dear, I am very happy to know you.
Hello, Express. What's the idea, trying to outsmart the police?
Not a very good one, I guess. He wasn't like anything human. He hobbled and swayed like a monkey, and the face, from the glimpse I got of it in the light from the street, was like an African war mask.
Hey, what do you think you're doing? Put that stuff back!
Why the goose pimples? If he wasn't social register -- if it was somebody like me, you'd be trying to hang him.
Oh, you won't -- you were pretty tough about Judge Ramsey -- a little while ago --
Or was bumped off by someone who was afraid of him.
Come in, Prussic Acid. What's on your mind?
I want to see the original pictures of Joan Gale.
I am right! I know I'm right!
No kiddin'?
Listen, stupid, could I do anything that would possibly meet with your approval?
No, sir, I'm sure it wasn't there.
How's every little thing?
Yes, she committed suicide yesterday. That's not news. I heard about it last year.
Oh, yeah? Maybe she didn't commit suicide. She may have been murdered!
What does that prove?
Gee, honey-bunch, I'm sorry -- I'm going to have to disappoint you.
Your dad has stood for plenty. Now let's get down to cases. When did you see the Dale girl last?
They didn't give me a chance. We had a couple of drinks and she was all right then. She seemed happy.
We planned a trip for her. I was going to send her to Bermuda.
Stolen! What are you trying to do to me? ... You're working with the police! ... You're trying to make me say something that can be used against me! You're trying ...
Now look here. It's not up to us to do our own detective work. I've had enough trouble over this matter. I don't want anything more to do with it.
Not even if it gives you a clean bill of health?
Please. I'm sorry. I'll see it through. What do you want me to do?
Good night, sir.
What are you laughing at?
To isolation.  To an armed camp.  To a biblical spoof of a crazed father firing a gun at his only son.
You did.
What?
Then you get it.  You'll understand.
What terrible thing in Cave Springs?
All right, that's enough.  You're just a child and wouldn't understand it, but that type of thing can stir a girl up. Now lie back and we'll talk.
It was softer'n I thought, that was my main impression. You know, if you hit a girl there it would hurt her a lot.
You know, Buddy, sometimes I can't figure you out at all. You can be very nice, but like your mother said there's an evil streak in you.
Most men wouldn't do what he done. If they can get a girl they go right ahead and get her -- I guess to hell they do, just like a dern rabbit. 'Course later they'll tell her she's no good when they done the same thing their selves. They're a bunch of monkeys. I like 'em, but they're a bunch of monkeys.
I hate to turn on this light, you Daddy's awake downstairs, but I have to take the chance.  Buddy, please don't tell on me.
Oh, he's so kind, so gentle inside, and so unhappy with that rich wife who doesn't understand him, her being a Southerner and everything, and what a bedside manner he has got -- so gentle and kind beneath the professor way he acts!
Rose, you are too uncritical of people.
You won't die, Rose.
Yeah, I know.
I do, too!
He did lie, and... and... and Mother, yesterday he stole money out of your pocketbook!
Is that Doctor still up there, Brother.
You mean confirmed, Mother. I didn't confirm it before. I would have had to confirm it previously, in order for it to be reconfirmed.
Uhhh, gahdam stuff!
No, you didn't say that, Brother.
Heh, what a hypocrite.
Now I have a plan about Rose, an educational plan. She's getting better and we don't want any more trouble --  Brother, you ought to hear this.
Now I can't see. What are they doing?
He kissed her.
A baby... and she isn't even married.
The pitiful son of a bitch said Rose was a nymphomaniac.
It always gives me a funny feeling to come home. Dear old Southland. Gone. It's all gone, Daddy --  -- except you, you're still here.
But... but how? She was young! Rose wasn't old!
Well, you have knocked me for a hell of a loop, old man. A hell of a loop.
The point is you don't grow up like that on a diet of sorghum and hominy grits. She got protein somewhere, she's a very strong girl and I think she'll live... despite the delay in medical treatment.
Please do.
What?
Oh. Did you say something?
Well, let's hope for the best, darlin'.
Be kind to her. She loves you so much.  In a perfectly proper way, of course.
Forgive my crudity, darlin'. All I'm saying is that a girl who would wear clothes like that is going to get in trouble sooner or later.
You certainly are! She has an awful toothache, look at her jaw, it's all swollen.
Just a moment! You are not going to fire this girl for an innocent thing like having boy friends, not while there is breath in my body!
Well, she does seem to cause a lot of trouble, I admit. But she doesn't mean any harm and it'll break the children's hearts, they all love her.
How could Rose really be a bad influence on Dolly? She has a loving nature, you ought to want someone like that around your children. Why do you think those boys and men like her?
I can't stand that polecat. They ought to hang him.
She already told you, she doesn't know.
Ah, ha! Hold the phone! No forwarding address, huh?  In the shock of this brilliant move, I forgot something.
Well, I... I hadn't thought about it that much. I was thinking... well, it's an idea, the girl is oversexed, and...
How is she?
It's twenty after one.
Well, thank God we are rid of her at last. And the best thing of all is that she's happy. The little nut is happy, she found Mr. Right in the nick of time!
Rosebaby Blossom, these are the most delicious candied yams I ever ate! Why, they just melt in my mouth. And this fried chicken is fit for a king. How do you do it, Peachbird? What is the secret of your art, Plum Blossom, huh?
All right, all right. Now calm down, Rose, the children will hear you. Calm down, let's talk... about this thing, let's discuss it.
Oh, I know. She's so sweet, she's been so good to me...
Is this ill right?
Yes, sir.
Boy, for four or five days there I didn't think I'd live. But I'm my old self again!
Umm. Well. Yes. But no more strange voices in the night, Rose.
Well, Mr. Hillyer, Billy's very poor, he don't have no money and there wasn't no place else to go.
Tennessee?
Mine.
Yes, mine. I'm going to have one.
All right, tell us, Rose, what makes you think you're pregnant?
I don't believe it.
Well, I am in the construction business, Buddy, and without braggin' I have done real good at it.  There are those who wouldn't have expected that out of me.  Right now I'm buildin' a giant motel unit near Alexandria, outside Washington, D.C. Not fi-nance, I'm on the construction side.
Heh heh heh heh, same old Buddy, always jokin' around. Almost as much of a joker as your Daddy.  I saw your Daddy a coupla years ago, I was up in Glenville lookin' at a motel site. I guess that's where you're headed, huh, to see him?
She didn't marry him, though, later she married another guy and went to Winston-Salem. It didn't last That girl couldn't have no lastin' marriage, she left him and married another dumb sucker and went out west. Little bitch left him, too, and you know what she's married to right now?  A kike. That's right, some kind of kike horse doctor named Schapiro out in Seattle, who's got the nerve to have the same first name I got. Wouldn't you know it, Rose would wind up married to a goddamn kike? She was always out of her friggin' head and I'll tell you why.  Buddy, she was sick in her mind and between her legs, too. She was a nymphomaniac.
Well, Mrs. Hillyer, the girl is strong as an ox and that is what is keeping her alive. But not many people walk away from double pneumonia, Madam, not many.
Yes, go on.
What are you talking about? I don't understand all this mumbo jumbo and the funny looks on your faces.
Well, she finally let me look in her mouth. Is it true she's never been to a dentist?
That would scare her to death. She's terrified of hospitals. To her, a hospital is where you go to die.
Rose, this is Waski. His real name is Warren but we call him Waski. He doesn't like it much and I suppose someday we'll have to stop calling him that.
Well, you run on now.
Well, there's no reason you shouldn't go out, Rose... in moderation.
I'm looking at this poster, and I'm thinkin', I don't remember seeing films like this when I was in school.
What Eve and I wouldn't give to meet up with you on the business end of a daisy chain.
You get nothing and like it.  And if we're not blissfully happy with what you tell us, we arrest you just for the fun of it.
And... ?
What do you want?  I'm clean.  I been clean a long time.
I need the "when" and the "where."
Escort everyone's favorite She-Male over here nice and peaceful-like. Let's not have another incident like at the laundromat.  I'll never forget the look on that poor woman's face.
Make a hole, Billy-Boy.
What are you, Henry friggin' Kissinger all the sudden?
Look, Kittle... pull over and let me out.  I'll be fine... okay?  How 'bout that... ?  Oh, Lord almighty, listen to me... I don't want to die!!  Lemme out of this coffin!!
The booze.
Name one.
You don't smoke.
Wha... ?
I can't believe we're stealing.
No, we're stealing.
Who said it wa's me, hub?  Anyway... he fell off a ladder.  It wasn't really my fault.
Don't talk like that.  There's plenty of women around for jerks like you.
Nope.
Where have you been?
He went to pick up lunch.
You bust some small-time pimps, whores and dime-bag junkies, like the world's a better place because you're in it.  And for what, Kittle... two hundred and fifty dollars a week? Tell me, how does anyone get so self-rightious when they can barely afford to pay their rent?
You... SUCK!  You almost got us all killed!
Can't be worse than you.
I can't believe I'm hearing this,
Just got here.
How'd we do?
Archibald Dobbs; Certified Public Accountant.  But, that's all we got.
We're screwed.
You John-Wilkes-Booth-ed him.
They're... around.
We saw it. All craft prepare to retreat.
There's still good in him.
You have done well, Lord Vader. And now I sense you wish to continue your search for young Skywalker.
As you wish.
I have felt him, my Master.
Han!
Leia!
The main entrance to the control bunker's on the far side of that landing platform. This isn't gonna be easy.
Look. I want you to take her. I mean it. Take her. You need all the help you can get. She's the fastest ship in the fleet.
Proper?!
He's my father.
No! Luke, run away, far away. If he can feel your presence, then leave this place. I wish I could go with you.
Do you have any tattoos Brad.
Janet.
Yes Brad.
Oh Janet
Oh dear!  But then where did the motorcyclists come from?
Let's wait awhile Janet.  We don't want to interfere with their celebrations.
This isn't the Junior Chamber of Commerce Brad.
Oh, I hope so my darling.  But let me switch on the light.
Janet!  Oh!  Yes it's alright.  Janet. Everything's going to be alright.
So baby don't cry like there's no tomorrow After the night there's a brand new day. And there'll be no pain And no more sorrow. So wash your face And phone my place It'll be O.K.
Dr Scott I'm sorry about your nephew.
From Transexual Transylvania.
That ain't no crime
The Master is not yet married.  Nor do I think he ever will be.  We are simply his servants.
Who's Eddie?
Our noble mission is almost completed my most beautiful sister, soon we will return to the moon-drenched shores of our "androgenous" planet.

Listen, I gotta problem. This girl ain't feelin' well, y'know -- The doctor says she should exercise, y'know once in awhile an' ice skatin' is the best thing --
This a con?
Am I seeing right? Creed is approaching the ring in a boat. Is he supposed to be George Washington? Obviously so.

I know the juice is climbin' -- I been workin' six months just to pay the damn interest.
Next Wednesday I grab a grand from Snyder. An' Thursday two yards from Cappoli, okay?
Yeah.

Maroon, right?
Men?  They look more like weasles to me.
So you wouldn't have any idea where he might be?
They?
A freeway, Mr. Valiant, is eight lanes of asphalt running uninterrupted from L.A. to Pasadena.  Pasadena to Hollywood.  Hollywood to Santa Monica. Someday everyone will be in cars driving happily, non-stop from one end of the L.A. Basin to another.
Earl... it's me, Valiant.
Not much.  It's hard to talk.
Lady, I guess I had you pegged wrong.
I Just thought I'd drop by and show you a photograph.
Have you got the will?
Meet me at my studio at nine o'clock. If you've got the will maybe we can stop this thing.
No, I don't.
You tricked me, damn you!
Don't worry, Eddie, no one knows I'm here.
Are you always this funny, or only on days when you're wanted for murder?
How do you know that?
An arsonist and a kidnapper.  He just got outta prison.
But, Eddie, you know what happens when...
Oh, Eddie, that was quick thinkin'. Nothin' like usin' the old noggin, the noodle, the grey matter...
Wrong number?
No better?
Then I defy you, stars! JULIET! JULIET! I will hence tonight.
Have patience!
Live and be prosperous; and farewell good fellow.
Any man that can write may answer a letter.
More than prince of cats. He is the courageous captain of compliments. He fights as you sing prick- song, keeps time, distance, and proportion; he rests his minim rest, one, two, and the third in your bosom: the very butcher of a silk button, a duellist, a duellist; a gentleman of the very first house, of the first and second cause: the immortal passado! punto reverso! the hai!
Good-morrow, cousin.
Good heart, at what?
Then she hath sworn that she will still live chaste?
I pay thy poverty, and not thy will.
Be not so long to speak I long to die.
I do spy a kind of hope, Which craves as desperate and execution as that is desperate which we would prevent. If, rather than to marry Paris, Thou hast the strength of will to slay thyself, Then it is likely thou wilt undertake a thing like death, to chide away this shame. No warmth, no breath shall testify thou livest . Each part, deprived of supple government, shall stiff and stark and cold appear, like death. Now when the bridegroom in the morning comes to rouse thee from thy bed, there art thou dead. Thou shalt be borne to that same ancient vault where all he kindred to the Capulet lie. In the meantime, against thou shalt awake, shall Romeo by my letters know our drift, and hither shall he come. And that very night shall Romeo bear thee hence to Mantua. Take thou this vial, being then in bed, and this distilling liquor drink thou off. I'll send my letters to thy lord post haste to Mantua.
How well my comfort is revived by this.
As the custom is, in all her best array, bear her to church.
Where is my Lady's lord?
Thou hast a careful father, child: One who, to put thee from thy heaviness, hath sorted out a sudden day of joy that thou expects nor I looked not for.
No, madam. We have culled such necessaries as our behoveful for our state tomorrow. so please you, let me now be left alone, and let the nurse this night sit up with you. for I am sure you have your hands full in all this so sudden business.
O honey nurse, what news? Nurse?
Well, you have made a simple choice; you know not how to choose a man: Romeo! no, not he; though his face be better than any man's, yet his leg excels all men's; and for a hand, and a foot, and a body,
The exchange of thy love's faithful vow for mine.
By the hour of nine.
It is, It is! Hie hence, be gone, away.  O, now be gone. More light and light it grows.
Romeo. What's here? Poison. Drunk all, and left no friendly drop to help me after. I will kiss thy lips. Happily some poison yet doth hang on them. Thy lips are warm.
A man, young lady! Lady, such a man As all the world- -why, he's a man of wax.
The slip, son, the slip; can you not conceive?
Pink for flower.
'Twill serve. Ask for me tomorrow and you shall find me a grave man. A plague o' both your houses. They have made worms meat of me. A plague on both your Houses! Why the devil did you come between us? I was hurt under your arm.
A Plague o' both your houses.
Finding this package is a thing easier said than done.  We don't even know what it is.  What did we steal?
From Interpol?
Now, what did we steal?
Don't even think that I'm buying that.
That fucking figures...
Perhaps we could both go at the same time...
And more importantly --
So what do we do?
What are you doing?
I need you, Swede, I can't do this without you!
How did you know?
American.
Something important?  A thing that cannot wait?
Is that right?
I'm just worried about your health, Larry.  You could stand to shed a few pounds.
Is that right?
He says this is their block.
A cigarette?  As in one?  One cigarette a week, who smokes like that?
Watch that one, he's an ex-spook for sure, maybe Stasi, maybe KGB.  He's smart, Gregor is.
So is the woman.
What's going on?
I just wanted to see something.
A lot of people died.
I've seen a lot of people die before.
You're with Interpol -- you're a cop.
This doesn't involve you, don't you understand?  I can't even guarantee you any money out of all this.
You don't have to do this.
You know him?
Right now?
Gimme a goddamn cigarette!!!!
I'm not here very much.
Why?  You've got more force of will than anyone I've ever seen.  You handle a gun like it's a part of you, you perform surgery on yourself without anesthesia...  And most amazing of all, you quit smoking, just like that.
And when you finish?  What then?  This package, whatever it is, do you give it to the CIA?  Do you really think they deserve it?
Finish the job...
You son-of-a-bitch...
"Your field dressing saved his life." That's three I owe you.
Cause the Russian production company would be easier to find.
I was wondering if you had any movies that were particularly new.
Don't spend it all in one place.
No.  We can't.
I told Trudy we were coming down this way, that's why!
It's going to go bigger than that. Could you stare someone straight in the face and lie about it?
What makes you so sure?
What are you gonna do?
We're dead.  We're dead, We are dead...  What are we going to do?!
I don't know...
Are you nuts?  They'll fry us for sure.  There's no way we're doin' that, you understand?  No way.
No.
Well what are we supposed to do?
We'll take the money and disappear! We can do it, spend it on the move. Even if all of it's marked, there's ways around it.
No.  It stops now.  It stops here.
You're the one who's nuts! There's no one left to touch us, Booth.  We're home free!  We just plant a little of the money on Dwayne, and it's all ours.
Listen Earl.  I covered for you. For both of you.  I put my ass on the line to save yours, so don't pull a hostile tone with me!
Well, I don't know...
Ok...I'll wait.  For now. But I'm going to need a little advance, to oil the wheels, so to speak.
You don't expect us to believe that do you?
Don't have much choice, Jesse. You saw to that!
Let's not get into this again. I know him.  If you said something, he'd take it out on me.
Dammit, I'm so sick of this.
How are we going to do all this?
I don't know.  My friends...
Do you wanna tell me what that was all about?
What is this?  Don't be stupid man...
Why?
What do you think about all this?
OK...this is good.  Our first solid lead.
Lingerie...
Have I seen her?
She's not his type.
Well, we got the DEA coming down here again, I don't know, sounds to me like they got some more questions they want to ask us.
I  have complete faith in you. But don't you go speeding.
What's this?
Whatever...
No, Dwayne, you go ahead and relax, have a six pack and fall asleep in front of the TV, and come upstairs and pass out.  And do it all over again tomorrow!
Well you're not getting, either.
What the hell are you doing, you crazy some bitches --
Are you hungry?
There was this raffle going on at the station, some charity or church was running it, I forget, so I figure what the hell put in my five bucks...
This whole place?
Ah, hell I'll get one soon enough.  Besides, I want you to have it.
No, I just assumed...
Hear you got your ass kicked in Hong Kong, James.
Jail!?  James, you better back off. Badge or no badge, I'll kick your ass.
I know you, Detective Carter, right? You're Lee's American friend.  Enjoying your visit?
Any girl?  Okay.  Let's start with that one.
You're right, you're a smart guy.  Most counterfeiters only get ten cents on the dollar.  But this is an even swap.  Pure genius.
I warned you about playing that shit when I'm in the car.
That's what I'm talking about.  A real Hong Kong night club.  You want an Altoid?
Carter, get off that stage!
What'd I say?
Over there -- that's Ricky Tan.
It's my job!
You would never understand my life. You're not Chinese.
I'm okay, you go.
Five years ago, my father was Chief Inspector working a big international smuggling case.
IT IS CRAZY!
Almost, but you've got to say "Rich White Man" all run together like it's one word.
Just tell me where I can find this Steven Reign.
Hey, I didn't mean to call you pathetic.
My fiancee left me over the summer -- a month before our wedding.
Hot?  I'm freezing my ass off.
I am not third world ugly.  Women like me, they think I'm cute.  Like Snoopy.
What's the first thing I told you -- never trust nobody.  How could you fall for that shit?  I knew she was dirty.
She saved our lives.
I'm not used to having a partner.
See you in the next world.
I think we should stop talking.
You're kidding.  No sex?  Nothing?  No mu-shu?
No mu-shu.
Once in a while, steamed dumplings.  But only when she was drunk.
Hello, Benjamin.
What is Mac out?
Couple?  No, you got it wrong, there's no couple here.  Just two single police officers working a very dangerous case.
Dancing?
The Plaza Hotel?
You move well.
Just trying to make it look real.
The Secret Service almost busted Reign at his casino in Macao, but the place burned down before we could move in.
I didn't know which side you were on.
Despite what people suspect...what you suspect --
I need your help, Master.  I'm seeking a man who used to train with you.  He's become a killer - the worst kind of animal.
Two Americans have been killed on United States Government property -- this is our investigation.
Tell me about it.
He was just doing his job.
You talk very fast.
Beach Boy.
You speak English!
A little.
-- what the hell is that?
Where were we?
Witnesses.
You're a regular god damn acrobat, aren't you?  Bet you feel real good makin' me look like an asshole.
I also did not come because I think I would not fit in America.
Not yee-aw, Ya'll.  And it's gotta be angry.  Like you're pissed off.
You drop my gun and you lose my i.d.?
What are you doing here?
Well...listen, if you need any help, you know, back up, call me, OK?
Wait a minute. I'm not riding in that.
What?! This is a class ride, Johnson.
You OK?
How much they want?
Yo, Johnson...
Oh yeah.  The caller was a man. Confident.  Had an accent.  My guess, Asian.  Anything else I can do for the FBI, sir?
Okay, let me start from the top.  A few days ago I was on this munitions dealer named Lafontaine. Now, after the shit blew up last night...
What's this little green wire coming out one side of the package?
She's fine.
Come on. Let's get you some dry clothes.
Bob's in a hurry.
I left four messages.  You don't return my calls.
What?
Lesson number two.  Never work for your former spouse.
I already made an appointment for later today.
Look, he's in pretty good shape.
Ellie asked me to come down to offer moral support.
It wouldn't be a bad way to get you back into writing feature pieces again.
Yes, well, my theory was that she may be running because she gets attention... Negative attention is attention. Like when women whack you on the street because of your column, that's negative attention.
This is about her negative attention, not mine.  Did you get the reimbursement for the dress yet?
She's a cacophony of contradictions.
This game is pretty important to him. He made all-stars in high school, you know.
They made me put my hat back on.
Well, wedding cake freezes.  This we know.
Like her mother.
Dad's fishing trip, Grandma's knee operation, Grandma's birthday...
Weird dreams?  You're going to tell me about them?
I'm not here to make you feel bad.  I'm here for vindication.  In my heart...
Yes.  Conviction.  Conviction that I'm onto the truth.  You're going to do the same thing to "poor bastard number four" that you did to the last three.  You're going to run again.  And I'm not leaving until you do.
You're going to be very disappointed.
You've seen the post-its.  I've already got more juicy material than I need. Why should I pay you dollar one?
No, I'm not afraid.  Just... Maybe someday.
No.
Your filter's clogged.  This takes unleaded.
Yes.
Or the sexual habits of locusts?
And where you ever really going to run the leper colony in Molokai?
Lost!
No, that's called not having a mind of your own.  What are you doing, Maggie? You really want to let that man drag you up Annapuma on your honeymoon?  You don't want to climb Annapuma.
Well, you do have the dress.
And the church.
I think you're right.  Is there anything I can do to make it up to you?
Something that brings warmth to my heart.  Duckbill platypus.
Grandma!
No, no.  I saw eight geese flying in a "V".
Maggie, it's just a joke...
You take the microwave?
I hate boats.
I hope I don't have to pay for that piece of information.
Harold, who ran away with his secretary but came back --
I was thinking, I have to go up to Boston for the AAP convention and then visit Winston-Hughes about switching over our computers.  Why don't we meet in New York for Valentine's Day weekend?
What is it?
What?
Right.
I know.
Thank you.  I love you.
You know that dream where you're walking down the street naked and everyone is looking at you?
I'm going to run back to Walter's arms, if he's still have me.
We're going to the Rainbow Room and the symphony tomorrow night.
So you want a financial, is he a deadbeat, we can do a D&B --
No, no, no, it's more like, who is he, does he have a sense of humor, is he nice -- no forget nice, I've got nice --
I know.
Oh God, it's major.  He's kissing her on the lips.  I have to stop this.
I think I'm going crazy, Tom. I really do.  Are you happily married?
It rains nine months of the year in Seattle.
I notice these things are back in fashion.  Oh, honey.  He's a lovely man, Annie.
You touch her for the first time, and suddenly... you're home.  It's almost like...
Which means --
The point is, take the client out to dinner and ask her to marry you and then maybe we won't have to redo the kitchen cabinets.
I'm not selling anything.  Your son called and asked for advice on how to find you a new wife.
How about rapacious and love- starved?
Hey, my plate is full.
And that's what I'm trying to tell you.  What women are looking over, okay? Pecs and a cute butt.
You think so?
Yeah.  What's that?
Do you know how much it costs to go to New York?
Do you want an aisle or a window seat?
Dad --
I can hear you walking around sometimes.  At first I thought it was a robber.  Go ahead, tell her, Dad.
P.  Dad?
How did they get our phone number?
If you get a new wife, I guess you'll have sex with her, huh?
What do you think?
You're worried we're going to be all right.  We're going to be all right.  I remember sometimes you'd have nightmares as a baby.  Your mom would hold you and rock you and sing you a song.
Jonah, I'm leaving --
She doesn't want us to go to Baltimore.  She wants to meet us in New York City on Valentine's Day.  On top of the Empire State Building.
I figure we could go to New York, catch the Knicks, and since we'd be there anyway, obviously we'd go to the Empire State Building --
Don't ever do that again.
This is not a joke.  Thank God Victoria doesn't know.  It would really have hurt her feelings.
The reason I know this and you don't is that I'm younger and purer so I'm more in touch with cosmic forces.
Thank you, Jonah.  But the point is, I am not asking permission.
Did not.
No.
If I didn't go.
What about it?
Sure.  I'd really like that. Thank you so much.
You're kidding --
Would you follow <U>her</U> through an airport?
You look good.
I know her pretty well.  Maybe I could call her --
Is he there?
He's ten.
I read an article about this ...
I've tried everything but shootin' 'em down.
What do you mean -- sex equality?
Now wait a minute. Super's the one made the rule. He ain't gonna give you no helper.
I see. The men. You'll strike, maybe, for your demands -- but what the wives want, that comes later, always later.
She's the organizer's, wife. She's got to be there.
You all right?
Tell me.
Whose funeral? We're doing all right. There hasn't been a scab near the picket line for three days.
Charley's my friend. I need friends.  Why are you afraid to have me as your friend?
We can't think of them just as housewives -- but as allies. And we've got to treat them as such.
Look who's talking! The Great White Father, and World's Champion of Women's Rights.
You mean Delaware?
The what!
The Junior Shop Stewards. There's lots of ways we can help.
You got a bathroom I can use before we hit the road?
What is it?
Ride 'em cowboy)
Everything go?
Yeah.
Look...I'd like to help you out ... but I really don't want to get involved.
Oh God.
Leave me out of this.
This man sounds like a real catch.
Oh, he's a keeper all right.
Go ahead.
Then leave.
You get off on abuse or something?
Then make sure he gets put away for longer.
And you admire that?
Is that how you play?
So you're just attracted to me, is that it?
What is wrong with you?
Why not?
They would have killed you too.
I knew that if these were the guys I was looking for, I'd have to set up a deal so sweet, they wouldn't be able to walk away from it.
Jimmy.  Everyone calls me Jimmy the Finn.
Finland is a country.
Sorry.
Why do they call him Pooh-Bear?
You want a hit?
Can I ask you something?
You don't trust me?
Yeah, I uh, have a buyer who's looking for about a quarter's worth.
I want to tell you about the last guy who tried to jam me up on a deal.
You go, boy.
You got a name?
God damn, Flynne, you are one observant tweaker.
Garcetti thinks I'm a pile of shit.
You think this is funny motherfucker?
For that old possession charge? Gimme a break.
To who?
Jimmy?
Who'd have thought it?  Danny "Chickenshit" Flynne trying to go large right under our noses.
Several possession charges, but nothing major.
Again, I thank you.
Just make sure you hit the floor when we come in. It could get ugly in there.
Don't worry about it.
Yes, sir.
I'm sending Simpson to take over for you, the division is going to Caen, you're not coming with us, I have something else for you.
In West Fork?
Thirty-ought-six, Norton long-barrel with dual-groove, parallel rifling, elevated three-glass scope and a single-throw hammer.
Reiben, how many time I got to tell you, I'm from Tennessee.
Shut up, will you?
Y'all come back.
Reiben, are you makin' fun 'a the way I talk?
Well, I'll be goddamned, I knew it.
Me?  I'm walking with my hound, Lucy, it's about an hour 'fore sunrise and we're out huntin' coon.  I got me a flask of pure Kentucky mash whiskey...
Sir, I understand what you're doin', but I respectfully request permission to grieve in my own manner.
No white-walls, sir, there's a war on.  NOT THERE, YOU GODDAMNED IDIOT, OVER THERE!  I can't help you, sir.
A paratrooper named Ryan.  He's going home, if he's alive.
Don't need it, I'm a cat, I've got five lives.
I'd like to stay, too, Captain.
Captain, what about our deal?
CAPTAIN, IF YOUR MOTHER SAW YOU DO THAT, SHE'D BE VERY UPSET!
I wish.  You and I are taking a squad up to Ramelle on a public relations mission.
You get a translator, Captain?
PUSH!
Maybe.
Nope.
You think they'll be alright?
Nope.
You're kidding yourself.
HOLD YOUR FIRE!
You alright?
Vecchio.
Bits and pieces.
Oh, yeah?
Reiben, I don't know what I'd do without you.  Sarge, keep Ryan close to you and alive.
Strides through the chaos, avoiding the passing vehicles.  He sees his men and walks toward them.  Reiben hurries up to Miller, pleading.
No, I'm not, Kaback is, honest.  Or what about Faulkner?  Or that little guy with the glasses?
Sure, what do you want to know?
I'd much rather die in Caen than Ramelle, sir.  It's a personal thing.
Well, maybe not the Captain, but the rest of us have mothers.
Reiben, what's the matter with you? I don't gripe to you.  I'm a captain. There's a chain of command.  Griping goes one way, up, only up, never down.  You gripe to me, I gripe to my superior officers.  Up, get it? I don't gripe to you, I don't gripe in front of you.  How long you been in the army?
I thought you said we had an hour, sir?
Except for the last part, that one's not bad.
I HAVE NO FUCKING IDEA.  HERE WE COME.  Cover me.
I wonder if his cabin is still available?
Continues FIRING.  CUTTING DOWN the advancing Germans.
I'd like to go, sir.
And Sarge?
Fertilizer, Captain, I think we're in a cranberry bog.
Who cares?
So, where are you from?
On guard, glancing back.  Pissed off.
Goddamn it...Goddamn it...Goddamn it...
Demolition, right?
Well, take a look around the house.  Is everything nice, but not too nice?  Are there lots of, uh, rugs, pieces of art, stereo equipment, uh, furniture, a lot of things bought with cash?  Does he give a lot of gifts?  Do the major items in your house cover around the nine thousand-dollar range?
This evening is over.
The, uh, Cynthia Branson estate was worth how much?  Because her family...
That's right.
No, I'm not married.  It's for my daughter.
You're sure?
Yeah.
I'll be in my office.
But you never had a first date.
Lloyd, give it up.
Yes.
I wouldn't get my hopes up Lloyd.
Lloyd, it's us.
One hundred and twenty-five thousand and nine months.
You like it?
Oh yeah!
Alright, no more, I'm going to save it.
Are you kidding?  You're not kidding?  You're not kidding!
Lloyd was such a gentleman.  He was funny and nervous and strange, and I met people that I never would have met before, then I blew it.  I called him basic.  Can you believe I did that?
She's not the world's greatest flyer, let me tell you.  When she was eight years old, she...
Lloyd?
I swear to god.
Yes, I...
Alright, alright.  Go ahead.  When I'm old, give me someone like me, but go ahead.
You will?
Yes, we sat together at Bell's Square.
Well...
What are these?
He does this every year?
You're a great date.  I've never really gone out with someone as basic as you.
Basic.  Hmmm.
You think so?
I usually have a break after the dinner service, if you want to stop by.
I know you think my job is strange.  You don't like old people, do you?
You have to meet Bess.
Be friends?
Yeah, just keep going first, keep going around.  Get the feel of it, feel the clutch, when you put it in a little?
If you'll just maybe ease it into second.
Little more gas.  Ease it up.  Hold on- minor setback.  Now you feel confident, right?
This is so noble.
It was wonderful.
You need to study?
Okay, what did we just decide?
No, no.
Don't be mean, this is hard for me too.
What do you want?
Okay.
No.  You just described every great success story.  Alright, it's alright.
YEAH!
He's back.  Hey my brother, can I borrow a copy of your 'Hey Soul Classics'?
Sorry, Diane isn't here at the moment.
The truck?
Hello Lloyd.
That's one of the things I wanted to talk to you about sir.
She's very successful.
I know
So what's up?
Mike Cameron, how you doing?
Yeah, but how come it worked?  I mean like, what are you?
It's gotta stay purple.  All night.  Hey Lloyd, how ya doin'?
We finally graduated, big dude guy!
You must chill!  You must chill!  I have hidden your keys. CHILL!
What's your name?
Should I stay?
In Breslau.
He looks great, though, doesn't he? I have to know - where do you get a suit like that?  what is that, silk?  It's great.
It's bad business.
He's important to my business.
Look -
I just told you.
What's that?
You asked for shoe polish.
What's wrong with it?
You think I don't know what you're doing? You're so quiet all the time?  I know.
It's got nothing to do with reality, Oskar, I know it and you know it, it's a matter of national priority to these guys.  It's got a ritual significance to them, Jews shoveling snow.
A one-armed machinist, Oskar?
The killer was trying to get to her. That sorority girl was a distraction.
How's the name search going?
You're sure about this two person thing?
No, they broke up again. Bailey won't stop drinking and Sarah can't take it anymore.
Kill, kill, kill, kill, hah, hah, hah, hah...
Oh, I'm sorry. My bad.  I thought you were someone else.
Why aren't you there?
I'm inquisitive.
Hello? Ted?
Cotton.
You wrote me a letter. Very cordial. Very appropriate.
Did it?
It helped me realize one thing.
Finish what my son started.
Not one bit.
Where have you been'? You missed my shining moment. I won the macaroni sundae binge.
Lemme take you home.
I don't really know what happened in Woodsboro, Sid. But I know you don't trust me.
He seemed harmless.
He hates Oliver Stone.
We have our own website now. We dedicated a whole page to you.
Of course not. Who wants to? Whats the point if we dont get caught? Wheres the glamour in that?
A twist ending if you will.
And an explanation is, of course, out of the question.
Page 41. "Deputy Dewey oozed with inexperience."
I think you're all an act.
Maybe they never got here. He could have taken her anywhere.
I'm sorry.
It seems to be causing a stir. What's with the toilet paper?
Sid, I'll come with you.
Time to change numbers again?
The young girl runs by a window. She looks in. A GHOST MASKED KILLER stares back. The Figure CRASHES through the window attacking her. She fights him off, getting away, running...
Popcorn flies as Maureen falls forward, into the aisle, clutching her bloody stomach. She's speechless, unable to SCREAM. She holds her bloody hand out for all to see, begging for help. She stumbles down the aisle. Someone YELLS "Sit down." Maureen turns to several PEOPLE who begin to react. She turns behind her to see the Ghost Face coming at her again...knife raised.
Hello?
You ass.
I'm sorry, Sid, please. I never should have gone along with Gale. I know I'm stupid. I wish I had some good reason to give you but I'm just stupid. Please, Sid, don't be mad at me.
Well, yeah...she gave me a job. Freelance. It got me outta Woodsboro. I'm sorry about Cotton and yesterday. It was a bad idea. I knew it was a bad idea but it seemed like a quasi harmless bad idea. Ah, shit, Sid, I'm fucked up. Sidney looks at him Long and hard, a smile slowly appearing.
I guess Gale's going to be pissed she missed her exclusive.
I think you got the wrong number, buddy.
You seem to be familiar with the STAB movies. Here's how we play. I ask you a question. You get it right, your girlfriend lives. You answer wrong, she dies.
I swear to God if you lay a finger on her I'll fucking kill you!
It's CICI! Cici's the name of the character she plays in the movie!
What?! But I did everything you said to do!
Alright I'm here. What the fuck do you want from me?
Shit. Sarah Darling.  I interviewed her too. God, it's happening again isn't it Detective?
Four? There are five.
Boys, boys, why don't we compare our gun calibers later?  The issue is Maureen Prescott!
Can't arrest ghosts.  But the best way to stop being haunted is to be with people.  You're here, you're not hiding, you've done the right thing, Miss Prescott.
Sidney, do you have any idea how he could've gotten your number?
What?
Dewey my God I thought you were dead.
You mean OUR past as in Me and Sid. This has nothing to do with you Gale.
You said you'd never leave Woodsboro, 'The only place that's real!'  But now you're here. Not with me.  Dewey, I took care of you.  I waited until you were well.  I couldn't stay there, I mean, it's like dog years, one year in Woodsboro is like seven everywhere else.
You used to say that was our strength.
Off the record.
Neither are you, Magnum P.I.
Do you want us to come with you?
Sidney, what happened?
Dewey, what the hell is she rambling about now? What's wrong Jen, see yourself on one of those USA NETWORK winners you did and realize how badly you suck at acting?
God damn it you two! Run! Hurry! He's dead!
None.
You know in the movies, I play you as being much smarter.
Basements creep me out.
It was in the 70's, everything was different. I was well known for my parties, Rina knew what they were. It was for girls like her to meet men, men who could get them parts, if they made the right impression.  Nothing happened to her that she didn't invite, in one way or another, no matter what she said afterwards.
Tom Prinze, tanked as usual. That's a shocker.
I know! He killed Kincaid!
Wait a second Sid. Don't you go jumping the gun. You haven't seen the best part.  With the aides of the computer revolution of y2kI've been able to steal your voice.  Ain't it cool? Listen to what the police are gonna find next to your lifeless, mutilated body.
Page 22..  Ring ring.  Hello?
Hello.
I'm hanging up right now.
It's Sarah.
If you lay a hand on him I'll fucking kill you!
Don't do it!  If you do one thing to attract attention, one thing, I'll kill them both. Now, do you have somewhere we can be alone?
Yes.
How'd you do?
It's an easy game. We ask you a question. If you get it wrong -- you die.
My dad's in the other room.
Close call.
I know. He called again last night at Tatum's house.
Sure it does. It's like Jodie Foster in SILENCE OF THE LAMBS when she kept having flashbacks of her dead father.
Who did you call?
Stop it!
Hello.
Hello.
You tell me your name, I'll tell you mine.
You're making popcorn?
Do you like scary movies?
Uh... NIGHTMARE ON ELM STREET.
Freddy -- that's right. I liked that movie. It was scary.
That's not what you said.
Nah, I don't think so...
I'm two seconds from calling the police.
Sure...
How do you know his name?
It was Jason. I saw that goddamned movie twenty times. It was Jason.
...leave me alone... please...
I know. We're checking every cellular account in the county. Any calls made to you or Casey Becker are being cross-referenced. It's gonna take time but we'll find him.
How is she?
What? What?
When did that ever stop you? You can't sit on this. This is huge.
About thirty seconds.
It's okay, Tatum. She's just doing her job. Right, GALE?
How's the book?
What is your problem? You got what you wanted. Cotton Weary is in jail. They're gonna gas him. A book is not gonna change that.
I think you falsely identified him. Yes.
Has his story changed?
And why is that?
That is so unoriginal. You disappoint me, Randy.
Maybe that's because I'm not Randy.
So where are you?
Stu was with me last night.
Don't come any closer.
And are the police aware you dated the victim?
Besides --  "Takes a man to do something like that."
Why would he want to kill his own girlfriend?
He came to make up.
His movie nut mind has snapped, Sid. He's gone psycho.
Tell your mom I said thanks.
I'm not worried.
It's okay. She was supposed to pick me up.
Just like old times, ain't it?
Do you really think Billy did it?
You're right. I'm cracking up. Ignore me.
Hey, Sid. Just think if they make a movie about you. Who's gonna play you?
Billy's right. Whenever he touches me, I just can't relax.
But he's been so patient with me, Tatum. You know, with all the sex stuff. How many guys would put up with a girlfriend who's sexually anorexic?
Grant Goodeve -- the oldest brother on EIGHT IS ENOUGH. Remember that show? He was the one who lived off alone. He would come around every now and then with his guitar and sing "Eight is enough to fill our lives with love..." He had all these brain dead sisters and that idiot brother from CHARLES IN CHARGE. God, I was in love with Grant, he was so hot. The show came on every day after school right during my puberty years. Grant Goodeve was very instrumental in my maturing as a woman.
Because there's no way a girl could have killed them.
Give it to me.
How is it working for a scumbag like this? You proud of yourself?
What do you think?
It's none of my business anymore.
How you feeling?
Spit it out.
Murderers like you?
You just met me.
It's my wife.
Well?
I read.  Remember reading?
All day Saturday, and all day Sunday.  The murderer would want Gould to take his time.  To have to sit there and decide. Where do you make the first cut?  There's a gun in your face... but, what part of your body is expendable?
Seven Terraces of Purgation.
Attrition.  When you regret your sins, but not because you love God.
This is the one thing.
Does this make it with you?
Why would we?
Listen to me.  He's all about playing games.
No.
Sooner or later his luck's goning to run out.
We don't know for sure...
And so what?
Just because the bastard has a library card, it doesn't make him Einstein.
Well, that was money well spent.
Modern Homicide Investigation.  In Cold Blood.  Of Human Bondage.  Human Bondage?
Think it through.  If we leave a hole like this, we'll never prosecute.  He'll walk.  We have to come up with some excuse for knocking on this door.
You know... there's not going to be a happy ending to this.  It's not possible anymore.
You do your job...
No.
If John Doe's head splits open and a U.F.O. flies out, I want you to have expected it.
Slut.
I'm sorry about this, Mrs. Gould.  I really am.
I need you to look at each one carefully... very carefully.  Look for anything that seems strange or out of place.  Anything at all.
Let's get along...
If you're talkin' about that crazy murder charge...
This 'un come a long way 'fore he died.
No sir...pleasure.
You askin' as a Reverend or a Captain, Sam?
...as you have of findin' those girls alive by ridin' into 'em... I say we do it my way, Ethan...and that's an order!
I got to ask you and Martin to ride to the State Capitol with me, Ethan.
We can get within 500 yards...there's a hogback to the south.
Yes, sir...Troop's about ten miles back...The Colonel sent me looking for you...
I've come now...
Don't want no money, Ethan...jus' a place -- a roof over m' head...a little grub...a bunk to sleep in... an' a rockin' chair by the fire... my own rockin' chair by a fire...
Are you sure they didn't die of carbine shots fired by a bunch o' Yank bluebellies so scared they couldn't tell the difference between a Cheyenne and a Comanche?
What you want me to call you?
Name's Ethan...Now what's so mighty fishy about this trail?
Easy on that!
Say it. We're beat!
You can keep your will!  I ain't forgettin' you was all set to shoot her yourself...What kind o' man are you, anyway.
Well, we only got the one lead -- Scar...And where we begin to look, I don't know...
You ever see it before...like mebbe on a dress Debbie wore?
She's not a little girl any more.
Finish your breakfast...
It wasn't much of a letter...
Ellen, move aside...
I have a funny feeling.  Do you think we'll get over all that's happened?
During the Middle Ages people were executed at every corner.  What's your point?
You know what I have to do now, and believe me:  I don't enjoy doing this.
Ellen Straub.
We should leave the past alone.
Tenth floor.
Look at this.  The lock is totally demolished.
You did not like the speech?
Ohwhat have I done?
Well, I am to Deptford now, I leave my respects, Miss Rosaline.
A comedy. All but done, a pirate comedy, wonderful.
Black Sue, Fat Phoebe, Rosaline, Burbage's seamstress; Aphrodite, who does it behind the Dog and
Gentlemen! Thank you! You are welcome.
That's me.
Cut his nose off.
This time we take your boots off!
What have I done, Mr. Fennyman?
Mr. Fennyman, let me explain about the theatre business.  The natural condition is one of insurmountable obstacles on the road to imminent disaster. Believe me, to be close by the plague is a bagatelle in the ups and downs of owning a theatre.
Do you know it?
Who is she this time?!
Nobody. The author.
We are about to embark on a great voyage.
Another little problem.
Romeo and Ethel the Pirate's Daughter.  Yes, I know.
The daughter of his enemy.
"Out."
Two hours at prayer!
Well-monied is the same as well-born and well-married is more so. Lord Wessex was looking at you tonight.
Like Valentine and Silvia?
Oh, Nurse! He would give Thomas Kent the life of Viola De Lesseps's dreaming.
Speak out! I know who I am. Do you love stories of kings and queens? Feats of arms? Or is it courtly love?
Your Majesty
"Madam!"
You left it in my bed. Come to look for it again.
Are you to be my muse, ROSALINE?
I am, Master Shakespeare.
"What satisfaction can'st thou have tonight?"
Oh
There is time. It is still dark.
You lie in your meadow as you lied in my bed.
I love you, Will, beyond poetry.
"Wilt thou be gone? It is not yet near day> It was the nightingale and not the lark That pierced the fearful hollow of thine ear. Nightly she sings on yon pomegranate tree. Believe me, love, it was the nightingale."
I have hurt you and I am sorry for it.
An excellent beginning  Let him bea duke. And your heroine?
But fearful of her virtue, she comes to him dressed as a boy
Good bye, my love, a thousand times good bye.
My lady Viola.
It is not my riding day, my lord.
Bless me, I thought it was a horse.
Take off your hat.
Do you understand me?
Like a sickness and its cure together.
An insolent penny-a-page rogue, Marlowe, he said, Christopher Marlowe--has he been to the house?
What do you think?
I don't have time.
No.
Think about it.
I'm only asking you both to think about it.
You know what I'm talking about.
You know what. Who's going to do it.
We all are, David, we're all going to do it. Each of us, you, me and Juliet, will do his or her bit. Is that fair enough?
I don't hear this.
I don't know.
Nothing.
Looking for you? Yes.
It wasn't deep enough. I told you it wasn't deep enough, but you wouldn't listen.
It's very kind of you to offer, but --
Well?
What does it look like?
That's because he is. Does that upset you?
What?
Cameron?
When you get up in the morning, how do you decide what shade of black to wear?
And when did anyone last say to you these exact words: You are the sunshine of my life'?
Maybe you should go, Alex.You'll meet someone wonderful.
Aroused and inflamed.
In a moment he's going to tell he could have been someone --
The man we know and love.
A miserable, burnt-out, empty shell of a -- Alex pauses, looks at his drink, then at Juliet.
Know and love?
Maybe he didn't like us.
Hugo.
He's got a car?
I will ask you once more, what sort of car --
Alex, the key is in the keyhole on the other side.
I wonder how he did it?
But you're a doctor. You kill people every day.
Who was it?
It tastes different.
Leave him alone.
He can't stay up there.
What are you doing here?
Oh, good.
And if it sounds like I'm being killed, you'll phone the police, you'll tell them everything?
It's about me and David.
So, uh...
What about?
Two?
How strange. And how unsatisfactory to have misleading information. Only three people here. You're sure?
No, they were asleep. They didn't even wake up.
Yes. Why do you think you woke and they didn't?
Is this where no one stays?
You're sure of that.
I'm sorry.
Two hundred pounds?
Visitors? Some friends maybe? Someone you talked to?
So let's go.
Oh, don't be so coy, dear. You're going to Rio.
In this firm.
What guy?
Yeah, here, I mean, where else?
A priest who dies.
The telephone? It continues to ring.
It was some guy called Brian.
Air France. Glasgow. Direct, but then you're looking at the wrong end of nine hundred and twelve pounds. That's nine one two. It's up to you.
I don't know, I think...
I just thought you'd like to know --
-- what, who? Oh she's very nice, yes -- I mean normally ---
Yes and you don't have to be sarcastic about it, that's a beautiful thing he's doing -- some people do more than go to the beauty parlor and shop at Saks --
You're very rude... if you don't come back --
I don't want to place you in any position --
You're looking great, baby.
And I certainly wouldn't tell Lester.
But aren't you...
Like what?
Then it's not your problem.
How do you expect to get anything done if you allow yourself to get sidetracked? Particularly in your business... you deal with women every day...
I do her hair, yeah.
Are you gay?... baked apple?... they're cold but they're good.
Yeah.
Have you ever made it with a girl?
No kidding.
I am not like my mother!
Look, Norman, I'm not the shampoo girl.
I don't know. Probably not.
How long you had this?
Shut up, it's all right.  Do you want a drink?
No, thanks.
Not too much, don't cut too much.
If you screw me up for tonight, I'll kill you, I swear to God, I'll kill you.
Did I what?
It'll ruin everything.
Sit down.
-- oh yeah... what do you know about this guy?
Me?
-- Jesus --
No --
Well then what are you trying to do-
If you knew how many times I wanted to hear you say that...
So what? You don't love him, do you? Answer me.
I don't know... Jackie?
Don't leave me...
Wanda...
Oh yeah?
If I have to touch her again, I'll throw up!
-- White ladies?
Nothing, my sister's back from Vegas.
What?
When I was a little kid, I used to want to go to Europe but right now wherever I am I'm gonna be in Europe.
What!
They want me to go to Egypt for three weeks.
Hey, I'm, you know --
Okay, but how did it go at the bank?
George.
Honey, have they offered you the job?
They didn't offer you the job yet.
Where's your car?
What do you mean, what is it? It's some political bullshit.
How come you took your own car?
Well, did you get a job out of it at least?
Where did this come from?
So who else was there besides Jackie? Huh?... huh?
What difference does it make?
... honest. At least you're honest with me.
That's all you've got to say?
George, now cut this out.
Did you?
Yes, yes, I did.
She says you're a fabulous hairdresser.
But the important thing is you're successful at it.
But what?
Thank you.
But personal services are not the kind of thing I usually get into.
... she's very upset...
It's a difficult situation, and I want you to know I appreciate it. Tonight's going to be real tough for me --
This really ought to be layered...
Layered?
Now wait a minute...
What, do you think I planned it?
Just a whore, I go over there, have a few drinks and get my gun off. I'm through with her, she's nothing but a whore.
I... uh... I... uh... can't.


Yeah.
I told you I get 'scared up here, so if you're not coming right now...  I'm not kidding.
A soap?
A daytime soap opera.
I was too old.
My secretary saw you with that boy.
Steve?
Now listen, Jackie, I'm not jealous of anybody, I just can't afford to get caught... off base.
Why not?
Who are they?
Oh, honey, don't be totally naive.
I'm not. Maybe I am.
Well, what is it, honey?
We don't think marriage is important.
I would say so, yes.
-- Yesss?
Go ahead, Jill, you can say it.
I see. You mean he just sort of fucks you.
Getting your hair done...  Would you like to go to a party?
-- Jackie really shouldn't drink --
You're kidding.
-- his car. They have it blocked.
-- oh no, honey, I'll do that...
Do you have children?
Yes.
Yes?
You wouldn't ever hurt Mummy and me, would you?
Mr. Halloran, what is in Room 237?
Yeah.
Mom?
Yes?
Not right now, Daddy's asleep.
If Jack won't come with us, we'll just have to tell him that we are going by ourselves.  That's all there is to it.
Danny... what's the matter, hon?
Mommy!
Tony.
Oh I wouldn't think of it.
I'm afraid it's advocaat sir.  It tends to stain.
Won't keep you a moment, sir.
I fear that you will have to deal with this matter in the harshest possible way, Mr. Torrance.  I fear that is the only thing to do.
Thank you very much.  I'll do that.
I'm a Wendy.
I wouldn't know what to do with it if I did.
Bill, how do you do?
How are things going, Mr. Torrance?
Nothing that I can't handle though, Lloyd.  Thanks.
Sure is.
No.  It's the truth, really.  I swear it.  Danny told me.  He went up into one of the bedrooms, the door was open, and he saw this crazy woman in the bath-tub.  She tried to strangle him.
Somebody did that to him.
Yes.
Stop it!
Wendy give me the bat.
Stay... stay away!
Jack, stay away from me!
Give me the bat.
Very nice to meet you.
Let's see, where were we?  Yes.  I was about to explain that eh... our season here runs from oh May 15th to October 30th and then we close down completely until the following May.
...the winters can be fantastically cruel, and the basic idea is to...to cope with the very costly damage and depreciation which can occur.  And this consists mainly of running the boiler, heating different parts of the hotel on a daily rotating basis, repairing damage as it occurs and doing repairs, so that the elements can't get a foothold.
shut in together over long periods of time.
Right there.
Holy-jumped-up-baldheaded-Jesus-CHRIST!
You always take his side because he's a cripple! Well, it's not my fault that he's a cripple!
Are you all right, Marty?
What kind of noises?
Rats...
Mom-!
Yeah, Winesburg, Ohio, was never like that... but I got something that just might cheer you up.
It really goes fast. Thanks, Uncle Al.
I don't get you.
Do you really think that a man who took a rocket in the eye three nights ago could be out mowing his lawn? He'd either be in the hospital... or dead.
After Marty called me with his latest Thrilling Tale of Wonder, I did.  He's had no poison-pen complaints lodged at all.
The kid is eleven years old and already he sounds like a Jesuit. A French Jesuit.
Yeah.  We all got caught.  Shoplifting. Cuttin' school.  Cuttin' up some bitch with a blade.  So we gotta come here.  So we'll be good, in the future.  So we'll learn valuable lessons.  And I learned mine.  I will be incredibly good, I will never rip out nobody's nose-ring by accident ever again.  Can I go now?
What you say?
SING!
But I'm fearful!
So, hi there.  I'm... Sister Mary Clarence.  And you're... young Christians.  I guess I should assign you this passage.  What's good?  What were you talking about?
'Cause we love it so damn much.  And cause we gotta come here.  Probation.
Hey, Sisters.  Are you going in there?
What do you want?  This is a private area!  Get lost!
You ain't got nothin' I ain't seen.
You bastard!
Yes?
Babe, what happened here?  Look at you.
Good evening, Vincent.
Hold it.  Mary Patrick, you're a pretty cheerful person, aren't you?
It's true -- I know her.
Which convent?  It was, um, the Little Sisters... of the Moonlight.  In Vegas. Everybody used to come to Mass.  Frank. Dean.  Sammy.  Right at ringside.
Progressive convents.  Vanity.  It sounds awful.  It sounds just like this place.
Soprano or alto?
Sure.  Kind of... free-lance.
Free-lance?  Oh really?  You think I don't see?  You think I took vows yesterday?  I know what you're up to. You and Reverend Mother.
Very nice.  Sisters, have we learned our lesson?  I won't hold this little episode against anyone.  I'll try not to.
Wet behind the ears.
She's a pro.
You have to help me
Experience!  Right?
Initiation.  You understand.  Later on, we make her wear her underwear on her head.
Oh my Lord!
I don't know, some people just don't like nuns.  I wish I had a ruler.
I don't want to mess anyone up...
Wait, this isn't the way.  Who are you?
Don't you know it!
BUT THE LORD CAME TO ME
A convent?  They put me in a convent? What's the problem?  Wasn't there any more room in Hell?
I was expelled!  When I was fifteen?
What?
Fine.  Got it.  Look, the way I see it, I'm stuck here, right?  I mean, I'm here or I'm target practice.  So here's the deal -- I don't bug you, you don't bug me.  I'll catch up on some sleep, watch some tube, lay back and lay low.  So just get me a key and show me to my room, and do not disturb.  Capisce?
How about a robe?  One of those big terry cloth jobs, with like embroidery on the pocket.  "Guest of St. Katherine's"
No problem.
Sisters, for the rest of the day we shall declare a Vow of Silence.
A what?
Useless distractions.
Oh, I don't know... Satan?
This is a convent, not a clinic.  We offer moral guidance, not hardware.
You may stay.  But I shall restrict your activities to but a single task.
Through blasphemy?  You have corrupted the entire choir!
You sent for me?
Really.  Well, that makes two of us.
I have submitted my resignation to Bishop O'Hara.  Privately.  I have asked to be relocated as soon as possible.
But...
From Vince?  What a guy.  Doo-lang, doo- lang.
You'd lose.  You'd die.  All over the sidewalk.  And into the street.
All right!  I get the picture!  I'll do it!  I'll testify!
Nuns, Eddie.  There are nuns here. Everywhere.  It's crawling with 'em.
Everywhere but this little hole-in-the- wall convent.  Nobody knows you're here but me.  We're trying to get a quick court date.  A month, maybe two, tops. I'll spring you as soon as I can.
What'd she say?
I really can't talk about it now.  The place is packed.  SRO.  I've got a show to do.
Well..  thanks.  I've been thinking about you.. - sometimes.  I mean, there aren't a lot of guys around here.  I mean, sometimes I feel like... a nun.
I think they'd understand.
He's so damn cocky.  This is different.
It's a bluff, Vince.
It's done?
But, Vince, how do you know she didn't like, join up and become a nun when she was in that convent?
Well?
Right.
Joey?
But, boss -- she's still, you know, a nun.
She was real quiet and peaceful all the way back in the car.
I figured if you were gonna, then I wouldn't have to.
It should be here any minute.
Yes, Mary Patrick?
Mary Clarence!  Sister!
You mean -- they kidnapped her?
She said they were from her old convent.
Las Vegas -- she's here somewhere.
Absolutely not.  I am very sorry, but no.
But, Bishop, surely you realize -- this is a most dangerous neighborhood.
She's... she's a nun.
Who took the meat?
Certainly not.
Stains of blood.
All I know is three are slain, their heads found severed from their bodies...
Are you a deist?  Is that it?  A free thinker who does not believe in divinity.
They need guidance.
You are so upset now... and yet, you seemed in such good spirits last night.
I have everything... last testaments... birth certificates, death certificates... deeds.
Just a moment... if I may.  It is possible this man was murdered.
And now Jonathan Masbath.
Why would he flee this direction, with so much open ground to cross before he reached cover?
Listen to what you say....
I'm sure I don't know.
What is it?
Man or woman?
All I saw was their lantern.
Take me with you.  There's nothing left for me here.
Perhaps it is because your suitor's hands were recently very nearly wrapped around my throat.
He has proposed to me twice.
To call a person superstitious is to imply they fear magic, but not all magic is black.
You made this, and the drawings?
Why would you do such a thing?
I have misjudged you I think.  I did not imagine you were so cruel.
What are you on about?
You falter with your answer because you strive without putting the whole of your heart into it.  Can't you see? You'll bring dignity to the dead even if you have to chop them into little pieces to do it.
Allow me some time.  I have spent every hour in the company of others. I need to be alone.
What are you doing?
Why is it every grave I open holds a new mystery inside?
The skull is gone.
What would you have me believe?
Ichabod...
Quickly, close it.
Where?
There was not much blood, was there?
The Horseman.  Yes.
Can you help?
She has confessed.
There was these two old boys hung their peckers off of a bridge to piss, one old boy from California and one old boy from Arkansas. Old boy from California says, "Boy this water's cold." Old boy from Arkansas says "Yeah, and it's deep too."  Get it? That's a goodun.
Yeah, that's a goodun. I believe you did tell me that one before. I've heard that a bunch. Long time ago.
Just thought I'd check on Karl and see if everything's working out.
Did you decide, sir?
What you got in there, warshing?
How fer you going with them sacks full of warsh?
... on the third day I washed her. She wasn't very clean. I got all the right spots. She was the first one I ever kept for any length of time, you see I get bored easily, I have a short attention span. I can't say she enjoyed her stay, although the washcloth in her mouth held in place by good duct tape kept any complaints to a minimum. I don't really like people who talk a lot. I like to do the talking. I guess that's why I'm so fond of you. You're so easygoing, although I do sense a little tension in you sometimes. By the way, how was it out there? Did you have any fun? Make any new acquaintances? Tell me what it was like.
You know better than that. We're on duty. Catch me in that Camaro next week one night.
I ain't sayin' it's right. I'm just tellin' the truth. What was he in the nuthouse for?
Who could eat with him settin' there makin' that goddamn racket with his throat.
Well, it's on! We're gonna rock. Linda, call Vaughan. Tell him to get over here. I'd like him to be here. I owe him a good time.
Don't tell me what to do.
Well, honey, I don't guess I give a shit. I ain't here half the time anyway. If you want a retard livin' in the garage, I don't guess I care. I've got a good tool box and socket set out there I don't want stol'd. I guess I could take it home with me.
No sir.
What have you got to be nervous about? You're a damn kid. You ain't got any bills to pay or bidness to run or old lady to stay on your ass all the time.
I bet you like sittin' between two men in a dual wheel truck don't you?
How come you're carryin' them around with you.
Are you well?
Hey there. I thought I heard somebody on the porch. Wasn't your name Karl?
You don't need to know all of that. You're just a boy. You need to think about good thoughts while you're still a boy. They'll be plenty of time for the other.
I reckon if you want me to.  I got some of that potted meat and sodie crackers left over if you want some.
Yeah.
Yeah, I reckon they did. Hit like to tore me up when I read about that pore little cripple boy.
If you want me to.
Just 'cause I'm not rich don't mean I don't love her.
You ort not to pull on yourself that away.
So it died when it come out?
That makes me feel real sad. Couldn't you have done somethin', Karl? I would have. I wish I would of had him. He'd be here right now. Livin'.
Readin' on this book on how to work carpentry. I aim to learn how to build things out of wood one of these times. I've always been partial to wood buildin's and cabinets and whatnot. These drawin's they got here don't make no sense to me so far.  You seem like yore tails a'draggin' a might. You got somethin' wrong with ye?
I wadn't thinkin' about nothin' else just like you told me I'd do.
Can we play ever' Saturday?
Hey, Karl. How'd you know to come out here?
Karl, I ain't tryin' to say nothin' bad about you, but why don't you stop Doyle when he gets that away? You're older than him. You're strong, too. My daddy wouldn't let him do that to me and Mama.
Yeah, I guess so. I'm real tired, you know that. A kid my age shouldn't be tired of things.
Man. Thanks.  You know when you get a feelin' and you don't know why?
Reckon what kind of a feelin'?
Okay. I give you my word. Is ever'thing gonna be okay? Are you all right?
What are you doin' up again, Frank? You need to get a little sleep.
Did Vaughan go home?
Yeah, he has to go to work in a little while. I do too.
Huh?
Yeah, honey, someday everything's gonna be all right.
I know honey. Just remember what I said, we'll bide our time. You just steer clear of him as much as you can. Doyle's had a real hard life. It's just about run him crazy I think.
Yes, I guess you are.
You better go get your things.
Your daddy's still livin' down there from what you told me.  I guess he wouldn't help you any, would he? I wasn't thinking. You don't know anybody?
I never was no good with history.
Do they know about you?
That boy, he's my friend. He likes the way I talk and I like the way he talks.
I didn't aim to.
Yes ma'am.
Mustard's good on 'em to me.
Well, okay. I got you some.
Frank, he went off, too. He ain't gonna be in there when you get indoors.
Naw, I don't believe you have. I don't reckon I never been in here. This store didn't used to be here.
What brings you back?
I reckon Mr. Woolridge got me hired on to work for Bill Cox's outfit.
Yes sir.
I reckon I can stand to eat a little somethin' or 'nother at noontime tomorrow. Bill Cox generally gets me a box of french fried potaters. But I reckon he can lay off doin' it tomorrow.
I've heard it said that way.
What about you, Karl? Do you want to stay here?
I don't know what to tell you. I'm sorry. I made myself pretty clear I thought. He probably got busy and wasn't thinking. I know how that is. I used to teach shop and eighth grade science.
That's really strange. What does it mean?
Wherever he wants to. I think he's going back to Millsburg where he's from. It's just about twenty miles from here.
Also, Melinda, please don't tell anybody at the store that Albert was here tonight, okay.
Until she was twelve. She moved here in 'forty-nine.
It's just a summer job. Something to help pay the bills while I finish my dissertation.
American literature. What else?
Not an easy book.
Uh ... actually, it might be better if you read the story first. Call me when you're finished, okay?
Two tins of Schimmelpennincks. And throw in a lighter while you're at it.
You run out of Schimmelpennincks?
That's right. More than four thousand pictures of the same place. The corner of 3rd Street and Seventh Avenue at eight o'clock in the morning. Four thousand straight days in all kinds of weather.  That's why I can never take a vacation. I've got to be in my spot every morning. Every morning in the same spot at the same time.
It's my project. What you'd call my life's work.
I don't know, it just came to me. It's my corner, after all. It's just one little part of the world, but things happen there, too, just like everywhere else. It's a record of my little spot.
Fuckus my assus. They did some number on you.
You usually get two.
So. Are we ready?
I'm all ears.
Shit. If you can't share your secrets with your friends, what kind of friend are you?
At least I've stayed true to myself. Which is more than I can say about some people.
You didn't write to me for more than a year. What was I supposed to think?
And that's how Felicity came into the picture. During one of those two seconds.
Where to?
Are you calling me a liar? I'm telling you I'm broke. I don't even have insurance on my goddamned car.
For keeps.
Fuck this angel shit. Just take the dough, Ruby. But no bawling, okay? I can't stand people who blubber.
How long you been working for me, Auggie?
You don't take anything seriously, do you?
Enjoy it while you can, Vin. Pretty soon, they're going to legislate us out of business anyway.
Come around to the cigar store tomorrow morning at ten o'clock and we'll talk about it, okay? We'll see what we can work out.
No, it's five thousand dollars.
Huh?
Seventy-eight dollars. The girl who rolled these was probably wearing panties.
A good choice. You wouldn't want to celebrate the birth of your firstborn with a box of stinkers, would you? Remember to keep them in the refrigerator until you hand them out.
How the hell did you get into the building?
Thomas? Who's Thomas?
Rashid? Rashid! Is that what he told you his name was?
His parents? Is that what he told you? His parents?
I shouldn't have let him go.
Well, one thing I suppose, but I don't think it has anything to do with this.  A friend of mine called about two weeks ago and said she'd spotted Thomas's father working at some gas station outside of Peekskill.
And?
His father walked out on his mother a couple of months after he was born. Louisa was Henry's younger sister, and she and the baby moved in with us. Four or five years go by, and then one day Cyrus shows up out of the blue, tail between his legs, wanting to patch things up with Louisa. I thought Henry was going to tear Cyrus apart when he saw him walk through the door. They're both big men, those two, and if they ever started to tangle, you'd see some teeth jumping on the floor. I guarantee it ... So Cyrus persuaded Louisa to go out with him to talk things over in quiet. And the poor girl never came back.
Don't put words in my mouth. What I'm saying is she drove off in Cyrus's car and went to the Five-Spot Lounge with him for a drink. What I'm saying is that he imbibed too much in the way of alcohol and that when they finished their little talk three hours later and got back in the car, he was in no shape to drive. But he drove the car anyway, and before he could get her back to where she lived, the damn fool ran a red light and went straight into a truck. Louisa got thrown through the windshield and was killed. Cyrus lived, but he came out of it a cripple. His left arm was so mangled, the doctors had to cut it off. Small punishment for what he did, if you ask me.
I'm working on a sketch. That old garage of yours is so rundown, it's kind of interesting.
Five bucks! You mean you're going to charge me five bucks just to look at it?
Five bucks an hour. That's the going rate, isn't it?  It's a quarter past two now. My wife's picking me up at five-thirty, so that'll give you about three hours. If you can't finish today, you can do the rest tomorrow.
The name is Cyrus Cole.
Yeah, but he's my son. Nothing strange about that. He's my own flesh and blood. But here you got the same name as this man here, and you're not even the same color.
Well what?
Aren't you going to say anything?
You can do whatever you want with your own life. We're thinking of the baby, that's all. We want you to get yourself cleaned up for the baby. Before it's too late.
I'll tell you why they're not going anywhere.
Hey, Jimmy. You got the time?
I can't believe I did that ... Christ. I'm walking around in a fog ...
You must eat lunch pretty early. It's only eleven o'clock.
In Manhattan?
Of course. Where else?
That's where the what comes in.
The what?
I can take care of myself. Don't worry.
I listen on the radio. I can see the games just fine that way.  The world is in your head, remember?
Yeah, I can believe it.
Eight-thirty?
Three nights.
It sounds like our time is up, doesn't it?
Absolutely. The world is my oyster.  Whatever that means. 
I don't have much time. 
That's because we don't belong anywhere. You don't fit into your world, and I don't fit into mine. We're the outcasts of the universe.
Here we are.  Rembrandt's drawings. Edward Hopper. Van Gogh's letters.
Not exactly. I mean, there was more to it than I told you.
Yeah, I picked it up.
That's just it. I didn't think. I just did it.
You have one hell of a knack for getting into trouble, don't you?  So how much does it come to?
Yeah, well, you have to be nuts to do what you did. If you want my opinion, you should give this money back to the Creeper. Just give it back and tell him you're sorry.
It wasn't my fault.
If you don't tell me what happened, how do you expect me to know that? I need facts, not opinions.
I suppose so. He never told me about it.
You'll do it, all right. You fuck up, you've got to undo the damage. That's how it works, buster. If you don't do it, I'm going to throw you out of here. Do you understand me? If you don't pay Auggie what you owe him. I'm finished with you.
I'll take the iced coffee.  You only live once, right?
Don't know how long it's take to get a charge...
Seven acres.  I'm wonderin' what you'd pay for 'em.  Just curious, is all.
No, but as I say, the type is rare. Ten percent of Caucasian males.
So that makes what would have been $4500 into $7000, doesn't it?  If you sent the equity back, you had a profit of $2500.
My mom.  Would be the problem.
I can just feel my spirits soar.
Could you tell me what 'kendo' is?
Your line of work.  You must meet a lot of men play fast and loose with the truth.
<u>Were</u> you, sir?  Can you <u>prove</u> one word of all your fancy story?
My apologies.  Do you regret not telling the truth?
It's the way it happened, I know it is.
Now you believe there were <u>two</u> lanterns when defendant arrived. One in Carl's hand.  The second lashed to the mast.
He figures a perfectly good lantern could get banged around up there.  So he climbs up.  To cut it down.
Still and all.  Carl was a strong swimmer, he m...
White or black?
So every time you think about showing that jury strength.  Or honor or composure.  Or dignity.
Maybe the assailant straightened the cabin.  And forgot the cup.
You found three batteries, you say.  A D-6 and D-8 in the well. And a spare D-8 on the cabin floor. Correct?
But he had a spare D-6, you said. Right there.  Why not use that?
Two D-6's.  That's the kind his well was fitted for.
I believe so.
And her farmhouse...?
Which you inferred was replaced by the D-6, which must have been a spare.
The same.
I already said that, b...
But you are <u>certain</u> that he died by drowning.
So your husband said he's think it over.  Encouraged Mr. Miyamoto to believe he might sell to h...
The question is more about the <u>defendant's</u> attitu...
You know, Bienstock, there's something funny about those two new girls.
Upsy-daisy.
Okay. 
He even got Charlie's last toothpick - the one from the garage - and had it gold-plated.
Same faces - same instruments -  - and here's your Valentine's card.
We're not?
He's a shoo-in.  I got the word from Max the waiter - his brother-in-law is the electrician who wires the rabbit -
Greased Lightning!  Why do I listen to you? I ought to have my head examined!
It did?  Boy, did it ever!
Nellie told us about it.
But, Joe - three weeks in Florida!  We could borrow some clothes from the girls in the chorus -
You going to call the police?
Who are we kidding?  Look at that - look how she moves - it's like jello on springs - they must have some sort of a built-in motor. I tell you it's a whole different sex.
What are you afraid of?  Nobody's asking you to have a baby.  This is just to get out of town. The minute we hit Florida, we'll blow this set-up.
This way, Daphne.
Boy, would I like to borrow a cup of that Sugar.
All right, all right!  But how long can we keep this up?
Yes, Mr. Fielding - you'll pick her up after the show in your motorboat - goodbye - what's that you said?  Oh - zowie! I'll give her the message. 
What message?  What motorboat?
Don't give me the musketeers!  How'm I going to keep the guy ashore?
Jerry!  You can't be serious!
Jerry, you'd better lie down. You're not doing well.
We've been discussing that.  He wants to go to the Riviera - but I sort of lean toward Niagara Falls.
That's some nerve!
I tell you, Joe, they're on to us.  They're going to line us up against the wall and -  Eh-eh-eh-eh-eh - and then the police are going to find two dead dames, and they're going to take us to the ladies' morgue, and when they undress us - I tell you, Joe, I'm just going to die of shame.
Sugar?
That's when I was a saxophone player. Now I'm a millionaire.
Wait a minute - my bracelet.  What happened to my bracelet?
All right - so what do we do now?
Tell him you're going to elope with him.
Terribly sorry.
If there's anything I can do for you -
No.  It's nice and cozy.
So spill it.  Spills, thrills, laughs, games - this may even turn out to be a surprise party.
Uh-uh.  Not yet.
When?
See?  She doesn't have one either -  You don't?
Oh, I have some suntan lotion.
I mean, your shoulders - and your arms -
If I'd been watching my step, I never would have met him.  Wait till I tell Josephine.
We don't have to run.
We could dye our hair.
My last wife was an acrobatic dancer - you know, sort of a contortionist - she could smoke a cigarette while holding it between her toes - Zowie! - but Mama broke it up.
Please.  It won't happen again.
About that roadhouse -
They got a Cuban band that's the berries. Why don't we go there - blindfold the orchestra - and tango till dawn?
You know something, Mr. Fielding? You're dynamite!
Osgood - I can't get married in your mother's dress.  She and I - we' not built the same way.
Oh, no you don't!  Look, Osgood - I'm going to level with you. We can't get married at all.
And I smoke. I smoke all the time.
And I can never have children.
I don't like no witnesses.
We won't breathe a word.
I'm not doing anything.  I just thought I'd go home and have some cold pizza -
Look, if you boys want to pick up a little money tonight -  At the University of Illinois they are having - you should excuse the expression - a St. Valentine's dance.
We got it second-hand.
Tell what?
Running away?  From what?
I can't trust myself.  The moment I'd start with a new band - bingo!
Yeah.
You don't say?
Thanks, honey.
Well, there they are - more millionaires than you can shake a stick at.
You're not hurt, are you?
I quite agree.  Tell me, who runs up that flat - your wife?
No, my flag steward.
You see, I have this theory about men with glasses.
I'd like to - but it may be rather difficult.
I am?
I guess he's not going to show up - it's give minutes to one - you suppose he forgot?
Been waiting long?
Thank you.  And thank you for the flowers.
My dad is more interested in railroads. Baltimore and Ohio.  Which is the port and which is the starboard?
It's not the icebergs.  But there are certain men who would try to take advantage of a situation like this.
Harmless - how?
What thing?
They just sort of leave me cold.
Ever since then -  numb - no feelings.  Like my heart was shot full of novocaine.
I may not be Dr. Freud or a Mayo Brother or one of those French upstairs girls - but could I take another crack at it?
I got a funny sensation in my toes - like somebody was barbecuing them over a slow flame.
How much do I owe the Milk Fund so far?
Oh, no.  I'm off that stuff - for good.
According to our tax advisers, she's only so-so.  But - that's the way the oil gushes. A man in my position has a certain responsibility to the stockholders - all those little people who invest their life savings -
Oh.  The navigator just came in - we're ready to cast off.
Sorry, sir, we only serve coffee.
Big joke.  Who's the rap this time?
Me?  I'm just a customer here.
Hello, copper.  What brings you down to Florida?
Why?
Well, we all got to go sometime.
What is it, Spats?  What do you want here?
You know what I love about all this?
Oh, shut up and be happy. Its always this or that. Youre never happy, you frowny-faced Grumplestilskin.
Do you want to come in for a minute? We could talk about--
So Tony Pee-Pants starts ignoring Kat. He wanted to play with me.
You know what? Im not having this conversation right now.
Still--
Does Kat know?
Oh, no.  She tells this story at every major holiday.
I was pretty hard on her last night.  And now shes getting married.
Theres a reason I always tell that Tony Pee-Pants story, you know.
She did?
Theres something about him thats just a bit odd.
Remember when we went hiking in the lake district and Amy was wearing that little bikini thing.
Why, Jeffrey. Hello.
Seeing you again....
Let me guess. Amy presumed Id forget the rings.  I think Im her least favorite person.  You know, I am sorry.
Kat, we must talk. This guy, theres something not quite right.
Right. Seven.  Christ, thats a long time, isnt it?
Is this supposed to be an apology?
Its the past. Its nothing but ghosts. So just get it off your chest, then lets go back upstairs and eat some tiramisu.
Dont patronize me. Theyve clearly been at this a while.
You quitting?
Not the way youre thinking. The women wanted me there for support. You can understand that.
Oh, no.
I love that youre asking questions, but do you really want to get into all of this?
Dont stop asking questions, okay?
Is this for last night?
Oh, cut the crap!
When I said Id never done a wedding before, I didnt say that no one ever asked. I just never said yes.
Is he here in Borderdale?
Well, you shouldn't worry about him too much, David.
Don't tell me about what's wrong. You come into my office as a friend and steal city files! I could have you arrested for that -- and if you give out that information to anybody, that's exactly what I'm going to do -- and I'll tell everybody in this town how you got the information and who you got it for! You won't have a friend left in this county to bring you a piece of candy!
You would do that, wouldn't you?
Looks that way, son. Guess the cold done drove most of 'em down to the big water country -- but if there's one left out here -- we gotta find him.
It was too dark, Daddy.
When the fall comes in these parts, the Night moon runs away like a rabbit -- you could stay out here lookin' all night, and not see a thing out yonder.
Yep. I guess you must wonder why though, what with the luck we havin', but like I always say--
Well, looka here...
Hi, Daddy...
Do you think he's dead, Daddy?
It's a shame they won't let 'em come in here. If I had the strength I'd knock down these damn walls -- if I could just git my arms 'round your mama right now -- is they on this side of us, son?
Where did the sun go to, Daddy?
Gotta wait 'til visitin' days.
Do you know my daddy, Nathan Lee Morgan?
David, you never cease to amaze me at how good you are in taking care of my garden.
He eats all right -- his throat ain't scarred.
Mama, there's hot meat on the stove!
Mama! Mama! Miss Boatwright, say she gon' help me find where Daddy is!
I can do it, Mama -- you know that. In the Bible stories you read to us, everybody's always goin' on a long journey. Jacob goes into a strange land where his uncle is and he don't even know where he lives, but he finds him. Everybody finds what they supposed to find.
When you read it we'll talk about it...
You know where my father is, don't you, Miss Boatwright?
If they heard me sing like this up North I'd be richer than the man I sharecrop for.
Mama, when kin me and Earl go to school with David Lee?
Because he cared so damn much about you and me, child.
I wanta get some things.
I see, all right -- It's time for us to get out of this field.
Yeah, he'll crawl into my bed tonight, lie close to my body and keep me warm -- and rectify the evil in the men who live over us in this valley.
It's the rules and I gotta follow 'em. No visitin' 'cept holidays and Sunday -- and no womenfolk anytime.
There are more important matters right now...
Uh, can I finish? Can I finish? ...The fact is that we Canadians are quite surprised by your outrage-
What?
Notice that nothing happens.  Now say 'Montana.'
Pillow.
That's right, Mr. Garrison. The environment is what surrounds us. It is what we live and breathe.
Eric! Did you just say the "F" word?
Suck my balls.
Mkay.
Oh yeah.
Mph mph.
What? What do you mean you don't belong here? Relax guy, hell is for children.
Aw, ma!!
No... The General is right.
YOU GOTTA BE FUCKING KIDDING ME!!
Uhh... I'm here for La Resistance.
So... We must free more Canadian prizoners?
Be careful, dude.
We can't leave without you!
Dude, let's help Terrance and Phillip!!
WHAT?
Mom, I'm a man. Just a man. And I'm going to have fun with profanity just like you and dad did when you were little.
Sheila, you're going to far! Those are YOUR children!
And Bill?
Yes?
Yes... And in doing so, you brought enough anger and intolerance to the world to allow my coming.
We must take action on this immediately.
Uh, we're just, starting our program...
I don't care if it's dangerous! Desperate times call for desperate measures, Mr. Mackey. Perhaps I need to remind you of your situation.
The problem is you don't allow your children to think for themselves. You try to raise them in a protective bubble, and then when they finally get old enough, they realize they've been lied to, and they resent you for it.
What's going on Terrance?
Hey, relax guy. It's just a cruel joke. Rich, chocolatey Snacky Smores are only available up on Earth. He'll never get 'em, see?
Listen buttercup, let's make love and forget about the whole thing.
Do you remember when you first got here? We used to talk all night long. Until the sun came up... We would just lie in bed and TALK.
Hey, relax guy!
Well I just want you to be impressed with what I <u>do</u>. I want you to respect my MIND.
If you love somebody then you treat them with respect!  You've never respected me!
Ow, you're hurting me!
Yeah!
What's the matter, Wendy?
My friend the clitoris told me.
And ze rope?
Check.
Will you two please stop it!  I don't want to spend my final hours listening to you bitch!
I never though I'd be stuck in a wine closet with Warren Wayne.
I am here to provide service to... to all our guests.  There is a high level of passenger dissatisfaction. It is my duty...to report this.
I am here to provide service to... to all our guests.  There is a high level of passenger dissatisfaction. It is my duty...to report this.
I hear you Mac and I appreciate it. Frankly I don't know what I'd have done without you on this one.
Trust me.  Even checked 'em with my own eyes.
So, are you on for the next one?
What, and leave you here all by your lonesome?
I think I can handle it.
Barnes?
Well don't drag your ass.  There won't be much of a window for us to link up.  We'll be in your orbit trajectory in less than two hours.
Well if you knew it then why did set your thrusters on before making the calculation?
What's the use...we're gonna die...
Oh right, right you're on that research grant.
It depends on the condition of the ship.  If I could get to one of the suit compartments I could check the exterior air locks for a possible entry.
If I could get to the bridge I could send the distress signal.
Everyone just stay put.
Are you ready?
Be careful, you don't want to puncture the suit.
Don't worry about what will happen, just concentrate on what is happening.  You'll live longer.
I'm staying with the ship.  I'll be all right.  Now hurry.
Will you marry me?
Congratulations on your...recent award.
Is there anything I can help you with?
Look around you baby, we're rubbing elbows with royalty, oil sheiks, this is class.  You'll be envied by everyone.
Baby, take it easy.
I tell you, something's not right here.  How do we know they're not going to use the pod for themselves?
I'm looking for a man.
Did you hear about that bowler who got smeared? I saw them pull a body bag out of the alley. I heard he was kacked but good. They had to take apart the pin machine to get him out.
Ah, come on, lemme see your ball.
Look, Faz, Mr. Kastle was not his usual charismatic self today when he told us to tell you...  What was that he said...?
No kiddin'.
How do you turn this thing off?
The Faz sure took care a her.  Breeze makes a nasal GRUNT as he tries to suppress a snigger. Sid - trying to keep a straight face - elbows him. Sid and Breeze approach the coffin. Breeze pulls an orange whip out of a paper bag and carefully places it on the coffin lid.
Buzz Fazeli.
They suspended me for 100 years.
Sure, around here, any fat old bald guy could be king. I'm nothing. It wouldn't do any good for me to talk to the Congress.  Hey, you thirsty? You like orange whips?
Remember the finals in Akron in '59? You had a seven-ten split in the final frame.
Who gave it to you?
She thinks someone's trying to kill you.
I'm more of a bowler than you'll ever be. I deal with my own shit. I ain't asking anyone to bail me out.
I don't need the stinking pro-tour.
He'll be a barnacle on your ass the rest of your life.
No...
We ain't married no more.
The whole world thinks you're underground.
I never saw you.
Millie, I know what I'm doing.
Theo. Howzitgoin.
Nobody touches her. Except me. I touch her. Sheila told me you played bouncy- bouncy with her.
Someone wants to play with me?
I have someone for you to play Blueface with Junior.
You might say I'm at the top of their shit list.
What if he wants to get out?
Dad, this is ridiculous. Just open it.
See! No feeling. Tell Theo what happened to your hand, Junior.
Hello, Violet. How's my favorite 'bowlerina' doing?
She hit it, Mr. Kastle!
I just hold it loosely with both hands?
Who wants to know?  Zeus!
He's not here.
I think that a motorbike is one of the last really free things that people can do.
I'd rather you didn't.
Not while I'm in training.
So you're hoping Buzz can get you re- instated?
Well, that was plan A.
Come on, bargain with me.
You professional men drive a hard bargain. I'm afraid I only have five on me. Sheila pulls out a 5 dollar bill.
What are you going to do about your brother?
You got any broken bones?
Are you fucking with me Sheila? Is something gonna happen to Buzz? Sheila seems to be trying to tell Theo, but is unable.
I saw your eyes when you hit that guy with your ball on TV. THUNDER rumbles. Theo takes Sheila by the shoulders.
I'm afraid you'll hurt him.
You told Junior that we did it.
Now he's the one who's locked up and I'm the one who's free. If I gotta do this alone, I might as well start now. She revs up and peals out.
Your word is so good, you're never gonna give it to anyone.
Why is Junior's watch in that coffin? Something stinks around here.
Fletcher?  What are you doing out there?
Fletcher, get away from there...
Not everything.  Even on earth.  Take ... yeasts.
High Voltage?
Don't pull it, Norman.  It'll start a <u>fire</u> we can't stop.  Norman?
Survivors?  No, I wouldn't think so.
It's impossible.
Off the record, I don't mind telling you, this thing scares the shit out of me.
It doesn't make any sense.
What's wrong with oxygen?
Picked up something?  What is it?
Maybe we shouldn't.
Harry's missing.
You can't just leave Harry down here, sir.
She put a razor to her wrists a day later.
Bullshit.  What's out there isn't alien.  It's an animal.
I see it.
Can you open that panel?
Norman, get out of there now! Norman?
I did.
Yes, Harry.
So how do we get it open?
I have to tell you.  It's strange.
What's wrong?
Time travel.  I always thought it was one of those myths... like Santa's reindeer.
How can he be missing?
Well, until we know exactly what it is, nobody goes outside, understood?
What was Edmunds doing outside?
What sub?
Beth, look, can I trust you with a little secret?
We can't go down there.  We're not prepared.  That deep?  That takes years of training, Beth.  We're just scientists.  Lab scietists.  We wear ties and lab coats to work -- not oxygen tanks.
Norman!
The library.
What?  Why...
I mean, I'm not... I wasn't absolutely sure if... they --
"Although advised of risks, all personnel elect to remain down for duration of storm to continue investigation of alien sphere and associated spacecraft.  Signed, Barnes, USN."
Forget the sub.
Don't bother me, Norman.
It's also our only way out of here! It holds three people.  And there's only three of us left now.
Four days?
Still clear?
Deserts you?  Harry said he'd take over for me.
You don't believe me.
He acquired some sort of power.  A power to manifest things.
Does it cause drowsiness?  That's all we need.  To get him unconscious -- put him under.
What's that?
What do you mean, different?
I'm feeling better.
You know what I mean.
If I was, then I would've had to have gone in the sphere, wouldn't I?
No, he isn't.
He can't manifest.
No, he can't.
C'mon -- what?
Then where's it coming from?
Stop it!
He doesn't wait for an answer.
What are you looking for?
I'm sorry.  Slip of the tongue.
Why are you looking at me like that?
Where's it coming from?
And we're just talking about three- dimensional creatures.  What if it's five or six or seven-dimensional?  So dimensional that we couldn't even see it to kill it.
Don't be so optomistic, Harry.
You remember opening the door?
What is it, Harry?
Getting anywhere with those?
You said something to me, before -- about how we were all going to die.
Harry?
Thank you.  My suit -- Beth said she fixed it --
She's cracking, Norman.
Two and a half minutes.  Once we're in the sub.
Just pull her -- down like inside -- Harry, work with me here!
No idea.
There is one possibility.
What does Norman already know?
We take a weeny little wedge, bang on it a couple of times, and bust off a chunk of the metal.  Yet any spacecraft -- even at a low velocity, say 200 miles an hour -- crashes into the water -- it's gonna be like hitting concrete, it would crumple like paper.  But there isn't a dent to be seen anywhere.  Not even a scratch.
If it is a message, it's probably a substitution code.  I'll work on it.
What was that, sir?
Barnes.  He's very eager to meet you. Been calling us every half hour to see if you're arrived.
Oh, so you're that Dr. Johnson.
Huh?
Please, Ted.
Frankly, Ted, I'd be much happier if Jerry was just a cold, emotionless intellect.
You think Jerry has something to do with what killed Edmunds?  With what's out there?
You seen my suitcase?
We have to find he rebels... What we're carrying belongs to them.
Who's going to pay me then?
I think there are some things we should talk about.
Kid, you take the glory and the good intentions and I'll take the reward.
Is that good or bad?
I know who you are.  Stand up so that we can talk properly.  You're embarrassing me.  I'm not that important.
You saw through me?
You could put it that way.
I know your intentions.  I probably know much more about you than you realize.  In many ways you're a lot like your father.  He was an indulgent man, but a clever warrior.  Now what brings you out here?
But the Sith Lords are involved! Whatever information this R-2 unit is carrying, it must be awfully important.  They're probably looking for him... I'm no match for the Sith. This is a Jedi's work.  This is your responsibility!
That is not a human decision, not your or mine.
Luke, I'm coming along to do what I can, but I'm tired and I'm depending on you to get us through.
I rarely use it any more.  I have the Force.  The Force is more powerful than any pistol.  You shouldn't put too much faith in that weapon.  Work on becoming aware of the Force... learn to feel its presence within you.  Try to sense what it's telling you.  It's the only thing you can rely on.
You're Starkiller?
Yes, sir.
Blue Five, does that glare bother you?
Put that thing away or you're going to get us all killed.
We captured the plans in a raid on the Imperial shipyards, but we fell under attack before I could get the data to safety, so I hid it in this Artoo unit and sent him off.
Maybe the fact that no one would go there voluntarily could help us. They probably don't think anyone would dare try.
Well, I practice a lot...
They must be shielded somehow.  I'm sure the base is there.
I noticed you were having some problems, Blue Five... I thought I'd help.
Enough!  I already know about the data you've intercepted, but its' too late.  Whatever information you've gathered will be destroyed... You will come to know such suffering as only the Master of the Bogan Force can provide...
You'll get no information from me. You have no authority... the council can't hold me!
The 'Death Star' has become operational.  There is no force in the universe that can stop us now.
Something... I've got...you don't.
Whad'ya talkin  about ?
Got it. Fleet tactical wants to know where they can deploy the skimmers.
Sir, yes, sir. Breckinridge reported a helmet malfunction, and I asked him to show it to me, sir.
Are you rated to repair a Marauder power suit, Rico ?
Then why did you order your man to remove his helmet during a live fire exercise ?
How do you make him do that ?
You always told me you couldn't do human...
Johnny, this is Zander.
In simulation, my supervisors could never keep up.
Johnny, wait...
Just giving you something to remember me by, baby.
Carl can wait.
It's not you, Johnny. Your parents are rich they don't need to be citizens, and that stuff means a lot to my dad. He's a veteran.
Games & Theory ? That's Military Intelligence... Oh, Carl !
You look so... I don't know, you look like you've really been in it.
Plasma, ma'am... from the planet.
Looks like, unless Tokyo lets me start.
What ? You think I joined the Mobile Infantery because of you ?
If they didn't want you, they woulda kicked you out, amigo.
You take the stroll down Washout Lane, you're only proving one thing, Johnny.
C'mon...
You used to dance...
Hey, Diz...
Planet P ? What kind of name is that ?
Oh, my, what's that ?
We must be right over the colony. Let's get some air support, eh ?
Geez, I don't think I've ever seen him smile.
No, sir.
Wait you two. Dad and I have a surprise for you that will settle this. Can you guess what it is ?
Johnny, please. Calm yourself.
Don't get any ideas. She's my girl.
I'm gonna save Carmen.
Let's go.
Landing zone is extremely hostile. Come down on this transmission !
All dead except one, sir.
Yes, sir !
Rico, you're acting Sergeant now. My last Sergeant lost the com pack. Put together a search team and find the radio shack. We need retrieval.
What's that look like to you, Rico ?
Disclose the information.
Kirk-unit, <U>why</U> do you not disclose information?
Then V'ger must withdraw its orbiting devices.
The crews of the previous Enterprises were also carbon units. In what way is the life form in your vessel different?
What is Enterprise's proper evolvement?
Does V'ger object to the presence of the two carbon units?
As I stated, V'ger calls to the Creator.
V'ger is announcing that it has arrived, sir -- that it's ready to deliver the information it was programmed to collect...
Tractor beam strength lessening, Captain.
May I ask Why?
That's why you're staying aboard. I'm sorry, Will.
You saved the ship.
I advise caution, Captain; we can't withstand another attack.
That's precisely the point, Captain. We don't know it will do. Moving into the cloud -- at this time, is an unwarranted gamble.
The ship is under attack...! Man all defensive stations...!
Capture God! In order to retrieve V'ger's data, the Creator has to physically come here!...
Hello, Ilia.
That you left? or that you didn't say 'goodbye'?
Captain, I suspect there's an object at the heart of that cloud.
The 'puzzlement' I sensed was fleeting... minor...  ... as if carrying a sense of our insignificance, Captain.
No vessel could generate a powerfield of this magnitude...
Spock? Concerned about his chances?
Bridge, cancel rescue teams.  Spock, what in the hell are you doing out here!
Based, I am told, on your recommendation, Admiral. Thank you.
Captain Decker requested I complete final Science briefing here before...
Here at Starfleet...? The Enterprise is in final preparation to leave dock...
Captain, we need further Warp simulation on the flow sensors...
Starfleet has been apprised of our situation, Captain.
He'll eat potroast and like it.
Why don't you buy it, only forty bucks.
You wrote a play on it, what play is that?
I just got kicked off my first movie.
You like my play.
I...
First organized fire department was on the border of Dalmatia and Sardinia in the year 642.
Yes.
I understand...
Of course.
Goodbye.
Yes...
...who...?
In fact, in fact, in fact, I'm not sure if I'm giving <u>them</u> a second chance, or they're giving it to me.  That's the truth.  The truth's best, don't you think?
This is, look:  Go you Huskies.  ...what <u>I</u> see you saying, is:  you have the two elements, Fire and <u>Water</u>.  The Firehouse, and the <u>Old Mill</u>...Do you know, you could...
What are you <u>doing</u> tonight?
...lost the screw...
Never saw the point of 'em.
Read the card.
Then I'll come back, then.
Oh <u>okay</u>.
Why?
...yes.
Hi.
Hi.
Going home, yeah.  I told them what you said...
I didn't say anything special, I was just talking out loud.
Is it...
Would you like to <u>see</u> it?  I've got the key back at my store...
Best way I know to get ink on your hands.
You know what else a man can do?
But that's what happened.
Drama Group?
It's all over between us.  I've found someone else.
Well, then, what's he doing here?
What's an Associate Producer credit?
Okay, look, you, what is she, 19, twenty...oh Christ...
Uh, <u>look</u>....
She wasn't in the...
Stay ready.  Stay by yourself in your room.
Bobby, don't say anything.
That makes a <u>lot</u> of sense, Claire, that makes a lot of...list...listen, cause the audience isn't <u>coming</u> to see your breasts.  They are coming to see you <u>act</u>. What are you doing this evening...?
I don't eat vegetables.
Bourbon and Milk.
Nice town that you've got here.
She's a <u>waitress</u>.
So you see what I'm <u>saying</u>...the movie is about <u>purity</u>...
If your memory was as long as your dick, you'd be in good shape.  How long since you almost went to jail for this shit?
You guys had better leave us a...
I have to ask you these...um.  You have a valid drivers license...?
It's a formality.  Any case of damage to city prop...you hit the control box of the new stop light, and...  They'll, uh, these things <u>happen</u>, I hope you're alright, and that you're feeling...
Well, Officer, don't worry ab...
I wasn't in the car.
He's on the Island, he'll be back on...
Why?
I feel so <u>close</u> to you...
This is Joe White.
Yes, but, Joe, <u>Joe's</u> been, well, he's just been having a few, uh, "Thoughts," about...
What...?
<u>Forget</u> the contract.  Claire.  What is it?
...I can't do it, Wally...
...and, and, and did she...?  And she did the seven shows...
Wally...
"Bring it in on time and there's more where these came from.  Marty.  P.S. I want to talk to you about a product tie- in..."
Bob Barrenger...Bob...Bob Barrenger's in this movie?
Yes.
I, uh...I'm leaving.
...little woman has gone crazy about our dinner party...City Council...?  What's the trouble...?
Main Street.
I have to talk to you.
Conspiracy in Statutory Rape?  Okay.  Of whom?
Moral turp...you're on my home court, friend, I have the Mayor and the town behind me, and forget making your movie: I may own the studio when I get through with you: I got a civil suit, I got rape, I got collusion...
I'm looking for the writer.
How about that.
Half a buck I'd put him in jail...
You know, the rape, to...even to the accident...
What?
The writer.
He saw the accident...?
Sure.
...totally false...<u>totally</u> false.  He is the, I would say the most responsible human being I have ever...
We're out of money.
What's the...
Thank God, it's up to you, Pal.  Sup to you...
...that's just so <u>narrow</u>...
She doesn't show her tits!!!  She doesn't show her tits.  The breasts symbolize motherhood, the audience...
I don't know.
I...?  I saw it.  I was there.
I was walking down the street...I remember, I was writing a...
Oh yeah, I'm really gonna eat carbohydrates...
What'd you do, <u>build</u> this...?
How was your flight?
We're flying over pigs, we're flying over <u>sheep</u>...
It's just a formality.
Yeah?
Where the hell have you been...?  It's...
My golly, you know?  All my life I grew up in the city, but every summer...would you like a cigar?
It takes all kinds.
I didn't say that.  Why would I say that?
Well Daddy and I were thinking that sometimes people tell a story about what they wish would happen.
That will never happen.
I'm gonna call him.
How would you know sh...
Oh God oh God Oh God oh God oh God Oh...
I hope it's the right kind.
Actually.  I could only help him.
This'll work, huh?
Thank God.  I got to see you. Grown up.
Are you afraid for me?  Where I'm going.
This is my house too!
It's not to wear around, or any- thing, I'm <u>way</u> too young.  It's just for play.
Now Ladies, the secrets to a great pie is the crust.  And the secret to a great flaky pie crust comes from less flour and more...what?
You know, this horse smells really bad.
&quot;Goodnight moon, goodnight hush, goodnight mush, goodnight goodnight goodnight Gracie -- Goodnight Ben!
Mommy?  It's not Rachel's fault I ran away.
Rache says I have to eat <u>lamb</u>.  I told her <u>you're</u> making me <u>spaghetti</u>!
Yes.
No!  I have to get there.
I've got a lot of medicine in me, sweetie.  And I'm a little wobbly for driving or running ar...
The world.  <u>Thinks</u> I'm gone.  But only the magician.  Knows better.
People beat it, don't they?  All the time.
Planning on getting --
I'm here.
Just outside the big top, we're almo...
You can't be an 'us' just when you want to.  You can't play that card when it's convenient.
She's a charmer, you'll see.  In fifty years, the kids'll love her ten percent as much as they love you.
Yet another spaghetti night.
Luke was in the shower this morning and Annabelle sort of walked in without knocking.
She already hates me.  You've seen to that.
So why did y...
Hey.  At least it's not an editing machine.
...thinking of going back to Random House.  On a part-time basis.
I don't, but...
It's just not the right time t...
Juggle it!  Move the darkroom into your house.  You've got that room downstairs with the treadmill Luke never uses anyway.  Don't lose your confidence.  Don't lose your edge.
My advice to you?  Don't die.
Now we're going to have a fight, you and I.
And I'm going to win.
I never wanted to be a mom.  Then, sharing it with you was one thing. Carrying it alone, the rest of my life...
You'll learn.
The way you cook.  If you could make love, I'd marry you.
We have the kids this weekend, so...
For what?
I can take them to work with me -- I can shift things around --
But you're not good at this.  Not yet. I'm sorry.
Not yet.
And it's <u>my</u> call.  I promised them water-skiing, instead o...
Rache, get out of th...
It's forever you know.
Everything's gonna work out.  The kids and I...we're going to love each other.
Well, I think you should tell him you changed your mi...
Just like to make sure.  That your past.  And my future.  Are real different.
Something came up.  C'mon Ben! I've got a shoot at three...
Don't ever say that.
We're studying the Holocaust in Social Studies.
Hey. What's up?
I'm looking for a last-minute guest for my show. Any suggestions?
Be your sidekick, you know, and maybe eventually become a TV talk- show host.
Wow.  Why did your parents have so many children? I mean, if they were poor, wouldn't it be better to have just one or two?
When I'm in high school I'm not going to play any football. I'm just going to concentrate on class rank.  What did you do in high school?
But like, what do you like to do when you're not working?
My Jesus
Gee, I didn't even know you had any children. But why are you so upset about Jesus?
Consuelo, what is rape exactly?
I'm not making fun. I'm showing it as it really is.
OK, you're right, you're right  You know, we need to screen what we've gotinvite some regular people, just some random off-the- street typesand see what real people think of this.
Well, I need to see this with an audience!
What's an audience going to tell you?
Steak's really good tonight. SCOOBY  Good.
We used pull.
Look, we're not suckers. Everyone else is out there doing the same thing.
Sure!...
Fine.
I can read it to you.
You mean, again?
Well, I changed the ending a little.
Well, actually, it's the same, but longer. I think it's better. More...raw.
So you don't want to hear my new ending?
What the fuck are you talking about? What's OK?
You know he hated my story also.
Patronizing fuck! If you had just been honest with me in the first place I wouldn't have read it. I knew it was shit. But - idiot! - I believed you!
That's not fair! I was honest! Just because I wasn't sucking up like 	that bitch Catherine.
Which is it? You gotta keep your focus straight.
But what kind of pull did you have?
What DO you know?
Oh, bu...uh...I can't say that.
...gger.
Nigger, fuck me hard!!...
No, not really.
Hello, is this Pam?
Who is this?
Great!
So what's going on?
That's what I was gonna ask you.
Oh? Anything I might have seen?
That's good.
Yeah...So you're um...you're married?
Three.
Yeah. I know.
What for?
Yeah, well, it's possible they would be interested in it.
We got trouble.  That bodyguard son- of-a-bitch has them running all over the field--just took out three on the north end!
I'll lead.
Let me tell you something Cooper! I never once bad-mouthed him during all those months--
Cooper...
What about rule one:  never let the person you are protecting out of your sight!
How's the arm?
Are you going to kill us?
I suppose...you think I should thank you.
I insist...
Good.
And--of course there is the human cost, which is incalculable.
Who's Ryan Cooper?
Have you broken it yet?  We've got six more heads and that means six more hours.
What's happening at the waterfront?
Drop the anchor!
Thank you, Admiral.
Don't be ridiculous.
If he's not there, try...  87 - 43 - 56.
What's the meaning of this?
I am sorry.  Sub-miniature photography is my hobby.  It's amazing what excellent en- largements you can make from the negative.
Mister Ambassador, what on earth possessed your country to build this weapon?
The source was...shall we say, completely reliable.
This dreadful accident could never have happened if your government hadn't cynically and hypocritic- ally blocked every proposal we made for disarmament or arms control!!
Excuse me, Mister President, but you forgot to give me my camera back.
Don't worry, Major.  Your rights will be fully protected.
Colonel, don't you know what's going on?
Sure I do.  There was some kind of mutiny on the base, and you killed General Ripper.
I want him upped to Brigadier General, and recomended for the D.S.C.
All right, Major.  I'm putting the base on condition Red.
But...what kind of a shooting war?  Have they hit any of our cities yet?
Yes, sir.  I just thought of something, sir.  How do I know I'm talking to you now?
What's the gun for, General Ripper?
I didn't mean for anyone to play anyone else's radio either, Major.
Yes, sir.  General, can I ask a question?
And a condition red means enemy attack in progress, doesn't it?
That's close enough, Major.
I suppose we might catch them off their guard.
Where, sir?
You're very naive, Major.  Don't they say they want disarmament?
I've heard the arguments.  Like Napoleon's quote, "There's one thing you can't do with a bayonet, and that's - sit on it."
But if they suddenly opened up and gave us the inspection we want, we'd agree, wouldn't we?
Do you think they would cheat?
I'm afraid so, Mister Presient. Being part of the air-borne alert, each plane is carrying a full load - about fifty megatons apiece.
Yes, sir.  The base commander, General Ripper, selected Plan-R?
We don't operate like you KGB boys.
I believe it will be just a few minutes, at the most.
He says they've only shot down three planes.
General, stick to the point, please.
You've lied to me twice - I'm sorry, but it will be strictly routine.  These men are experts.
We should be crossing the coast in about six minutes.
He's right.  They must have clobbered some of our cities already.
Then this is it.
What?
War.
Just the missiles.
Yeah?
When do you want to arm the bomb for the primary, Major?
Master safety.
I bit his jugular vein.  Now will you shut up and get up here???
Recall what mistake?
What do you mean?
Right.  So how could we get any messages?
Lieutentant Zogg, how would you like your black butt slung into a General Court Martial when we get back???
Are you sure?
Thanks, King.  I've always wanted to take one of these big babies in.
But, look here, Von Klutz.  Won't this nucleus of survivors be so shocked, grief-stricken, and anguished that they will envy the dead, and indeed, not wish to go on living?
We are?
I don't anymore.
You know, one moment things are so fucked up than you look at it from a totally different angle and it makes sense.
Intense.
Well, you shouldn't drink. Are you gonna drink?
You can see it. Whenever you want. Don't you, um, work at a hospital or something?
Any gunshot victims?
Guy should cut down on his caffeine intake.
Buff, that slice is the difference between life and death for some half-dead Bangladeshi.
Stuck, who? What guy? Huh?
Stuck with what guy?
You said you didn't want to get stuck with some guy. What guy?
Don't let 'em fight.
Same, more of the same. Yep, just keep doing the same thing all the time, around and around the clock. With an occasional burger or slice of thrown in for our vitamins and energy. Then, instead of watching Gilligan, we'd watch Captain Kirk.
Ah!
Go!
Fuck it!
No, no.
Good.
No, I mean, no one.
No.
Wait. Hey, man.
Look.
Oh, really? You wanna go look?
See, I wasn't making shit up, man.
God, Tim lied to your ass, man. That guy's sad, man. Well, uh, I gotta go, but, uh, listen, if I don't come back, I'll send a video of me surfing. Alright, man? Get some rest. Go with the flow.
I don't think I like that guy's attitude at all. Hey, you know what? Take off the blades. I mean it. I'm gonna break your fucking legs. Take 'em off.
They are old, we are young, they are fast, we are fun.
Oh, how did you get burnt-out?
Score! Yeah!
You owe me twenty cents. Come on, seven-twenty. Seven-twenty.
Good. See you later.
Whoa!
What's up guys?
Who's going to slow me down? You, you fat pig.
You just seem to know all these things about me and I don't know anything about you, you know. What kind of music do you like?
Military marching bands.
"It's not a job, it's an adventure." Right? I hated it. I had to get out. So I was working in the kitchen, chopping lettuce, you know, real heroic stuff, and I, uh, I had this big fucking knife and I chopped off the tip of my little finger and three days later I was a free man.
What was your name again?
Erica.
Deep down. Way down.
Oh, wow.
Oh, you were excellent tonight, Pony.
Mm.
Buff, sit. You know what I mean though? Somebody ought to crack that guy with a baseball bat.
Hey, he's a human being you can give him that much.
Well, it ain't no pup tent in the garage, you know what I mean? Fuck. So they'll talk and talk. They'll probably talk all night. And, oh, they'll decide that they're gonna spend the night together, right? But, you know, they're gonna keep their underwear on and they're not gonna do anything. By six a.m. he's parking the pink Cadillac. Fuck. There's really only one answer.
No, no, say it like this. Fuck 'em!
That chick, Erica?
They let you out?
You want to know what your problem is, Jeff? You want to believe so bad, you'll buy anything. It's true. Look at you. You're gullible and you're gutless.
Good, good. I, I hope he does.
You don't know?
Tim, can we go? This is ridiculous.
This has nothing to do with me! She went up by herself. Yeah I tell them don't go on the roof! They can't go on the roof!  How is she?
So you can give me more shit?
Like what?
Hey!
Yes, I stand for -
You know, all you know is what's good for you.
Well, if you love him so much, why didn't you go see him play?
Yeah.
Us.
No, no, see, that's not what I'm saying. I could go to New York if I wanted to, but what's the point? So I can learn how to order a cappuccino? So I can get mugged by some crackhead? So I can see, see homeless people up close and personal?
Yes, you do.
Gee, Jeff, I thought you were gonna go take a piss, not join some alcoholic nudist colony.
Wait, wait, wait a minute, Sooze. What are you doing?
For a ride.
Wait, away?
I've run out of words.
Well, what about us?
What about us? I'm moving away your staying here.
Wait, no, I... Look, Sooze, I figured something out.
What?
Hey, the driver knows Billy Idol. Wow, huh?
Well, not exactly.
So who are you?
I don't know. Uh, I'm an artist, I guess. You know, there's life and then there's the people watching the life, commenting on it.
Yeah, well, that's what I do too.
I gotta take a piss. Do you mind if we pull over really quickly?
I'm sorry. I, I gotta...
Get off my property!
Look, get down now, you fucking drunk! You bum!
Oh!
Sometimes, yeah. You know, I started to do performances.
You have to go. You always did such, uh, you know, great work. I still have some of those drawings that you'd do in study hall.
Yeah, and I was thinking, Sooze, you could do the cover.
Soon.
Erica? She said she was tired. She went back to the hotel.
Pal, she's a big girl, you know? I'm sure she's alright.
If you hit me...
It's not the air force anymore, Scuff
Uh, excuse me, I'd like to know where he gets his ideas.
Tim's jealous, you know? He wants to have ideas too.
Sorry, Kansas...
I'm in, too.
You sure?
No.
WHAT?!  That's insane!!!  Why would I go to the police?
Jack...
Oh... What are you working on?
NO!  Wait...um...  We're the A-squad from Lincoln High? So, uh...
No.  This is Diane.  I think you have the wrong number.
My daughter's always dreamed of bein' a cheerleader.  Put her on your squad and I'll give you the guns.
... Ja-ck B-ar-t-le-tt... Is Jack Bartlett interested in me?
I-I didn't mean to say "whore," Diane. I just hear it so much at church - it kinda came flying out of my head.
Hello?
...my Sunday School teacher says that in prison, women shove broom sticks up your...
You got that big retarded girl down there?
Wait a minute.  You watched the Apple fucking-Dumpling Gang?!
Bank branch!
I know, but it keeps down the size of my can.
More proof God's a guy...
I hate to think where that puts me.  I could be her father.
It must be about that appalling script of hers.  What can I say to her? What can I say?
We're ready with the shot, Mr. deMille.
In a deep freeze.
You're going to stay, aren't you?
I'll take it.
Carefull Those are dirty words! You sound like a bunch of New York critics.  Thank you, Miss Schaefer.
Perhaps the reason I hated Bases Loaded is that I knew your name. I'd always heard you had some talent.
I've been hoping to run into you.
Now if I got you correctly, there was a short stretch of my fiction you found worthy of notice.
I called your agent.  I called the Screen Writers Guild.  Finally your old apartment gave me some Crestview number.  There was always somebody with an accent growling at me.  You were not there.  You were not to be spoken to.  They never heard of you.
Dark Windows.  I got him all hopped up about it.
O.K.  Where's the cash?
Sorry if I crossed you up.
May I say you smell real special.
Twenty-two.
Hey, what's the matter... Betty, wake up!  Why are you staring at me like that?
Betty, there's no use running out on it.  Let's face it, what- ever it is.
Whose?
Why did she call me?
All my things? All the eighteen suits, all the custom-made shoes and the eighteen dozen shirts, and the cuff-links and the platinum key- chains, and the cigarette cases?
Then you could have picked up the phone yourself instead of leaving it to one of your assistants.
Don't play innocent.  Somebody named Gordon Cole.
Nothing.  I just didn't realize what it would be like to come back to the old studio.  I had no idea how I'd missed it.
Get out.
I know your face.  You're Norma Desmond.  You used to be in pictures.  You used to be big.
They're dead.  They're finished. There was a time when this busi- ness had the eyes of the whole wide world.  But that wasn't good enough.  Oh, nol They wanted the ears of the world, too.  So they opened their big mouths, and out came talk, talk, talk...
Look at them in the front offices -- the master minds! They took the idols and smashed them.  The Fairbankses and the Chaplins and the Gilberts and the Valentinos. And who have they got now?  Some nobodies -- a lot of pale little frogs croaking pish-poshl
It's the story or Salome.  I think I'll have DeMille direct it.
You can stay here.
I don't know why you should be so upset.  Stop that playing, Max.  It seemed like a good idea -- if we are to work together.
Honestly, it's a little old hat. They don't want that any more.
They don't?  Then why do they still write me fan letters every day. Why do they beg me for my photo- graphs?  Because they want to see me, me, me!  Norma Desmond.
They've come for my car.
I need some money right now.
It is to me.  That's why I came to this house.  That's why I took this job -- ghost writing!
I don't need any clothes, and I certainly don't want you buy- ing them for --
How about some evening clothes?
You know, to me dressing up was always just putting on my dark blue suit.
Shouldn't we wait for the others?
Who?
The other guests?
Shut up.  I'm rich.  I'm richer than all this new Hollywood trash. I've got a million dollars.
What right? Do you want me to tell you?
To fall in love with you -- that was the idiotic thing.
I hope you realize, Norma, that scripts don't sell on astrologers' charts.
I'm not just selling the script. I'm selling me.  DeMille always said I was his greatest star.
What on earth, darling? It took you hours.
I don't think so.  It's your script.  It's your show. Good luck.
I haven't done anything, Norma.
What are you doing, Joe?  What are you doing?  You're not leaving me?
It's yours, Joe.  I gave it to you.
These are nothing.  You can have anything you want if you'll only stay.  What is it you want -- money?
Thanks.  Say, she's quite a character, that Norma Desmond.
Good.
I just found out why all those tele- phone calls.  It is not Miss Desmond they want.  It is the car they want to rent.
Had to get away for his health, I suppose.
Of course, we're always looking for a Betty Hutton.  Do you see it as a Betty Hutton?
Any kind of assignment.  Additional Dialogue.
Did the deceased ever threaten you? Were you in fear of bodily injury?
You know better than to interrupt me.
Now, now do you belive me? I told you deMille would jump at it.
But the phantom Zone is for criminals.
It couldn't be helped. The city will have to make do with three.
Yes! You own the Coffer of Shadow. Nothing can withstand its power.
Let me out. I have to talk to you.
But be reasonable. If I don't do something to stop her she'll try again. And maybe hurt you.
We can't do that.
We're from different worlds.
No.
Away. From you.
Hi.
Hello. Are you still mad at me?
You think so?
What's that big black scar on the ground? Like a fire.
Yes, yes I saw the whole thing. How could you be interested in that puny little girl?
What about my proposal?
I've been in love with you for years. Remember how you used to visit your sister in the newsroom? And put your fingerprints on my lens.
I am almost an adult. This is what I want.
Years ago. And it was Zaltar who stole it.
Superman will return it.
Where is Earth?
I can do that.
Linda babes! There's this all-night party at Eddie's... his folks are away...
Listen, I know I've been saying you ought party more, but keep your hands off this one, will yak? He's private property. I've been waiting years for him to develop.
Bianca's taught me all! need to know. I'll be safe, as long as I don't go too far.
I have to talk to you.
Nothing's wrong with my skin.
You would! You revealed our existence so you could have all of our power.
What's it like?
No, no. Not lovely. 'Perfect'. Did everything just right. Nobody telling you to change this, move that around. Please yourself. That's the secret of happiness.
Then teach me how.
I heard my mother ask you once "how could a man with such a selfish heart create beauty?" She was wrong, Zaltar, you have a generous heart.
What's that? Never saw anything like that.
Aha! What'd I tell ya!
You're welcome...??
Mayonnaise? Donald loved mayonnaise. Why would you think that was the problem.?
But all he had was chocolate milk.
So...how much longer do you think you'll be in Smallville --
No, what you said before, Could I make it in Metropolis? I've dreamed about it, sure, but I never really thought about it.  What would I do when I got there?
But if you wouldn't mind settling for me --
You're the best, Lois.
It's practically an American ritual, Mr. White! Isn't that so, Jimmy?
Yeah.
Thirty-five.
Man, them people was crazy! How they 'spect you to learn all that jive on the first day? "Hold the pickle! Hold the lettuce! Extra onions! Special sauce! No special sauce!" Ain't nobody found no meat inside that glop yet.
Don't call me a bum! I ain't no bum!
What about this week's check?
The boss wants to see you.
Now me, I was born rich. I've never worn the same pair of socks twice.
Columbia.
Always making yourself beautiful for me, aren't you?  So, Gus, can you make Vulcan do what I want it to? You didn't answer me, pal.  Did you hear about that prison riot last week? It seems they were complaining about rats in the cells...
It ain't. It's nowhere. It blew up. That's how come they shipped the dude to Earth when he was a baby.  well. I know some stuff too, y'all.
That's what I been thinkin' about. How you been keepin' me.  I ain't getting' nothing outta this gig.
What will it get me?
I told you it wasn't no jive.
Remember, Gus. A machine doesn't want anything except to keep on being a machine. You've got to make sure it can figure out how to beat any opponent.
Watch out for them air pockets!
Who is she?
I'd wash that out with some iodine...  Okay, Mercurochrome.
He was asleep before his head hit the pillow.  Well, this was only the biggest day of his life. I really don't know how to thank you.
Listen, are you sure you shouldn't do something about the bridge?
I'll do more than tell you. I'll show you, back at my place. If you'll just do me one little favor first.
How would you know?
Mr. White, you be in this shot, handing them their plane tickets.
She's not his mama either.
Small potatoes.
Where did it come from?
Wait for Gus to get here, sis.
Anybody been hurt?
Hah, some guys say I have magic fingers.
I mean it strikes me funny that every time Superman comes around, you disappear.
Superman? Oh, was he here?
"What's happening." Oh, is that the understatement of the year. Well, so . . . where do you want to . . . talk?
Let's go to my place.
I know, I know all the arguments, you don't have to tell me. That's what I did all night -- I "listened to the voices of  reason" till the dawn came up. Do you have any idea what a vile sound it to hear the first bird singing when you've been up night crying?
Everybody. Everybody else. I'd be buying my little rainbow at the their expense. All the ones who say "Help. Come quick. Now" I know who you'd have to pick.
What??
What else is ballast for?
You thought about me in a parka. That's sick, Lex. Really.
A gang of terrorists seized the Eiffel Tower in Paris
Game plan! It's fourth down and long yardage, the two-minute warning sounded and the ball's deep in our territory! How brilliant do you have to be?!
Because that is your heritage. Those are the values we lived by on Krypton.
For many eons the peoples of our world have lived together in harmony. Then there appeared among us three anti-social elements - what on Earth are classified as "criminals."
The one danger we have considered is that the Phantom Zone might - we cannot predict - just might be cracked by a nuclear explosion in space. I cannot say I am glad you asked me that -
Shhhhhhh!
Constantly.
Me? I'm loaded with good! I mean I've never even used it.
I knew you'd double-cross me, Luthor. A lying weasel like you couldn't resist the chance . . .
Who is this . . . Superman?
You'll find out, General! And when you do . . .
This "super" man is nothing of the kind. I have discovered his weakness.
I missed you. It wasn't any fun up there with just Lois and Superman. They're so boring. Let's go do something wild!
Hi. Is dinner ready? I'm famished.
Gee, I'm really sorry.
Maybe if you'd have met who I am now, instead of the spoiled brat you met a few weeks ago, it would have been different between us.
'Are you or are you not part of a plot to weaken our national defense?'
Go on . . .
No, Daddy. Our business is journalism. We can't continue to be so irresponsible . . . or else we'll just lead everyone into a disaster.
Whoa. . .
What was that about?
Didn't you see it? He lifted me up and crashed me down.
You are . . .
I am an experiment? I am freako?
What do you fear?
Know something? You're a workaholic. A good guy 24 hours a day. Stop and smell the roses sometime. Take up a hobby. Get a pet . . . a kitten or a puppy. . .
I'll ignore that . . . So, I created a monster who didn't work nearly as well as I might have liked -- you were clearly his better  --  he needed more energy, more power.
Nobody wants war. I'd just like to keep the threat alive.
But . . . but isn't the world about to be osterized?
You'll be designing monuments soon, Albert! Hotels! Palaces!
That the planet blew up on May 23, 1937. That the rocket ship with the revolting little freak in it took three years to reach Earth. Ergo?
Albert!
Me?
It was hot, yes.
She's in California. That's wild enough, I guess.
Clark...Son...that...thing you did with the Sheriff today... those...stunts...you don't do those things at school, do you?
Don't worry, Mom. I know.
Do you know where you're headed?
Your bookie?
Some people aren't the athletic type.
Unbelievable.
Can I take you to the airport?
You were probably so scared you didn't look to see what the trick was.
The bald man! The one who tried to kill me?
Again???
I'm going to bed.
A night on the town instead of under it?
Not exactly. But it's his kind of neighborhood.
Tea?
You are one of Krypton's greatest scientists Jor-El -
All these years, happy as we've been, how I prayed and prayed He'd see fit to give us a child. And just when I finally accepted my bitter lot...  No one must ever know.
Their atmosphere will sustain him. He will look like one of them.
He will be odd, different.
I don't know what to say.  Look, I -- I just -
Here's the story on that East 19th Street murder spree. Page one with a banner headline seems about right to me.
The answer is yes. Now what's the question?
This is incredible. I was just sitting here trying to figure out how to contact you. I mean, you don't have an answering service, right?
What about this X-Ray vision of yours?
Not there!  A pine tree in Death Valley? Idiot! This is for the North Woods section!
Well, gents? What did I tell you? It's a piece of cake.
What is this??!
At the San Andreas Fault. Maybe you've heard of it.
It would never have worked, Luthor. You are a dreamer  --  a sick, twisted dreamer.
Maybe I should get help.
Luthor  --
How is Mrs. Stephens?
I'm glad to hear that Zoe's okay.
She's in trouble?
Well, it was nice meeting you again, Mr. Stephens.
Say hi to Zoe.
Mister, I don't want to know your name.
That's my daughter.  Or it may be the police to tell me that they've found her dead.  She's a drug addict.
I don't know.
So what brings you out tonight?
I don't see how that concerns you, Billy.
It does concern me.
Why?  You got money from Dolores' insurance with the school board.  We all did.
Have you been waiting long?
A while.
Your kids never cry.
Mr. Stephens says that someone didn't put a right bolt in the bus...
Is it true that you gave Nicole one of Lydia's dresses?  That she was wearing it when the bus crashed?
About the Ottos?
From what?
A strange little fellow, but you couldn't help liking him.  He was close to ten but seemed more like a frightened five or six.
Well, it's certainly what you'd call interesting.
I didn't say that.
Away from your crazy Mom.
Summer's over.  It's fall.
It's like a song.
Yes.
Should I keep reading?
They work for the people we're trying to sue.  Their job is to try to minimize damages.  Our job, Nicole, is to try to maximize them. You have to think of it that way. As people doing their jobs.  No good guys or bad guys.  Just our side and their side.
It was snowing.
I object to the form of that question.  Note that.
Note my objection.  She said, 'As I'm talking.'
Note that she said 'pretty clearly'. Not 'clearly'.
She...she was a friend of mine.
What do you mean?
Here we go.
You always think you know what I'm going to say, don't you?  You always think you're two steps ahead of me. The lawyer.
That's not news, Zoe.
Oh God, I'm scared.
Please, let me explain.  I'll only take a moment of your time.
Did there come a time when all the children had been picked up?
You remember that much?
Yes.
I was scared.
You could see the speedometer?
That was great.
Mrs.  Ansel's clothing.
How do you like it, Nicole?
You and Mom have a lawyer?
You're going to need special care for a long time to come.  It's not going to be easy.  Not for you, not for any of us.  Because we love you so much.  And it's going to cost money.  More than we can imagine.
Yes.
It's too late for that.  She can't drive the bus anymore.  The school board saw to that right off.
Joe, give my nephew a drink.
That's a nice tour.  All booked?  When was Susie around here last?
Blessings on thee, the both...well... Gotta run now.  See you two kids later!
Why, has he bothered you before?
Son, lots of people tell me I'm a gifted man, but I still can't see around corners.
May I lift my eyebrows?  What is this?  What are you trying to do?
Why are you trembling, dear...?
It's just as if I've seen a ghost today...
Then whose fault was it, J.J.?  It was someone's fault, wasn't it?
I thought we were talking about Sidney?
You want something done, J.J., but I doubt if you yourself know what's involved.
When?
Well, what have I got?  Alimony to a pair of tramps?  They're of no concern to me.  It's you who count, but don't get me wrong - I don't intend to let you break your neck again!
How?
Get Steve back his job...please...
What does that mean - integrity?
What are you so chipper about?  If I put a cross on every one of your mistakes, you'd look like a graveyard!
Listen with care - this will cost me everything, so you know I'm telling you the truth!
He goes out with girls.
Well, I'll be darned.  And what does J.J. think he SHOULD do?
Don't tell me you started a polka with Leo Bartha?
Don't you know who that man is?
And he's a perfect stranger to me.
It isn't.  I've just seen the early edition.
But...
Pay the rent.  Let the tailor wait.
Dallas, ask your own manager - he's standing here like a pained wolfhound - Hunsecker and Elwell are enemies to the knife.  So how do you get him doing J.J. a favor?
Frank, you don't listen!  J.J. just told you to shut your mouth!
Speak to this lad, Al, ... to Mr. Falco.
Do you think J.J. likes Steve...?
You haven't told him yet...
Hello, Steve.  I'm glad you could come.
Steve...what you tried to do today...you tried to take me up on a high mountain...I couldn't go all the way...I failed you...  Will you forgive me?  Have I lost you, Steve?  Have I...?
No!  I'm saying that for your sake you have to make a clean break with your brother!
What chip?
Look, whatever you want me to do, I'll do.  I just want my kids to have a chance to grow up, okay?
This in intense.  Get a grip, John.  Okay, uh... you're not here to kill me... I figured that part out for myself.  So what's the deal?
You sure?
Typically, the subject being copied is terminated.
Oww!  Why'd you do that?
Swear.
Yeah, or "later, dickwad."  Or if someone gets upset you say "chill out."  Like that.  Or you can do combinations.
Chill out, dickwad.
Here.  I wish I coulda met my real dad.
Why do you cry?
Uh-unh, no, it's different... It's when there's nothing wrong with you but you hurt anyway.  You get it?
She intends to change the future somehow.
The T-1000 has the same files that I do.  It could anticipate this move and reacquire you at Dyson's house.
We don't have much time.
I don't trust it!  These things are hard to kill, John, believe me, I know.  We may never have this opportunity again.
I know!
It has helped me a lot to have a goal, something to look forward to.
Basically.  The Skynet funding bill is passed.  The system goes on-line August 4th, 1997.  Human decisions are removed from strategic defense.  Skynet begins to learn, at a geometric rate.  It becomes self-aware at 2:14 a.m. eastern time, August 29. In a panic, they try to pull the plug.
I have detailed files.
I'm sure it feels very real to you --
Oh! And don't wave your hands about!
Eating is eating... and...
When he made his decision, he couldn't have known everything. Especially not the way people like you do, who've returned from exile and feel that you have a right to pass judgement. Because you are blameless, you think you know best who is a sinner and who deserves forgiveness. But you have no idea how people lived here.
I guess you admire musicians.
Yes, David?
Isn't it true that before every concert you got a woman in your dressing room and gave her the old conductor's baton, isn't that true?
Your manner.
Major, he may just be the greatest conductor of this century and that merits respect.
What museum?
You live here, in Berlin?
Your mother, too.
I'm kidding, Emmi. What about a record player? You have that, too?
No. Ours was damaged.
I'm sorry.
Of course.
I don't think Dr. Goebbels sent me a telegram. I was simply told. In a letter, I believe. I don't remember exactly.
That... that was a different matter, I... I was tricked.
May I ask a question?
I believe it was because of another letter I'd written to Goebbels lamenting the decline of musical standards due to racial policies.
I have a list of names here, people in your profession, who got out in '33. Bruno Walter, Otto Klemperer, Arnold Schoenberg, Max Reinhardt...
How?
If it's too hot, open your tie.
What telegram?
We never, never officially represented the regime when we played abroad. We always performed as a private ensemble. As I think I already told you, I was a freelance conductor.
have no idea what ordinary people thought.
Well. Once he said he'd read what this man wrote about me.
This is absolute nonsense!
Well, I'm just beginning to develop my theme. Isn't that what you call it in classical music, developing your theme? Okay, so they played on your insecurity. That's human, understandable. But, there is one guy who doesn't like little K as much as he likes you - yeah, the number one man your old pal, Adolf. He thinks you're the greatest, and when he says, I want Wilhelm for my birthday, boy, they better go out get Wilhelm. So, Josef calls and threatens you with little K. And you said to hell with the Ninth in Vienna, I'll give it to Adolf as a birthday present in Berlin. That's the trick they played, they got you by the balls and they squeezed. Hard. Why did you stay? Why did you play for them? Why were you the flag-carrier for their regime?  Jealousy?
What?
No, I'm not going to stop it. Hitler himself offered you a beautiful house and a personal bomb shelter.
I don't understand what you mean.
I believe that. But just answer the question, don't give me explanations.
That's what I asked.
Show me.
You usually don't work on Sunday, Major?
What?
Yes.
So, you never heard of him.
Nope.
Well, they say here that when you went on a case, you stayed on it.  Now we can't take every Nazi in this country to trial, although I would like to; it's an impossibility. So we're going for the big boys in industry, education, law, culture.
No, I was never a Nazi, I have no interest in politics, I'm a musician -
Brave?  To celebrate Hitler's birthday with some heroic piece by Wagner but without the Nazi salute? Bravo.
I don't know.  I kinda had my heart set on being a cashier the rest of my life.
Mmm.  Same schedule's okay.
That bum.  So what if he has a Porsche, he can't treat you like that...it's Friday night for crissakes.
I'm going to a movie, kiddo. See ya'.  You and Matt have a good time.
Just let me go.
This is gonna make me puke. Talk about something.
John never said much about him.  He dies.  Even before the war...
You volunteered?
And anyway, what do I know about guerrilla warfare?
Good field-dressing.
Sleep.  It'll be light soon.
That's where we're going.
Is this enough?
I don't think I like this.
And who was the enemy?
You go naked.  Something about the field generated by a living organism.  Nothing dead will go.
Surrounded by living tissue.
Here, drink some of this...
Lieutenant, are you sure it's them?  Maybe I should see the ...bodies.
Why don't you just stretch out here and get some sleep.  It'll take your mom a good hour to get here from Redlands.
Go ahead.  You're safe.  There're thirty cops in this building.
Here's her driver's license.
You gotta be kidding me.  The new guys'll be short-stroking it over this one.  A one-day pattern killer.
I just called.
Go!  Go!  He's got her.
Our E.P.S. was one fifty last quarter.  We're up eight cents per share.
I only mention it because I took the test this afternoon, down on Montgomery Street.
Pardon me... Miss... ?
Oh, God... !
This is nuts.
There's got to be a flashlight.
Where'd you all go?  Motherfucking frat boys.  You better hide.  Is your life so pathetic that this is something you're willing to pay for?
This isn't an attempt to be gallant. If I don't lift you, how are you going to get there?
Where are we going?
I know the owner of Campton Place.  I could talk to him in the morning.
Want anything to drink?
Take the picture out.
It wasn't his fault.  He thought it was his only way back.  They fleeced him real good.
I'm back from the dead.
Nicholas...
Where'd you get that... ?
... what... ?
What the fuck are you... ?
It's mine...
We searched the house.
He's got a gun.  Everyone, he's got a <u>real</u> gun up here!  Real situation!  ... damn it...
Nicholas, this is fake.  It's all part of the game...
Think about it!  They followed you every step of the way.  There was always a safety net.  The taxi, there was a diver.  At my house, the window was rigged... they shot at us with blanks...
Underwear?
Conrad, what a surprise.  Gesundheit.
Okay.
Okay, okay... okay?  I just... you know I hate surprises.
Calm down.  Why would they keep playing after you paid?
Because you hate me.  Because you had to be here, when mom died.  Because you had to do it alone.  Well, don't you think if I'd known... I'd've been here too.  I'd have been here...
I'm sorry, Christ, I'm sorry!  How many more times do I have to say I'm sorry before you forgive me... ?
Really?
We'll help with the police, if you want to bother.  As far as money goes... can I make a suggestion?  You say you were mugged?
I know, look at me, well...  What happened?  I don't know.  I don't even really know.  I have some things to try to take care of... I need the car a little while.
It's just a t.v.  He's just an actor.
One guarantee.  Payment's entirely at your brother's discretion and, as a gift, dependent on your satisfaction.
What are you gonna do anyway?  You won't get your money back.
Where?
You know, these fit... perfectly.
Is everything alright?
I've finished for the evening.  Will you be needing anything else?
Look... what I'm doing is none of your business...
I wasn't expecting you.
Just what I told you.
You know what I love about wine that comes in bottles like this?
So why did you need the Addam's Family mansion for a scientific test?
That could have been worse.
I gave my key to the gate to Todd, but the Dudleys'll be here in the morning.
Nell!  What's wrong?
You'll never see it again.  Mr. Dudley's taking care of it.  I'm sorry, Nell.  Can I show you something you'd like to see?
I don't know.
Nell, the first time I ever spoke with you in person was the night we met here.
Me?  No.  What are you doing here?
That's where she hanged herself.
Why?
Mrs. Dudley.
It's a job.  I keep banker's hours.  I set dinner on the dining room sideboard at six.  You can serve yourselves.  Breakfast is ready at nine.  I don't wait on people.  I don't stay after dinner.  Not after it begins to get dark.  I leave before dark comes.  We live in town.  Nine miles.  So there won't be anyone around if you need help.  We couldn't even hear you, in the night.
And what you're wearing, that's great, too.
What's his first name?
Maybe you did it yourself.
Why?
My place isn't like yours, Nell, it doesn't have a view of sea.  It doesn't have a view of anything. What's interesting about the way I live is what goes on inside the walls.  Living with me... My boundaries aren't very well defined, Nell.  Do you know what I mean?
Why?
That's what Gordon's always saying.
Italian.
Hey, I thought you weren't a buffet person.
We think?
I'll point you in the right direction, but you'll have to take it to the end- zone.  He's a hit-and-run gunman -- I figure he's not cruising the Polo Lounge.
Our black friends?
Why, because you're my security consultant?  This cocksucker nearly burnt my house down.
You could use a few of my prime shitkickers up here.
I wouldn't talk.
I can take care of the paperwork.
CQ what?
I mean, what has it been -- six months?
Terry Valentine.
She didn't write to me, did she.
Who'd Jenny get it off of -- this grass or whatever?
I think you didn't get that lot in the Navy, doing your National Service.
What do I do, then, look in the bleedin' Yellow Pages?
Huh?
What?
Why didn't you just kill him, you had the chance.
Not much -- you?
Sounds like Beverly Hills.
Three seasons.  They found that's the limit of human tolerance when it comes to following the adventures of a family of Mormons on the Chisum Trail.  I was wife number three -- the ingenue.
Oh, it just ended, then.
Now who's being sarcastic?
She never told anyone else.  About the convict strain -- or is it stain?  No, I was privileged.  I was someone who helped Jenny efface her past.
You weren't disappointed in her, then.
He give me your address.
Lives high off the hog and waits for the next big thing.  Like me -- but on a grander scale of failure.
-- Mr. Lindgren.
I thought you said you never did an honest day's work in your life.
In what capacity are you employed by this Mr. Lindgren?
So what's the deal.  You and Terry Valentine at twenty paces.  Is that what this is about.
Oh, I was gonna say ...
I don't believe it.
-- they want Southern, I do Southern, they want Midwest, I do Midwest, they want tall, blonde, and twenty-two, I'm shit out of luck.  One thing I can't do is English. Americans can't.  Shouldn't even try. And Laurence Olivier couldn't do us.
Yeah, well, you're here now --  -- where <u>h</u>urricanes <u>h</u>ardly ever <u>h</u>appen.
She told me you were a ghost in her life. Daddy the friendly ghost.  Coming back to haunt her.
Up the coast.
How far?
There's one thing I don't understand.  The thing I don't understand ... is every motherfucking thing you're saying.
And that is?
Turned that place completely around.  180 degrees.
Out on a oil rig.  In the North Sea. Nine years.
But first I gotta give these lads a talking to, these geezers what sent me up the river, in a manner of speaking.
How we gonna get that lucky?
I don't want you here, Terry.
-- You know his name is Frank.
Hi, Mr Crane.
Hello, Mr Crane.
...or maybe I just haven't played 'em right, I don't know. But you're--
Sure... Sure, it's his house.
I know you haven't. Look, just go meet him as a favor to me. I talked to this guy. Hope I pronounced his name right. He sounded very busy, but he's not a bad egg; he loosened up a little when I told him how talented you are. He agreed to see you this Saturday. He said maybe you were a diamond in the rough. His words.
But more or less.
I'm only sorry that I didn't play better for you. I know it would've made you happy. You know what you are?
You're an enthusiast.
Birdy--
Ze girl?... She seems like a very nice girl. She *plays*, monsieur, like a very nice girl. Ztinks. Very nice girl. However, ztinks.
Is not so hard to understand. Her playing, very polite.
Come in, come in, siddown over there. Coffee?
What's involved, aside from putting up the money? What're you looking for the partner to do?
Do? Hell, nothing. Well, you'll want to keep tabs on your investment, of course, but I'm looking for a silent partner. I've done the research, I've contacted the vendors, the deal is set. I'm just looking for venture capital, friend. Disappear if you want, check in whenever you like--I want the dough; I don't take attendance.
...You bring a check?
...Were you in the service, Ed?
What kind of man *are* you?
I, uh...
Told what?
...My first instinct was, no, no, the whole idea was nuts. But maybe that was the instinct that kept me locked up in the barbershop, nose against the exit, afraid to try turning the knob. What if I could get the money?
How's that?
Honey.
I knew about it. Big Dave told me about it, and the spot he was putting himself in by getting the money.
Not guilty, your honor...
'Scuse me, just finished dinner. Um. Frankly, Doris'd be better off with the county defender.
Haven't I seen you up in ladies' wear?
Uh-huh. Some beat, huh?
Yeah.
...I'm Rachel Abundas. Everyone calls me Birdy.
They sent us to tell ya. We pulled the detail.
What'd he say?
'Lo, Ed.
No, he's family, he's my brother-in- law.
Crane? We have to tell you, as soon as you're conscious--is he conscious?
What'd he say? Does he understand?
Manual overrides aren't working.  I'm getting nothing, Lieutenant.
This huge police presence tonight isn't necessary, Lieutenant.  You'll just scare people off.  I can handle the security behind scenes with this system.  It's state of the art.
I told you!  They seal off all the cells.  They were designed to fall automatically in a system failure --
Where the hell are you?
The body?
Can't really focus on birds at the moment, Pendergast.  I'm tryin' to keep my breakfast down.
In this violent world, I believe the only way to stay sane is to take time to notice beautiful things.
Curious.  There's something missing.
No, Margo.  This is one problem you can't solve.  You have to stay out of it.  The fact is, I want to retire.
That Cuthbert.  What a piece of work. Someone's dead and all he cares about is his Superstition Exhibit.
What are they?
That's not so unusual.  Many plants carry viruses.  Like the burls on Maple trees.
What's going on?
Do you mean Dr. Whittlesley?
And failed.  These doors are solid steel.
Dr. Frock, I was wondering.  What happened to the rest of Whittlesley's plants?
Way cool.  Then you know where the dinosaurs are.
We were just lost, okay?  And we went down this curvy staircase.  At the bottom was a big shadow.
The dogs have lost the scent, Mr. Pendergast.  Maybe we should head back.
That's impossible.
What do you make of it, Margo?
Got to finish this thesis sometime.
Maybe not.
John couldn't have anything to do with a horrible thing like that.  He was a fine man despite his problems --
What happened?
What if Whittlesley arrived on the tepui and no monster was there?  Was he desperate enough to create one?
I don't think so.  I think we were meant to think it was Mbwun.  Did Whittlesley's monster have claws?
Where would we find it?
Where did you see it?
What was it?
Wounded?
I don't know how to deal with this. It's hellish.  Like nothing I ever saw.  I'm not trained to deal with a monster, a supernatural creature like that.
I think... it means it's full.
You have to!  Listen!  All viruses pass on their own DNA.  Instruct the cells of the host to make more viruses!  This one was different.  It inserted a whole array of genes into John.  Reptile genes, sixty five million years old.  Those genes remade him!  It's not his fault!
When do you want to leave, remembering, of course, you do lose a day on the way there?
He moved down there after Meryl packed up and left.
Why would we--
Thank you.
He was curious from birth - premature by two weeks, as if he couldn't wait to get started.
And the show now generates a yearly income equivalent to the gross national product of a small country.
No, of course not.  And since the show runs 24 hours a day with no commercial breaks the staggering profits are all generated from product placement.
Yes, everything you see on the show is for sale - from the actors' wardrobe, food products, to the very homes they live in--
There's nothing on the show I don't use myself.
Actually, I'm free Sunday.
I think it's got something to do with my dad.
I went all over but I never found a place like this.  Look at that sunset, Truman.  It's perfect.
Just between you and me, Marlon, I'm going away for a while.
It's a lot of world for one man.  You sure that's not wishful thinking, you wishing you'd made something more of yourself? Christ, Truman, who hasn't sat on the John and had an imaginary interview on "Seahaven Tonight"?  Who hasn't wanted to be somebody?
So what are you saying, Marlon, the whole thing has been in my head--?
How did it go today?
I won't be here Sunday.
Let me get you some help, Truman.  You're not well.
--What the hell are you talking about?!
No.  You said, "Do something."  Who were you talking to?  Tell me!
--What are my plans now?  Well, next I'm thinking of tackling the Yuba River in an authentic canoe from the Algonquin tribe. --I'm talking about the north fork, a class five rapid - only I'm not going <i>down</i> the Yuba, I'm going <i>up.</i>  Do you honestly think for one minute I'd go back to some dreary office to rubber stamp meaningless documents...do you?
You know surprises aren't good for me. You should really call before you come over, dear.
You look very pale, Truman.  Are you taking your vitamin D's?
Sure.  Okay.  Fine.  Can you pass on a message?
I'll try.
You've been back to Dallas?
Are you going to let us in on what exactly you're trying to prove --
-- those are very serious allegations, Agent Scully --
What is it you find incredible?
No. No...we need to try our vaccine on it.
You got some kind of business with him?
What's that?
You're saying they destroyed an entire building to hide the bodies of three firemen...?
How?
You've been using me --
Your ass? I just got chased across Texas by two black helicopters.
Did you find something?
What's wrong, Scully?
Where are you, Mulder?
Why?
I was until about an hour ago.
Mulder -- what are you doing?
According to this tag.
Scully -- listen to me. I'm going home, then I'm booking a flight to Dallas. I'm getting you a ticket, too.
Mulder --
You said you weren't coming?
I wasn't planning on it. Particularly after spending a half hour in cold storage this morning. But I got a better look at the blood and tissue samples I took from the firemen.
Hey, I was right about the bomb, wasn't I?
I've got to be in Washington D.C. in eleven hours for a hearing -- the outcome of which might possibly affect one of the biggest decisions of my life. And here I am standing out in the middle of nowhere Texas, chasing phantom tanker trucks.
You're on the verge, Mulder -- please don't do this to me --
I think you're in anaphylactic shock --
Where are we?
Agent Mulder -- we both know that if you and Agent Scully hadn't taken the initiative to search the adjacent building, you could have multiplied the fatalities by a hundred --
She's in there right now saying the same thing about you.
How deep does this go?
Where's Scully?
Until Dallas, we believed the virus was simply a controlling organism. That mass infection would make us a slave race.
Let me out. Stop the car.
How?
You need not kill a man to destroy him.
She adores you.
I've heard this argument before.  It's not happening.
Yes mother.
...a pocketful of rye.
Why'd you bring him here?
This is going to sound terrible, but... I don't think she matters anymore.  Not to him.  He never finished her.  The others...he was able to make them his.
This is Stargher we're talking about?
It's hard for me to see Stargher as human, capable of something like "remorse."
Then what is he?
I told you.  You have to be optimistic. Believe in them...
Agent Cole.
What about the legalities of this...?
Thanks you.  Six weeks off does a body good.  I heard she got the approval to try the reversal with Edward.
I don't have to.
Warscheinlich ist der murder.
Oh, American, thank you. I like them.
He was Harry's driver?
I don't know. They didn't answer.
They're forged.
Harry?
The Porter is going to talk to us tonight.
I can try. Is it comedy, or tragedy?
What's that?
When...what did you do?
Tell me more.
I thought you were going to go away. Aren't the police after you?
What happened to your hand?
He's better dead. I know he was mixed up - but not like that.
Seventy pounds a tube. He wanted me to write for his great medical charity.
...is there?
He's safe in the Russian zone.
...quarrel?
Cigarette, Miss Schmidt?
Thank you.
Must you take those letters? CALLOWAY Yes, I'm afraid so.
Joseph Harbin's body was found in the coffin.
Here we are. You'll be all right here, Miss.
Could you buy me one. I haven't got any Austrian kroners. Thanks.
Him dying like that.
Ever seen one?
Tactful too, aren't we, Callaghan?
A parrot bit me.
Oh, stop behaving like a fool, Martins.
I followed his shadow until suddenly...
Be sensible, Martins.
Shall I go over there, sir?
Get me Major Callaghan on the phone.
...excuse me.
You do!
...leaving tomorrow, sir.
Listen, Harry - I didn't believe that...
What can I do, old man, I'm dead, aren't I?
Part? You can have any part you want, so long as you don't interfere...I have never cut you out of anything yet.
Speak English?
Baron Kurtz.
und ich kann nicht alle kennen.
Er, alive? He couldn't have been alive, not with his head in the way it was.
Police? Why police? Das ist alles blodsum was sie da sangen. No, no. It is all nonsense; it was an accident.
Der ami macht mich noch ganz deppert. I should have listened to my wife. She said you were up to no good. Gossip.
Yes, it is.
...Mr. Martins?
With him.  Fifteen Stiffgasse.
I'm sorry, I don't think so.
You go to Patpong? See smoke from pussy, ping pong ball from pussy, razor blade from pussy; bird from pussy.
Why not? Thai girls best in the world. Thai food best in the world. Thai dope best in the world.
The noise? Don't worry. You're on holiday.
Yes.
She is gone!
One kilometer
Exactly.
No one follows that midrash.
Read the early Zionists on European Jewry; they sound like Goebbels.
They sound like you.
Didn't you see <i>Raiders of the Lost Ark</i>?
Where did you read this? Robert Faurisson?
You gave fifty thousand to that college magazine.
Fifty's an exaggeration. Anyway, that was a different moment. Things were possible that aren't now.
You will.
Too Christian. You know Jameson? Paul Virilio?
You're not in school? What do you do?
They're my father's. He's from Argentina. My mother's family went there during the war. That's where they met.
No.
It looks a little like a swastika.
V'asitem...
Don't curse in front of it.
You shouldn't.
No, I think you shouldn't.
What...? You think I'm Jewish?
Okay...  Why don't we light candles on Friday? Let's light candles.... And say the kaddish.
He commands it whether He exists or not...  Look, we can fight him and be crushed. Or we can submit.
I thought there were people here....
Shema yisrael adonai elohenu adonai echod.
Why are you taking that?
An investment banking house.
They're liars and cowards.
Jewish girls like to give head, right?
Because the Jew is essentially female.
Does that mean the Jew is the better lover?
Let's just say I've done due diligence.
Are all Jews the same?
Why would Nadelman lie?
Give me a reason not to.
Did you kill Ilio Manzetti?
You know the joke: a Jew's shipwrecked on a desert island. When they rescue him, they see he's built two synagogues. They say, for vhat do you need two synagogues? He says, vun to pray in, and vun I'd never set foot in so long as I live, so help me God.  You pray in the one you'd never set foot in...and vice versa.
All right, what if all along you were actually infiltrating the Nazis -- to expose them....
I can't say that.
I don't do that.
...I want you to do it on the outside, too.
I'm not here to talk about religious law, if you don't like --
Then he couldn't be bitter about living alone.
They're not my people....
The Polacks? From Sacred Heart?
What about Drake, did he ever show up?
You said they didn't have night guards.
Who even knew?
Mrs. Moebius.
Take a right on 59th...  We'll put it someplace else.
She's at Yale Law -- interning with the district attorney...  We're getting married next spring. In Israel.
How?
The Torah says not to light a fire on the Sabbath, because it's work, correct?  But if alternating current's running through the wires every second of every day, and I throw a switch, send it here instead of there, how is that lighting a fire?
After your mother died, that's when you stopped going to shul. Doing your homework. Everything.
Do you think I...
This is a great pleasure.
Yes, the Mamma is is there.
Because he won't understand and it will just hurt you... Jacques has been put on earth by complete mistake.  And he's only waiting for one thing:  that some God up there will turn him into a fish! How long has that moron been down there?
In my village, we have a saying: when the wind blows, the flags of all nations flap in the same direction.
And where did you say you were from?
You don't mind if I go instead, do you?
That's good.  You never would have recognized me, huh?  Check out the suit! Looking good, no?  You know I'm the world champion?
No.
Tell me, why don't you go and get your medal?
I give you this.  You're stubborn... Dumb, but stubborn.
That's good.
Please, have a seat.
You look adorable.
Hello?
Do you know how it is?  Do you know what you're supposed to do to meet a mermaid?
You sure?
Bonjour Monsieur... Louis. 
What's wrong?
Anything.
Mayol... Mayol... No reservation.
Well?
What?
But... how is he going to breathe?
You've made me a happy insurance person.
Good thinking. We'll disguise ourselves as a Gentile couple to pass undetected. Now that he thinks I'm dead, this should be a piece of homentashen.
You like my Mordechai, yes?
My name is Esther. Chief Bloomenbergensteinenthal from the Jewish Defense League desperately needs to speak with you.
I said, yeah, about once a week!
What are you doing here?
Mordechai. Do you love your mother?
When I play bridge with all the girls, everyone has what to talk about with their sons. They show pictures. Their sons are lawyers and doctors and Rabbis. Why can't I show a picture?
No. No. We're gonna argue. And you know what mom? I'm going to save Hanukkah just to spite you. And when my face is all over the television. When your friends are opening their Hanukkah gifts next year, don't mention it to them, okay? I wouldn't want you to have to show my picture.
Hello Mazel Tov! A boojee boojee boojee boo...
Okay, what's the information?
I understand that. I just thought that you might want to know.
Cool. What's it do?
Man, that's far out! Hey, the Jets won!
Listen cat, I'll have you know that I hate the taste of watermelon and am a terrible basketball player.
So, what's our first plan of attack Santa?
What should I charge?
Is he in love with you?
What about me?
Of course, not, Charlie. I never thought you did.
Look, Charlie, just be patient. I'll fix everything. You don't want that cat, anyway. It killed two people.
What's left of him.
You and your cards. Meet a rich man! I look for them with money. What rich man hasn't money. And for what was I born if it wasn't for money? You're not telling me anything.
What, senorita?
She's a local. When the dudes come out to New Mexico, they went to wallow in Latin glamour. This is a bad town for blondes.
You're lucky. I wish he'd front page for me.
I mean you being a star and me being just a cigarette girl.
Of course. It's the way any decent man would feel in your position.
Yes?
Jerry, I talked to you about the habits of an ordinary wild leopard. This leopard is another matter entirely - - a caged animal travelling around with Charlie How Come for years and years.. That's why it kills human beings.
It doesn't know how to hunt its natural prey.
But it doesn't eat what it kills.
About Charlie's leopard?
Charlie doesn't think the leopard killed the girl in the cemetery.
I don't mean that. How would he act? What would he do?
He'd act normally when he was with other people. It would be a man who suffered remorse and even pity when it was all over.
No. He would be a hard man to find, Jerry. Particularly if he were a clever men. He would go about his ordinary business calmly and coolly except when the fit to kill was on him.
Tell me.
Tormented -- ? Why?
Well, I'm next. You won't hear anything like that, Mr. Galbraith.  I'm not a popular favorite since I let the leopard loose.
I haven't done any posse work since last time I rode with Toni Mix at the old Bijou Theatre -- aged six, If you're interested,
What are you getting at?
I've been trying to tell him, Sheriff. He won't listen to me.
Chief, don't you understand what this means?
Makes no difference. Get him out!
On his back, I suppose.
Get it out of here!
Suppose I slip them a few bucks  for the funeral expenses.
It must be the altitude  you, bucking around the countryside with a lot of bootandsaddle boys --
	As long as my feet held out.
I know. Funerals.
I'm glad you care about us, Kicks. Sometimes that gets kind of lost in the racket --
Kiki?
It's a lovely town - it was until we came and let the leopard loose and all this happened.
Nobody? Huh!... How come?
Maybe for the same reason that made someone somewhere not consider this a spot to build the Getty Museum...
Ha-ha... Yeah...  What about that road back there, though? It says closed to the public, doesnt it?
De Moraes? I was asked here by a Mrs Spitz.
For your information, Mr Lombard, trouble is possibly the one thing Leon is capable of getting into all by himself. Though I doubt he will not ultimately fail even at that.
Can it be that easy?
Disney! How inter...
Your brother got mixed up with child procurers  and tried to make this world a better place, Mrs De Moraes. And having rescued one little life he unwisely set out to repeat the exercise.  You dont mess around with child procurers. Right now my guess is hes either on the run, held captive, or dead.  I understand your misgivings, Mrs De Moraes. But Ive seen the boy and made telephone contact with the man Leon bought him from. If anyone knows what happened to your brother it will be that man. Which leads me to why Im here at such a late hour. I need 20,000, in cash, by 11 this morning.
You could say that. And Friedman left this morning for Los Angeles.
The man who sold the boy to your brother.
You watched the tape?  Friedman and his people dont just provide little kids and videotapes, Mrs De Moraes. Theyre in the import-export business. They run hotels here in London which they probably use as ware- houses and ports of call for their merchandise.
Paul Lamont...?
Im really sorry you were not called...
Or is it the other way round? The children are needed because you cant satisfy him?
You... You are out of order, Mr Lombard. I...
Huh! Dont you recall convincing me he had?  You should learn to live with your mistakes, Mr Lombard. There is some merit in it.
Leon hung himself...
Think what you like. But dont presume to understand.
And you still havent told me why you sent me after Friedman.
A fright?... Five years of cowardice led to your brother being murdered and you wanted to give his murderer a fright?
So you did talk about it, huh?
What do you suggest?
The word for those things is croissants.
You wouldnt have a cigarette, would you?
Well, Id sooner mug an old lady...
A criminal?
Then find another way.
You cannot walk away from this. You cannot.
Im calling about the puppies.
Have we done business before?
Who are you?
Yes. Friedmans the fuckin Austrian!
Where?
What?
I dont know...  This is just a delivery place, man! I swear I dont know where the kids are... I work for Martin, thats all. Martin knows. He works for Friedman. He knows...
What company?
B-Black...
The Hyatt. Good afternoon. May I help you?
La collectionoose. Its about a young girl in the south of France who seduces a different man every night and then meets one who resists her. Its on TV tonight and as Im in I thought we could perhaps look at your accounts and... The review says its about the conflict between intellect and instinct. And witty. The directors supposed to be famous. Rommel or something. French. You must know him?
Should I?
So you havent seen the film, then?
Didnt you say I came recommended?  Thats what I thought. May I know by whom?
What do you think has happened to your son, Mrs Spitz?
Do what, Mr Lombard?
Then you should not have sought an explanation.
Why do you think your son chose not to come to you for funds for his photography, Mrs Spitz?
Look at it this way. He might achieve everything your son never did.
Vous tes Franais?
Is my money in there?
Six weeks ago. He bought a boy of yours.
This one came back and was never seen again. I understand Friedman looked after him.
Maybe you should. Think about it. Those who can afford our goods do their thing without upsetting anyone. Those who cant do it to kids from the streets or their own family and it makes upsetting headlines.
Im overcome by your public-spiritedness.
This is the hotel supervisor, Mr Lamont. Im terribly sorry to disturb you but theres been a mix-up with our bookings which you might be able to help us resolve.
Have you?
And while visiting our fair city you...  An Austrian?
An Austrian... Not much to go on, is it?
Evening. Table for one?
Im sorry...
Good reasons?
My sister... She lives in the next valley.
And you aint neither one of those damned Mexicans who end up littering the landscape after getting ripped-off by their friendly cross- border guides, are you, mister?
Los Angeles is 100 miles away.
Barstows 30 miles to the left. Los Angeles a hundred to the right. Wherever youre heading, I reckon somebodyll pick you up.
What about which girlfriend?
Oh. Thatd be Rhian, a Welsh chick he used to lay at weekends. She got wise and dumped him months ago...
Jai bien peur quil te faudra attendre.  Pas avant la matine.
Bye. And thanks... Nathalie gently closes the door, eyes Lombard who shakes himself awake... rolls her eyes and surveys the room...
O est pass ton salon?
Alors quoi?
Some guy called to let him know the Frenchman whod called the night before he left London was in L.A. looking to kill him. He did his sums and decided to take the call seriously.
Youre sure he said his caller was a man?
When they realise Im missing...
Are they still operative?
That's a good idea, sire.
Why, are you not ready to die for your king?
Sire, you know how bad I am at this sort of game.
It's a miracle she's not dead!
Listen, please accept my apologies for... you know, me pretending to be the... well it wasn't really my idea... well, yes it was my idea but...
I shall also be needing a war horse -- mine is too slow -- and armor -- and a good sword -- and an artist to make me a banner.
This I can do.  I was studying at the University of Paris -- till the English invaded it.
Jeanne, calm down.  You can't blame the people -- they've been hearing all about you for weeks.
What did they say?
Not so... easily.  Why aren't you... fighting...?  go on... we're almost there...
What did the king say?
Good advice for the French, not for the English!  Do you think God hates the English?
And didn't you order the citizens of Paris to surrender the city in the name of the King of Heaven?
No... I said "Surrender in the name of the King of France"...
To avoid killing anyone.
Yes, maybe... I don't remember...
... so you were in the middle of the battlefield, with your sword in your hand, waving it above your head... charging against the enemy, screaming and yelling... fighting for your life... and you want us to believe that in the middle of all this excitement you never killed anyone?
Well... at the coronation of King Charles VI...
I'm on the side of our Mother Holy Church.  Besides, a confession under torture will never convince anyone of her guilt.
So... here is the famous Jeanne... Savior of Orleans... terror of the English?  You look pretty ordinary to me...
Am I... am I dead?
Were you baptized?
Many things...
Let me clarify things for you, Jeanne.  On the one hand there is the Church Triumphant, that is to say God, his saints, and the souls that are saved.  And then there is the Church Militant, that is to say our Holy Father the Pope, the cardinals, the prelates of the Church, the clergy, and all good Catholic Christians.  Moreover this Church, when assembled, is guided by the Holy Spirit and therefore cannot be in error.  That is why we ask you to submit to the Church Militant... that is to say, us.
Please... may I have it back...
Buying her?
W-w-what has that got to do with this Maiden?
But... her army's so small now...
... You look wonderful...
Get them out of here!
Now hold on -- you're not captain here... on the battlefield perhaps, but not in the royal bedchamber!
Not exactly.  She wants you to give her an army -- at your expanse.  Bearing in mind that your mother stole every last piece of gold in the treasury, I fail to see how you can afford such an adventure.
My dear loyal Tremoille, I know I can count on you...
You told us about the appearance of this... voice.  What exactly did you see?  Part of it... or all of it?
I'm more interested in what he says, not what he looks like.
But if the devil were to take on the physical appearance of a saint or an angel... or a man... how would you recognize him?  By what he said?
That's not a lot.
It is all his majesty can afford. He has even donated his very own personal savings.  His majesty will greatly appreciate a gesture of good will in this delicate negotiation between our two families.
May I, without offending you, inquire how generous?
For what?
Well.  I'd love to see that, but after taking counsel with my captains, I felt it would be better to first bring the food into the city, then wait till Alencon arrives with reinforcements before doing anything.
Well...?  Shall we go?
Not yet.
Calm yourself, Xaintrailles.  Now slowly.  Who has finally done what?
I do love her when her fire gets well and truly stoked!
There must be something we can do for her for Chrissakes!
Clear?
He never sent them... Don't you understand?  He doesn't want this war anymore... he has his crown now, that's all he ever wanted...
Tell us, Jeanne... why did you jump from the tower at Beaurevoir?
Stop it!  What are you doing?
Jeanne, let me introduce the king's half brother, the dogged Lord Dunois.
What happened?  Who gave the order to attack?
Five steeds and a few hackneys...
Still, pretty wealthy for a peasant girl wouldn't you say?
YOU THINK GOD ISN'T BIG ENOUGH TO DELIVER HIS OWN MESSAGES?
WHO ARE YOU TO DECIDE IF YOU SHOULD LIVE OR DIE?
They won't come anyway.
Why would they?
Yes... lots of things!
No, but... he sent me so many signs!
Yes... yes!  And now you tell me why God let all these battles happen in the first place... if he's so powerful... he said he's "the creator of heaven and earth, the source of all life..." he could have easily stopped all this blood and misery?  Why didn't he?
Is he the one who spread all this blood and misery?
No, no, you did fine.  I'd even say well done.  Besides, most of the ones you killed probably deserved it, don't you think?
Why are you doing this to me??  Do you get pleasure from hurting me?
Yes...
Good, good.  And your sister... Catherine -- she's still your best friend?
Then what will?  And what will bring her back?  And why did she have to die in the first place instead of me?  Why didn't he take my life instead of hers?  It was my fault -- I was late -- she gave me her hiding place...!!
I've always loved your playing, Mr. Szpilman.
I'll be fine.
Yes, but sometimes I'm still not sure which side of the wall I'm on.
Where do you want me to go?  Look at me. No, no, I'm not leaving. Can't I take my chances here?
Can you help?
You sell anything?
Just one. Dostoevsky. The Idiot. Three zlotys.
Well, you know what's funny? You're funny with that ridiculous tie.
They were taking you away.
It's nothing to do with you. It's me they wanted, not you. Why do you interfere in other people's business?
You're mad, that's your trouble, you're mad.
Five hundred. You know how many people on average read one copy? Twenty.  That makes ten thousand readers. These will start the uprising. Majorek hides them in his underpants. And leaves them in toilets.
I have to say you look terrible. What's the trouble?
Pig!
It's easy to get out, it's how you survive on the other side that's hard.
No, no, no, I'm staying put. If I'm going to die, I prefer to die at home.
What's all that gunfire?
Are the Russians here?
I don't know how to thank you.
My REAL father was a famous German composer
Which mountains are those dear?
I got the good wife for you Peini. She pray good. Clean. Read Bible. You sleep her Peini. She chief daughter.
You'd have to organise it up here.
I'll have to come and hear you play. what do you play.
You don't want to learn.
No.
Well, I doubt I want it very much myself.
It's my mother's piano.
She wants it to come.
What does she say?
Play a gig.
You the owner here?
Which way are the rooms?
Give it to me!  Please.  I gotta know it's all there!
If that punk and his pals decide to search ya, you'll never fool 'em carryin' it there.
Paltrow, Sterling, Furey, and the Big Alabama are in from New Orleans. Fiskin and the Boone Kid from Denver, and Phillips, Barnett and Limehouse Chappie from New York. Those and the guys outside should give ya 30 or so to choose from.
You think my play is bad?
But you played the Big Con.  You said it was nothin'.  A game for flakes and mama's boys.
Straighten up, kid.  I wouldn't turn ya out if ya weren't ready.  I got a guy named Henry Gondorff I want you to look up.  There ain't a better insideman alive.  He'll teach ya everything ya gotta know.
Salino?  Why waste our best people on a small-time job like this?  It ain't no heavy gee we're after. The guy's a five and dime grifter.
He was a con man, wasn't he?
Hey, Luther told me he was carrying a wad, but I didn't figure this much.
Straight north.  He was gonna take it all and run.
If you saved a little, you wouldn't have to grift so much.
You could buy yourself some things. Clothes, or a nice car...
I thought you blew all your money.
Mottola.
They workin' for anybody?
What about the other one?
I don't care.  Load me a deck.  Set it up for threes and nines.  I'll cut it in on his deal.
Aw, I conned a Senator from Florida on a stocks deal.  A real lop-ear. He thought he was gonna take over General Electric.  Some Chantoozie woke him up, though, and he put the feds on me.
You can't do it alone, ya know.  It takes a mob of guys like you and enough money to make 'em look good.
Right down to my socks, turkey.  If I'da been half as scared a that lop-ear, I wouldn't a fallen asleep on 'em.  Lonnegan might kill me, but at least he won't bore me to death.
It was too noisy.
What's the matter, kid?  You're not sayin' much.
Take it easy, you won't lose him now.  We had him 10 years ago when he decided to be somebody.  Believe me, I've seen enough to know.
Yeh.
Looks like he's sulking.
Raise 300.
If ya win it could make ya, too.
Gondorff asked me to look after ya.
But what about all these other people?
She don't work here no more.  I'm fillin' in for a couple days... till I can get a train outa here.
No.  What's wrong with the front?
Looks like he missed ya.
Yeh, he knows that.
That's worth fifteen grand to ya?
You're not gonna break him with a $2,000 bet.
Why don't ya then.
I think we oughta place another bet tomorrow.
You want a drink or something?
You've already done time twice, and judges don't like three time losers. You wanna sit in the can for forty years, startin' tonight?
Will you wait until the chump is played?
Hell yes.  We don't care about the mark.  He deserves what he gets.
We'll take it.  You manage the building at the end of the alley?
Do ya know him or don't ya?
Come on, gimme a break.
Darling, your father's all right. He'll turn up in time.
Why did that man want to kill him?
You're talking like a crazy person,
Dorothy.... listen to me. I love you.  Don't you understand that? I love you.
You're high enough.
What is it? Has he found him?
He's all right.  Isn't that enough?
You hand that over to the police.
I'll do nothing of the sort.
I don't believe it! You're lying!
Is your father still in there?
Did he tell you where he was going?
Of course we do! We've been friends for years.
Come on in.
Where did you get this gun?
Yes, she would.
What would your mother say to that?
I'd like to see him.  Why don't you bring him down?
Goodbye, darling.  Don't you dare forget...  December 30th.
Man to man, Mr. Charles, are you working on this case?
What about this Nunheim?
Who're you calling?
Lucky thing for us they weren't in that lime.
Shut up.
I know he'll turn up as soon as he sees this in the papers.  You can't think he had anything to do with it, Mr. Guild.  He wasn't the kind of man that....
You say you were in the room with the body from the time you discovered it 'til we came?
That's all right.  Well, we'll be going.
A brown suit, brown shoes and a white shirt and a grayish tie with red, or reddish brown figures on it.
Good morning --
What's the idea of telling me you just knew the Wolfe girl by sight?
Just what I said I'd do.
You wouldn't do that...  you wouldn't!
This is the first time I've seen him in years.  I didn't want him to think I was high-hatting him.
No.  I just came back for a second. I wanted to get those bonds.
I'd never tell you to sell those. I bought them for my daughter.
Do you realize that you're accusing me of ....
That's my business.
I want that money right now, or I'll hand you over to the police.
Oh, please, Nick.
What'll I do if something comes up?
You know as much about it as I do. I haven't seen him in three months.
Oh, I know he didn't, but I wish I could find him...  I have something very important to tell him. Macaulay won't help at all.  He thinks I just want money.
I tell you again, I don't want any part of it.  Now you take Dorothy home and...
Chris may be at the club -- or somewhere -- I don't see that it's important --
Perfectly absurd.
What did he pay you, Mimi, to stick to that story?
I'm lot going to stay here to be insulted - 
That's all swell.  Only you're peddling your fish in the wrong market. I've got nothing to do with it.
Listen.  "Studsy" Burke told me you used to be O.K. That's why I'm here. Do  they....
How is Studsy?  I didn't know he was out of stir.
What's that?
Why do you say that?
He's well-trained.  He'll behave himself.
Who is she?
Six Martinis.
Sounds like a good case.  Girl mysteriously murdered.  No one knows who did it.  They haven't found any clues yet -- no gun -- no fingerprints --
That poor girl is in a tough spot.
You idiot!  Asta! Stop that!  Get down!  Now, stay there.
Want a drink?
Nick, listen.  From Clyde Wynant!  "Will you take charge of investigation on Julia Wolf murder. Communicate with Herbert Macaulay".
Sit down!
What's the trouble, Asta?  Your balloon busted?  So's mine.
He's just been for a walk.
Why, I believe the little woman cares.
He was down in the shop.
Wynant's body?
Nick, you'll drive me crazy.  What things?
What things made you so sure?
I've got a lulu -- why?
Who do you think did it?
Come on out, now.  He won't hurt you.  Back to your old tricks, eh, Tanner?
How did you get in here?
I'm sorry.  Tanner, don't you want some wine?
Yes.  Nick!
Maybe she has.
I just wanted to tell you...
Baghdad.
Well, based on my knowledge of the region, its culture and her people I would have to say it's a box.
I know you think this is crazy, but a couple of hours from now you're going to be one rich dude trying to buy up every other puzzle box out there.
What are we going to do!?
They stopped.
Wha...
He's an idiot, and he's not nearly as hard as he thinks.
What if it's a Valloro 69?  Just going to bounce right up out of the ground, explode in the air, kill him and us.
There's nothing we can do.
I don't know.  There's a lot of space up here.  They could be just about--
All right.  Let's break out some utility shovels, lanterns, and a claymore in case we have to do any blasting.  Me and Jaeger'll climb down, and see what we can see.
Epps!
I don't think the line will take the weight of a man and the coins.  Wes!?  We'll send the gold up, then me and Jaeger'll climb back.
What about the gold?
Maybe you've got ideas of your own for the gold.  Maybe you've already got things worked out.
No.
Lot of good you were when I was sinking in the sand.
Wes, we thought you were dead, and we thought we were next.  Hanging around to get killed wouldn't have done anyone any good.
I told you, I'm shooting Iraqis.
Wellllll, if you read it it must be true. Was it in the Star, or the Enquirer?
Take the binoculars.
Yeah.  Yeah, she's fine.
Don't drink up all of yours, 'cause you aren't getting any of ours.
What?
Just be cool.
How'm I gonna relax standing on a mine!?
We're going to be right over here.
My leg is falling asleep.
When we start running suck up your breath.  You're going to get the wind knocked out of you.
Something like that.
We're not going to do anything.
There's another pass on the photo.  We can avoid that narrow one we had to cross on the way up, and it should get us back down.
How!?
No.
I don't want it this way.  I wouldn't kill you just to kill you, but I can't let you lose the gold for me.  Not when we're so close.
Epps?
We've got to keep moving while there's still light.
I just want to look at it.  Remind me of what I'm dying for.
Place all alone like that?  Must be a boarder check point.
Which boarder?  Saudi?  Kuwait?  Syria?
I don't know.  They killed Wes.
Why haven't they killed us!?
How do we do that?
Somebody has to.
This whole time, you've kept your head. You didn't go money simple like me and Wes.  You've just been trying to figure how to get us out of here.  And you've been fair too.  I mean, even after I...you know...
Still am.  There's more gold than I thought, and since there's only two of us now...  Where should I go?
Well, this is it.  We get the car, find some Americans.  We find Americans we'll be all right.
I'm looking for a favor.  I need a map of Iraqi.
Planning on going to war all by your lonesome?
Ready for what?  Sight-seeing?
What?
It's right here.  This region; an-Nagaf. I got recon photos.  There're no troops there, no fighting--
Epps, you're smarter than this.  Jaeger I understand, but you're smarter.
I don't know.  It would be small, easy to transport and hide.  Gold or jewels. Probably gold.
We're American soldiers.  We don't abandon people.
Maybe they're as scared of us as we are of them.
What do you think?
Permant cortex bond.
What's this?  Why did you change it?
I have to see SEN.  I've just been given a shift change.
Now?
That's not food.  Can't be food.
Don't take anything.
No....I though  I'm afraid.
You don't know.  You don't....
I can just barely see him.  I think he's leaving.
He's coming back for the rest of us.  He can't make it alone.
I won't have another mate like ONA.  You rate very high in sanitation.  I've checked.  In fact, I am surprised that you were ever matched with LUH.  Her ratings are very erratic - you know what I mean.  We'll be happy.
I'll report you.  It's....
I'm leaving.
We've lost SEN!
Who?  Me?...I don't know.
...rooms with her.  Our relationship is normal, conforming.  We share nothing but space.  What is she doing to...
-Where?
How's the print coming?
So you're the "Device Squad"... and you defuse "devices"?
Hey, look--
No you look, mister! First, you don't go calling my men names. It's bad for morale. Second, us "punks" happen to know a heck of alot more about police work than any vice cop ever did.
So what were they doing here?
Not bad for Bomb squad, eh?
What's up?
How do you know?
Off the scale.
More metal... sharp edge...
It's from an IRA.
We've lost brothers too, we know what that's like.
Cover.  It was suppose to be abandoned buildings, y'know. No one was suppose to get hurt. The night you busted us...We were checking to make sure there weren't any vagrants around. Scare them away.
You touch me again and--
Nothing so far.
I'm filing charges against that mother-
It don't work-
Vice cop on a homicide?
Device.
Looks like Pooch's doing okay.
Look, I saw these guys, I can i.d. them.
What's this?
Yes, sir.
Reilly, what the hell are you-?
And it had diamonds in the back.
And diamonds in the front.
M'sieu Giron is downstairs.
<u>Niente!</u>
I'm sorry, but I don't seem to recall the occasion. No, I'm afraid ...
Yes, Baron.
Yes, Baron.  Moon in champagne.
Yes, Baron?
You must be related to the Lavals of Marseilles.
I hope you find the figures correct.
Two weeks and three days.
Yes, m'sieu.  M'sieu Giron!
I know it!
M'sieu Monescu!
Darling!  Now tell me--tell me all about yourself. Who are you?
Right.
And tomorrow is the fifteenth. And the day after tomorrow--
No--not yet--but--  Two tickets to Berlin--first class and sleeper--night train ... Right ... Right ... Leave them in the name of--Don Ignacio Fernandez ... Right ... Thank you. 
Thirty-five to the left--sixty- three, eight ... I wouldn't fall for another man if he were the biggest crook on earth ... Seventy-six, eighty-four, fifty-five--  What has she got that I haven't got?
Lily, you must listen to me.
Please, Madame Colet, I believe in doing things correctly. Shall we continue?  Two hairpins, one cigarette lighter, one box of real matches, and-- Oh, yes, this letter from Major--
That's too dark.
Do you realize I have light eyes?
But, madame, you keep a hundred thousand francs--in your safe--at <u>home</u>?
Tell me, M'sieu Laval, what else is wrong?
The same thing.
Like that?
But attractive--
<u>I</u> <u>love</u> <u>you</u>.
Yes, Gaston?
I wouldn't say anything--I would act.
You look beautiful.
Adolph J. Giron.
But it could have been glorious.
Oh, M'sieu Laval ...
Oh, that's too bad. You see, I wanted her to do something.  Well, I guess I'll have to do it myself.
He is my secretary! I hope that answers all your questions, M'sieu Giron.
That's true.
You should have more self-control. You were in the army.
Your bag?
Water 14 feet above the keel in ten minutes... in the forepeak... in all three holds... and in boiler room six.
Mr. Andrews, I did the sum in my head, and with the number of lifeboats times the capacity you mentioned... forgive me, but it seems that there are not enough for everyone aboard.
Bottom, left, right. I have it.
Who's the best? Say it.
Look, I'm running out of time. I need your help.
She's not on the starboard side either.
I was tired.
Something serious has happened.
What do I tell your mother?
There are boats on the other side that are allowing men in. Jack and I can get off safely. Both of us.
I'll be alright. Hurry up so we can get going... we got our own boat to catch.
Almost as good as you.
Oy, mate... that was a close shave.
No, but we're making excellent time.
Captain, the press knows the size of Titanic, let them marvel at her speed too. We must give them something new to print. And the maiden voyage of Titanic must make headlines!
So, you got a name by the way?
I don't... it wasn't just one thing. It was everything. It was them, it was their whole world. And I was trapped in it, like an insect in amber.  I just had to get away... just run and run and run... and then I was at the back rail and there was no more ship... even the Titanic wasn't big enough. Not enough to get away from them. And before I'd really though about it, I was over the rail. I was so furious. I'll show them. They'll be sorry!
Uh huh. They'll be sorry. 'Course you'll be dead.
Just some sketches.
I think you must have had a love affair with her...
I did, didn't I?  Look! A shooting star.
He's an ex-Pinkerton. Cal's father hired him to keep Cal out of trouble... to make sure he always got back to the hotel with his wallet and watch, after some crawl through the less reputable parts of town...
Where to, Miss?
Now it's worse.
Come with me, Jack. I jump, you jump... Right?
No... don't say your good-byes, Rose. Don't you give up. Don't do it.
I don't think I've ever seen such a flat calm, in 24 years at sea.
Yes, like a mill pond. Not a breath of wind.
Would you like anything?
It's so unfair.
It would be a nice change from you.
But, Anya, dear! Unless you play we won't have a fourth.
I'll join you later.
I can explain--
And when you do I'll convey your respects by wireless to Herbert.  Take it easy, Lee--no other woman'll ever get you. At least I'm honest when I tell you there must be something pretty low down in me--because I like you.  You're such a swine!
No--I'm furious!--Nobody seems to do anything about it--
You're Anya Rosson, aren't you? I've heard of you back in New York.
Montana?
Did you find it?
No!--Did <U>you</U> take that bracelet?
Lifted it out of a guy's cabin last night.
I should pass, but I'll trail along--I'll take three. 
In that case--you owe us exactly sixteen hundred dollars.
And I'll lay odds you got that bracelet.
I wouldn't miss this boat for a million.
I'll say she is!
So you washed it off!
Nothing to speak of. What is this--third degree?
You asked me to dine with you tonight.
Yes?
Mighty decent of you, pal.
Don't kid me. I'm in no mood for it.
Will you take some advice?  If you're looking for romance--count me out--  --if you know what's good for you.
What?--
How well do you know her?
A Mr. Summers and a man called Lother.
I'll change and be with you in ten minutes.
Seven-fifty. Positively my last offer.
We coulda got two third-class!
Quick, let me have that money. I'm broke and I'll need it for tips.
A dollar forty.
Come on--  I'll promote a card game, and we'll be sitting pretty.
My change.
Pleasure first if it don't interfere with business.
I fell in his arms--Couldn't resist it.
Your mother is feeling seasick and would like to see you right away.
That goes two ways.
Care to join us?
Sorry--but I'm on a vacation--
Thought you were going to turn in, Inspector.
You know what I'd do, if I were you--before the card game I'd go to the Purser's office.
Coming to the pool for a swim?
Nice girl, that--  I'd hate to see <U>her</U> get a raw deal.  You know, the great trouble with crooks is they're <U>too</U> smart. Now if I'd taken that bracelet, I'd find some way to slip it back--I'd know I could never get ashore with it.
No--I'm looking for Miss Marsh myself. I thought you might know where she is--
I don't know what it is, but I won't use it.  Is she entertaining you?
"Will be back in four weeks"--  --that saves you eighty cents right there!
Pretty good--thirty <U>miles</U> an hour--
Well, you got the first down--there's one more to go. Come on, we're ready to start right now. Come on. Just keep stiff.
I was never stiffer in my life.
Let me see now--Don't tell me--  You're dumber than me and I'm dumber than you. I don't get it.
He's a likable chap--he's got an honest face--
Maybe he just travels in bad company.
No--not much--excepting-- 
No--Inexperienced--  A red-headed kid--homemade clothes--Broadway was Paradise--and a slot at the Automat was a Banquet.
Do what--
Chad Denby broadcasting--  --the nicest man I ever knew--
But I'm not finished yet----And your waves are so colossal--rocking boats both to and fro--Oh-h, Atlantic, how I love you ----how I love you--
Oh yeah?--My personality put this thing over--
What's he got that I haven't got?
Oh, Mr. Denby, I wrote a poem about a bracelet--
What happened to you?
Out my way in Montana we always call a bluff. 
All right--but what is there to face? It's finished.
You ran away because you were afraid. I don't want it to end like that.
You didn't have a gun in your hand last night?
Say, "Thanks very much!"
Soon as I get that bracelet back I'm going to relax. Wish the guy that borrowed it would help me out--I got to win that fifty bucks.
I mean--a lot of gentlemen would be offended if you searched them like that.
You saw him sitting out there in front, didn't you?
I'll explain later--
Let me look at it.
I tell yuh I ain't got no bracelet--
Newcomers, eh?  Names John Behan, I'm Cochise County Sheriff.  Just Hit town?
Nice voice.
A peace officer... Impressive man
Well I guess you can see, never a Dull moment.  Maybe you should Stay around to see what happens Next.  Who know?  You might find a Future here.
I want them spitting blood!
Fair enough.  You know I got to Admit, you got a lot of bark on You comin' up here like this.
I'm sorry.  If there was any other-
No Marshal, you don't understand. I'm through with lawing, I'm Through with the whole Proposition.  Forever.  I did my Duty, now I'd like to get on with My life.  That is if you don't Mind.  Jesus.  Good day now.
Not me.  I'm in my prime.
Yeah, you look it.
Sheriff Behan, Doc Holliday.
So now we're in the mining Business.  Turning into regular Tycoons.  Gonna call this one the Mattie Blaylock.  Mattie'll get a Kick out of that, it's her maiden Name.
I see, well this happens to be a Nocturne.
Wyatt Earp is my friend.
I'm your man...  You win again.  Well played, sir. You are on fire.
Are you out of your mind?  What on Earth'd make us-
See how she breezed out of here. Like she had wings.  Funny thing But I can't really remember how She looked.  I can remember parts Of her clear as crystal, her Mouth, her walk, how she shut her Eyes when she laughed, little Bits and pieces, but not the Whole package.  Can't put it Together for some reason.
Good God, you're really-
Praise Jesus!
What is it?
Fun though, wasn't it?
Doesn't suit you.
Well I ought to know my own mind And I'm tellin' you what suits me Is a family and kids.  That suits Me right down to the ground.  In Fact, that's my idea of heaven.  All right, what's your idea of heaven?
You mean Behan?  Then why are you with him?
You feel bad about this?  About me?
I have to go.
Come up to the fire, honey.
Out ridin'.  So... how you doin'?
I ain't your brother, I ain't None of your damn brothers.  Move!
Well how do we look?
Maybe, yeah.  Hell, I don't know.
That thunder's sure somethin'.
Morgan, are you crazy?  They're Out gunning for us!  What the Hell're you doin'?
I am usin' it, Wyatt.  Been Wonderin' how the hell we got in This tangle.  You know they hit Clum's house, too?  Shot up his wife. His wife.  Who ever heard of That?  Men sneakin' around in the Dark, back-shootin', scarin' Women?  They're bugs, Wyatt.  You Know all your smart talk about Live and let live?  Ain't no live And let live with bugs.
Yeah.  It's a fact.
We should get moving.
Well we're off and running.  Just Acquired us a quarter-interest in The game at the Oriental.
Wait a minute, you thinkin' of Getting in bed with the Cowboys?
Getting late.  Guess I'll turn in.
... What were you saying, Admiral? Something about this 'not being a job for a wine-sniffing, skirt-chasing playboy spy?'
Excuse me, but -  I must formally protest this meeting. Given the nature of what's occurred - and the need for secrecy - I see no reason to involve the air force, the army, or MI-6.  This is an internal affair that should be handled strictly by the officers of her Majesty's Royal Navy.
I see.
I tried to save her. But she remained a manic depressive: Fits, inappropriate behavior... Delusions of grandeur.
You see, Mr. Bond, you and I are both men of action. But your era is passing. Words are the new weapons; satellites the new artillery. And make no mistake about it: In the right hands, they can be as deadly as your Walther PPK.
Next morning. Both boats. Nothing wrong.  My 90 year old grandfather thinks 'Ghost in the computer - Silicon Dragon.'
Actually, I've never known you to do either... But -
What - no lust for adventure?
Q! How are you?
Yes. And do try to keep all four of them on the road.  All the usual refinements: Smoke, missiles, machine guns -  Fully operational remote control. Drives forward, reverse -  Stop that!  Plus infrared thermal imaging radar, heads up instrumentation, and 17 beverage cup holders.
...That's all well and good, Captain, save for one thing:  There's no gold down there.
That's absurd! It took two squads of forty men fifteen days to load that gold.
Paris -
Perhaps. But it does explain how an ex-KGB agent turned illegal-arms dealer is suddenly portrayed as a long-time friend of the people.  If you believe what you read in the papers.
Hey - the world is my office.
I envy your 'undercover' assignments.
Do you have a pen? I just got promoted and don't have my new cards yet.
This afternoon. Our boats practically kissed in the harbor.  James Bond.
Vodka martini, shaken not stirred.  And another for you?
I'll keep that in mind.
And what do you call this?
Just remember: They think there's ten billion dollars in gold down there.
Blood or Dutch?
He was my father's best friend!
You are seriously deranged.
Not a lot of difference.
Here. You shoot. I'll drive.
If you think we're going to have some kind of 'life affirming' romance here just because we cheated death, let me be clear:  We're going to have it where I want, and when I want.
We've already done the interesting part. Do you forget?
Tsi tien, Mr. Bond.
Forget it. No way. I got here first.
Fifteen seconds. Perhaps you should consider hiring an attorney.
And the 9:30 news meeting is waiting.
Damn. It's doing it again.
It's Bond!
I regret to inform you, sir, that Saddam Hussein is still demanding a bonus for his role in the Gulf War.
I pay my own way.
Robert asks about you. When are you going to do something to help him?
Why in the hell didn't you help mama?
It was like all those things old country people try to tell you what hell is like.
Never play with someone's else's cards. You always get a new deck. Look at this card. See anything?
I could swear I heard my son call me.
My mind plays tricks on me. Is it okay if I take a bath now?
He ain't nothing like me. How come a man has to have sons that are day and night apart? You ought to stop protecting him.
Hush.
Well, it's up to Suzie.
Do you want your coat? It's cold out here.
No, I'm too hot now.
Just stay in bed and rest.
I'm almost finished. I'm about to come to the punch line.
Why didn't you catch a plane?
My feet have never been on anything that wasn't directly attached to the ground.
Man, act like this is your home.
Everything these days is made overseas.
You remember that boy who lost his mind, Joe? You could hear him pitching horseshoes at night in the dark. He wouldn't miss a one. Make him mad and call yourself running in the house to be safe. He would pick up a brick and say "go on in there brick and hit somebody" and it would find its mark.
What's the problem here?
How is he doing?
Now who are we talking about?
Those boys never did have good luck.
You damn right they didn't, especially Emory, my cousin.
How many people do you all feed?
Good God Almighty, bless your bones.  But the problem grows.
None of your business.
He should be caring. That is not too much to ask.
You don't want to be at crossroads without one. It's a charm that old people teach you how to make. I had one for a long time that belonged to my grandmother who had it ever since she was a child.  In my travels I misplaced it. I have been looking over my shoulder ever since.
I remember Harry always trying to help someone. He got Lulla's daughter out of trouble. He was always running to the store for someone who couldn't leave the house.
I can't accuse him just dry long 80.
Wow!  Cool!
Hey!  Wow!
You'd think they've never seen a new toy before.
Whoooooah!  Oh!  Bo!  There's gotta be a less painful way to get my attention.
Hello-o-o...
I need to repair my turbo boosters. Do you people still use fossil fuels, or have you discovered crystalic fusion?
No, you can't.
Can!
Can't!  Can't!  Can't!
I could have stopped him.
Oh.  Oh, that's good.
But we're not on my planet, are we?
Ow!  Watch where you're going!
C'mon, c'mon, that's it...
Get away!  Hoo-cha!  Hoo-cha!
I think you've had enough tea for today.  Let's get you out of here, Buzz.
Sh-h-h-h-h!!  Quiet, Buzz.
Hold on, Woody!
Woody!  The rocket!
No, no, not the ear.  Gimme the nose.  C'mon!
MOM!!  MOM!!
No!  No, no, no, no!
Hi ya, fellas.  To infinity and beyond!
It's too short!  We need more monkeys!
Finn -
Reprieve.
H'm?
Sixteen. Well, nearly sixteen.
Is she in any kind of therapy... professional help?
No, of course not.  She's one of the top students at her school.
Helena, I'm so sorry --
Why are you talking like that?
I don't know, but under no circumstances would I talk about it here.  I want you to go home and relax the best you can.  Continue your life as if nothing has happened. That is very important.
I am on the board of my son's school. I had a fundraiser for A.L.V. in my front yard.  I have a right to know if my husband is a legitimate businessman.
You're gonna get through it, but the first thing we do is get Michael Adler to represent Carl.  We get Adler and we beat this thing.
I need an introduction to the Obregon Brothers.
My Leica's gone.
What's it like?  Imagine you're being accosted by a swarm of beggars in the heart of Calcutta, except the beggars are wearing $1500 suits and they don't say "please" or "thank you."
What about legalizing everything? Has anybody talked about that?
What if every country legalized at the same time?
Sixteen
I'm third in my class.
I think so.  If she didn't she should have.  I've only got maybe an hour.  Then volleyball practice is over and I have to be home.
He won.  He was a winner.  That bothers you.
Your friends at Warren, Putnam and Hudson.
No --
One chance here, Eduardo.  Make us believe you got a boss.  No boss, it's all on you.
You're breaking my heart.
Bring this man a change of good clothes.  Has he eaten?
You don't?  Listen to this woman in a man's world, a very violent world.
Your new friends.
No, but a lot of other people.  You should come.  You should come out with us.
Madrigal's alive.
I'm trying to bust the Tijuana Cartel.
It could mean that, yes.
Any idea how much?
I'll pay you a thousand dollars.  I have it in my wallet.
I want your money, I'll take your money.
I don't know what to say.
I don't give a fuck about your parents --
Yes, I am confident that Juan Obregon will be taken into custody before the end of the year.  But, you must understand that it is very difficult because of corruption in the police force.  We get a tip that he is one place, then we get there and he is already gone, having been warned by someone on our side.
Let me ask you a related question. We've talked about the supply side, but what about demand?  What is your policy for treating addiction?
Salazar's been taken down.  He was working for Porfirio Madrigal.
Well, I've not brought them.
It's fucking boring after a while without the cards.
I'll be right after you.
I want the money, Mark, that's all.
No, I don't mean like that -- I mean something nice, like, that's all --
I'm no a fucking buftie and that's the end of it.
Jesus.
This was his nightmare. The dodgiest scam in a lifetime of dodgie scams being perpetrated with three of the most useless and unreliable fuck-ups in town. I knew what was going on in his mind: any trouble in London and he would dump us immediately, one way or another. He had to. If he got caught with a bagful of skag, on top of that armed robbery shit, he was going down for fifteen to twenty. Begbie was hard, but not so hard that he didn't shite it off twenty years in Saughton.
Great.
Christ, I haven't felt that good since Archie Gemmill scored against Holland in 1978.
Out.
No argument. You can sleep on the sofa in the living room, or go home. It's up to you.
Because it's illegal.
Is that a promise, then?
Calm down, I'm just asking. Is that hash I can smell?
You're too young.
And what age are you? Thirteen? Fourteen?
Exactly. I'm not wanting a cat, she says. Get to fuck, right. So there's Tommy stuck with this kitten. You can imagine what happened. The thing was neglected, pissing and shitting all over the place. Tommy was lying around fucked out of his eyeballs on smack or downers. He didn't know you could get toxoplasmosis from cat shit.
What do you mean, it's 'gone'? Where has it gone, Tommy?
Are you getting out much?
No.
Have you got any gear on you?
Thanks, Mark.
Goldfinger's better than Dr. No. Both of them are a lot better than Diamonds are Forever a judgement reflected in its relative poor showing at the box office, in which field, of course, Thunderball was a notable success.
Running time?
Yeah, Beautifully fucking illustrated.
Did he -- you know?
Fuck you.
Well, this guy I've met runs a hotel. Brother. Loads of contacts. Does a nice little sideline in punting British passports to foreigners. Get you a good price.
Are you serious?
I'm going to get it right this time. Going to get it set up and get off it for good.
you'll need one more hit.
Your usual table, sir?
Sure.
This had better be good.
There.
Six weeks and no sex?
Yes, but then she finds out I've bought a ticket for Iggy Pop the same night.
Mr. Murphy, {leaving your friend aside,} do you see yourself as having any weaknesses?
Um... yes. We've been caught in a blizzard!
Then it's fortunate that I have you and your starship to protect me. In the meantime, Captain Chekov, I instruct you and your First Officer to beam down to my coordinates.
I instruct you to surrender. You are under attack by Federation forces.
The Klingon, the Romulan, the Federation consuls. Now I know Enterprise is not exactly up to specs...
Where did you get this power?
Join my quest.
Head down that tunnel to the hydro vent and turn right. Then left at the blowscreen. You can't miss it.
She's got partial power, sir. I might be able to take two of you.
Bird of Prey bearing one zero five mark two.
Because it's there.
Life is not a dream.
At footspeed I estimate the journey to Paradise City at 1.2 hours.
You did too. Sybok couldn't possibly be your brother because I happen to know for a fact that you don't have a brother.
Spock... the booster rockets.
I must have your starship.
No! No reply. Remain on course.
What makes you think I won't turn us around?

Scotty, dear, he' not a madman.
It was not my intention to amuse you. These are serious charges. However, if you surrender now-
Sybok, you must surrender.
No. I will not.
Sybok - this is not the God of Sha Ka Ree - or any other God!
Sybok.
You invented Space Paranoids?
Dillinger?
I was wondering where you got that glow of good health.
I want to go to his place.
I don't think I'm cleared for this.
Ever since he got that Master Control Program set up, system's got more bugs than a bait store.
Well, you have to expect some static. Computers are just machines after all, they can't think...
Come on in...
Yeah...?
Meanwhile, he might find it.
Ed, I am so very disappointed in you.
The Pentagon?
You wouldn't want me to dig up Flynn's file and read it up on a VDT at the New York Times, would you?
Hah.
The name of my User, yeah. But how... ?
What's that?
Greetings, program...
You're alive!
PARAMUS... wonder what those initials stand for ...  ...probably Program Assist Routine -- well, it sounds like a lovely place.
Feel what? You okay?
Yes, and now you've got two renegade programs running all the hell over the system in a stolen simulation.
We'll get them, sir... These things take time.
You think we can make it there?
Can you cover me for an hour?
Where are you going?
Okay, Dad.
Yeah, right.
Uh huh.  And her little hormones are going like a fire alarm.  I				* say even money that physicist on				* the bike is boinkin' her.						*
Station wagon?
Yeah, and we do it twenty times a day.  Don't give me that crap. Just put on the taps.  Now.
Goddamnit, Harry.  This is our butts.  So your life is in the toilet.  So your wife is banging a used car salesman.  Sure it's humiliating.  But be a man here--
I can get 3 Marine Corps Harriers here in about 12 minutes. They're on maneuvers out of Boca Chica.
... well get the Highway Patrol to go through the streets and tell everybody on their damn loudspeakers.  Just the basics... get away from windows, don't look at it... yeah--
He's got it.
But you didn't.  Why not?
Is this a common thing for you? Cheating?
No!  Never!
Yes sir.
It's certainly... dramatic.
I was in the area, and I thought you might like to have lunch.
Do you still love your husband?
Yes or no.
So last night was pretty exciting, huh?
Sodium amytal, maybe some other truth agent.
17 years.
She's really a fox, isn't she?
Not yet.  But we'll find him.
Okay, just ask yourself.  What do women really want?  You take these bored housewives, married to the same guy for years.  Stuck in a rut.  They need some release.  The promise of adventure.  A hint of danger.  I create that for them.
Exactly.  The trick is, you gotta pick your target.  They have to be nice little housewife types. School-teachers.  But, I'm telling you, you get their pilot lit, these babes, they can suck- start a leaf-blower.
Now just keep your knees together, and you'll be fine.
Like one?
I kept looking back, like you taught me.  I didn't see anyone.
Yes.
It's just that... it's been sixteen years since anyone but Harry did that, I--
Did you get the letter?
Holy Mary, Mother of God.
You got that playing basketball?
Bye, Daddy! Hope to see you again real soon.
Tell him not to eat anything. We're gonna scarf when we get there.
Oh, look what happened. Oh god, I'm so sorry. Are you OK?
The oriental in black. He's an assasin. Now, at the beginning he was hired to kill this guy the cops had. So he got himself arrested. They take him into the police station. And he starts kickin' all the cops' asses. Now, while keepin' them at bay, he finds the guy he was supposed to kill. Does a number on him. Kicks the cops' asses some more. Kicks the bars out of the window. And jumps out into a getaway car that was waiting for him.
I thought Sonny was the good guy.
I took a cab.
'Bout twelve.
Would you like to get some pie?
Ask me them again. One by one.
I don't remember.
What kinda music do you like?
Phil Spector. Girl group stuff. You know, like "He's a Rebel".
What are your turn-ons?
Wow. What a swell place to work.
Yeah, I got the key, so I come here at night, hang out, read comic books, play music.
Four hundred bucks.
Oooooh, you look so cute in your little cowboy outfit. How old were you then?
So he really loved her?
I don't know. I didn't talk with them. The plan was for me to bump into you, pick you up, spend the night, and skip out after you fell asleep. I was gonna write you a note and say that this was my last day in America. That I was leaving on a plane this morning up to Ukraine to marry a rich millionaire, and thank you for making my last day in America my best day.
Who and what is a Drexl?
Is he nice?
Oh, you're speaking of my charming wife Mrs. Alabama Worley.
So I can go over there and pick up your things.
You were chillin', kind of creepy even. You totally fucked with his head. I'm gonna go grab dinner.
Really?
With a vengeance, I hated them.
Why Cancoon?
So you do eat pussy!
Then shoot 'em. Shoot 'em in the face. And feed that boy to the dogs.
I ain't tellin' ya nothin'. I'm just sayin' what I'd do.
I don't blame you.
Can you develop an ulcer in two minutes? Being cool is hard on your body.
Oh, and your line to Charles Atlas in there: "I'll take that gun", "You'll have to".
Get the fuck outta here!
Clarence sent a letter?
This shit can't be real.
Tell me.
Is he big league?
OK, call 'im up and arrange a meeting, so we can get through all the getting to know you stuff.
Where?
Shut up! First you come waltzing into my life after two years. You're married. You killed a guy.
Clarence.
How 'bout you go to the movies with me tonight?
Coco leaves. You see, they take the leaves and mash it down until it's kind of a paste -
Where's everybody else?
Elliot.
I don't know, Clarence, "Doctor Zhivago" is a pretty big movie.
Where'd you go?
I think there's a Seven-Up in there.
Go to the liquor store -  Where is there a liquor store around here?
I'm glad. Hopefully that will clear up the how-full-of-shit-I-am question you've been asking yourself. Now, we're gonna have a little Q and A, and, at the risk of sounding redundant, please make your answers genuine.  Want a Chesterfield?
I've seen him.
Could I have one of those Chesterfields now?
I'm me... I mean, that's me.
Could we try it now?
Dirty cops. We'll have to bring in internal affairs on this.
But a fuckin' baggie.
Or a supporting actor -
You're a fuckin' star! And you're gonna be playin' your little one-man show nightly for the next two fuckin' years for a captive audience -
'Course you'll wanna fuck her in the ass. Pussy just won't feed right anymore -
Krinkle, this is it. We got it, man. And it's all ours. I mean talk about fallin' into somethin'. You shoulda seen it, it was beautiful. Dimes is hittin' him from the left about being fucked in the ass by niggers, I'm hittin' him form the right about not likin' pussy anymore, finally he starts  cryin', and then it was all over -
You do.
You see what you get when you fuck wit me, white boy? You're gonna walk in my goddamn house, my house! Gonna come in here and tell me! Talkin' smack, in my house, in front of my employees. Shit! Your ass must be crazy.  I don't think that white boy's got good sense. Hey, Marty.  He must of thought it was white boy day. It ain't white boy day, is it?
Naw man, I don't be eatin' that shit.
Do you live here?
Naw, they ain't stayin' here. But, I know who you're talkin' about. They're stayin' at the Hollywood Holiday Inn.
No.
I understand.  There'd be no point.
He's drugged out of his mind!  He's completely zoned out.
You wouldn't understand.
I have to go.
Hiding?
What's wonderful about the air, James?
It's so clean.  No germs.
What?
No more drugs.  Please...
What will you do...when you find this...secret army?
Oh, Jesus, James!  You killed him!
I told you what I want.  Lock the door!
James, why don't we...?
The guy was a total fruitcake.
You were going to run out off gas on purpose, weren't you?
I'm..."mentally divergent".  I would love to believe that.
You disappeared!  One minute you were there, the next minute you were gone. Did you run through the woods?
It was?  I didn't...know.
I mean in my dream -- I didn't realize it was you.  Then...I woke up and I...I thought you were gone.
I know this place! ... This is my dream.
They may be looking for us, James.  Use this.  You can fix it in the Men's Room.
Right!  You're right.  I have to fix this.
Wooooo, they really dosed you, bro. Major load!  Listen up -- try and get it together.  Focus!  Focus!  The plan! Remember?  I did my part.
County Hospital, right?  1989.  The "Immaculate Escape" -- am I right?  Why, thank you -- you look wonderful, too.
I don't have time to go upstairs.  The police are looking for me.  I need to know where it is and exactly what it is.
Bulishit!  You're fucking with my head!
They gave you a pardon, man.  Whatdaya want?
Uh, that message...me?
I didn't think I was being defensive. I was just...
What...virus?
She knew about it, Jeffrey.  She knew you were going to try this.
What virus are we talking about, Dad?
-- so they get there and they ask the guy real nice for some kind of i.d., and he gets agitated, starts screaming about viruses. Totally irrational, totally disoriented, doesn't know where he is, what day it is, alla that stuff.  All they got was his name.  They figure he's stoned out of his mind, it's some kinda psychotic episode, so they're gonna bring him...
You want something, old man?
You can't do that yourself?
I think you'd better give your pooch a sip.  He looks sick.
That a fact?
Maybe one day I'll get to sit on a corner and spout wise.
No and I don't plan on sticking around either.  I don't guess I'll be seeing you again.  Take it easy.
Can I help you, sir?
Where to?
How much.
Twenty-seven, fifty.  That's all I got.
Doubt it.  He's dead.  The Look Out's a cemetery.
You want to take a look at my car? I think the radiator hose is--
I know it's busted.  What did I just tell you?
How much time?
What time is it now?
Yeah, right.  Someplace in this dust bowl I can get something to drink?
Just banged my head.  It was an accident.
You son of a bitch!
You think bad, and bad is what you get.
What?
Take it.  As soon as I get my money. Fifty dollars for an almost new gasket.  You don't know what kind of a deal you're getting.
I'm taking my car, and I'm taking it now!
I want my car.
Poor thing.  Is she all right?
Is that right?  Can't say as I blame you for wanting to head out for a bit.  I know I've had my fill of this town.  Sixteen years I've been the law and order here.  So long I forgot why I ever wanted the job in the first place.  Help people, I guess.  Keep the peace.  Problem is there's so much peace around here they don't much need me.  Got a lot of speeders, but they're speeding through miles of nothing so I can't hardly blame them.  Other than that, well, there ain't much to steal.  I reckon that the last big crime we had was, what would you say Mrs. McKenna?  A murder?
What do you want?
Who was that on the phone?
They look nice.
They look nice.
Maybe, but if you didn't I think you would have kept on walking.
It's nothing.  Really.
Yes, I have.
Somewhere else.  I've never been anywhere else.  Just once.  Years ago.  Went to the state fair.  It was nice, but it wasn't nothing.
Did you like it; me watching you?
I guess it must.
There.  All done.  Lift me down.
Games?
I think I can find my own way back to into town.
Doesn't the heat bother you?
You love him?
I can't.
Grace, I can't.  I can't even get out of here myself.  I need a hundred-fifty bucks to get my car back from that crazy mechanic.
Where?
Kill someone.  I can't do it.
I don't think we have anything to talk about.
Except I can't get you out of my head, Grace.
I've thought about you every second since I left.  I can still taste you on my lips.
You said you couldn't kill anybody.
Where are you going?
Had push it in.  Funny thing; it wouldn't start.
You killed him!
Now what?
Now we dump Jake, split the money, then you're on your own.
You closed it, didn't you, Grace?
Someone will find me.
Accident.
You've got to be--
Would you?
No.
Hungry?
I'm not rambling.
You're the one who brought it up. This morning.  In your car.
That was just loose talk.  I don't want anybody dead.
And for that you'd kill Grace?
For that I'd kill a nun on Easter Sunday.
What should I do?
I guess I have what you'd call a love-hate relationship with Grace.
You think that's a lot of money?
Yeah, well, me too.
You thought you'd come in here in the middle of the night and wham! Wail off and clock old Jake McKenna and turn his brains into wall paper.
Sense?  If I had any sense I would have killed you this morning and been done with it.
You'd tell me anything to save your pathetic life.
You like Patsy Cline?  I just love her.  How come, I wonder, she don't put out no more new records.
But you was going to fight for me.
You expect me to believe that?
You're fucked.
Christ, I don't believe this.
Fucking kid.  And look at you; breaking fucking pencils.  You're a Neanderthal.
Kids.
Thirty-thousand dollars.
Soda.  You got any soda?
What'd you think I was doing out here with these glasses on?  Sunnin' myself?
Don't forget to open it for me.  I can't be opening my own bottle.
What?
Who's cursed?
Christ, I don't believe this!
You idiot!  You don't even know what you're fighting over!
I'm leaving.  You never have to see me again.  Just please, give me the ticket!
Didn't much look like you were hanging drapes.
What the fuck do you want?
You a sailor man?  That'd be the life. Drive across the country, step on a boat and just sail away.  A man could pretty well disappear like that.  Just sail away until all he was was a memory.  I guess a little place like this would just be a dot on a map to you after awhile.
I hope so.  Listen, McKenna about your wife:  If I had known she was married--
Wait a second--
I've done a few things but I'm not a murderer, Mr. McKenna.
Talk?  About what?
And what does that make you?
Well, I guess I have what you call a love-hate relationship with Grace.
Oh yeah sure. Why don't I buy you a plane ticket right out of here while I'm at it. I <u>know you</u>...  This is what you do:  Go to the house to see her.
Hey mister. Mister, I just... I just wanted to thank you.
How old are you?
You're too late, Toby.  We're going to get in his fancy car and ride off and leave you behind.
You Harlin?
So?
You got to be more careful. Hands is important.  Let me show you something. When I was a kid, now I don't know if you can still see it, but I gashed my fingers in a lawnmower.
That's a Ford, not a Ferrari.  You going to tell me no one else in this shit hole drives a Ford?
It might as well be fifteen-hundred dollars, because I don't have the money.
That's a good piece of advice, Darrell.
The goddamn sign on the wall. I can't do unauthorized work?  What am I suppose to do? Just let you ride out of here with a bad gasket.  Then you get in an accident and get killed.  Or worse.  Who they gonna blame then?  They gonna blame me, and there goes my reputation.
What reputation?  You're nothing but an ignorant, inbred, tumbleweed hick.
I don't want no dirty money.  I run an honest business.
No.
I'm just going to my car?
You're welcome, Grace.
Where you coming from?
All over.  Chicago, Houston, Detroit.  Just lately Dallas.
I never played tennis. You just travel around Bobby-- no direction, no steady work.  You must like taking chances.
If you're going to gamble, might as well play for high stakes.
From my father.  He was the tribe's shaman.
Those are white words, not ours.
Like you.
Yeah, well I said I was an idiot. Whatta you say we get out of here, take a drive somewhere, talk...
I don't know how.
Grace, I've been fucked over too many times, by too many women.  You're becoming the queen of hot and cold.
You'd never understand.
Jake never gives me more'n twenty bucks at a time, like a bird in a cage, he don't want me goin' anywhere...
Jake hides it. In a safe. In the floor. In the bedroom. He counts it. He loves to sit there and count it.
It takes a key.  He keeps it on himself all the time.  I mean <u>all the time</u>.  It scratches up against me when we do it.
I mean it, Grace.  I'm getting out of here, and I want to take you with me.
Is that what changed your mind?  The money?
The money's right here! Get the key!
I ... nothing.  I just stubbed my toe on a rock.  Hurt like hell.
Hey!  Take it easy.  Want to get us killed?
Then will you take me on your friends' boat with you?
The only deal he had in mind was killing you for Jake's murder and blackmailing me into sucking his dick for the rest of my life... no thanks.
Don't you think I would've done it if I wanted to? What can I do to make you relax, baby?
Don't leave me. I want to say with you, Bobby.
<u>Jake</u>...
Where ya goin'?
That's a nasty cut you got there.
That's a shame, Bobby.  A real shame.
Right, Mr. Arkady. And that's not the half of it. I got your money, and I go into this little grocery store in this hicktown to get something to eat and then... well, it gets <u>robbed</u>!
Where to?
Out of here.
But, in particular?
How about Ciudad Juarez? You could take a local, arrives in two hours, and transfer in Albuquerque. It'll get you across the border.
No.  Just plain ol' Miller. Now you can fuckin' take it or you can fuckin' leave it.
You fuck this guy -- get him to do your dirty work and you think you can take the money and dump me?
You been a bad girl, Grace. You took my heart from your Mama, didn't ya? You betrayed her! Like you did me. There ain't no forgivin' ya, girl!
Yeah, I heard a key slapping against my ass.
I axed you a question.
Where's the fire sweetheart? Don't know how they work things in Nevada, but we got speed limits in this state.
I am Russian, da! I am also <u>rich</u> Russian, da? Maybe we work something out, my friend Sheriff?
Yes?
No sir he is not.  I read about you in the paper.
Proceed.
I don't know. It's been a while.
I've come to a decision.
He didn't do anything. He just told me his theory... It's sad when patients get like that. They loose reality.
My turn. What's your favorite song?
Soft and Wet, by the Artist Formerly Known as Prince.
I assumed because of the train.
You forgot the "Now I'm going to tell you what the hell is going on" step. See usually that comes before the, "It's over" Step. And it always, always comes before the "You can go" Step.  What is over?
What do you want?
Are you for real?
I don't know what you're asking?
Listen. I got to be on the sidelines during the game... You can get to your seat by taking the stairwell at--
I must have felt some lump in his back when I bumped him. Most guns have a black or silver handle. I had a fifty-fifty shot at the color.
He's doing well today.
He's kind of a miracle.
I won't make any noise.
Jeremy.  I'm going in. I have to do some things.
No.
That's great.
Don't be scared.
Any way, fate stepped in and took football out of the equation.
I own a comic book museum. It's called the Limited Edition.
...I got a present for you.
Where is it?
You... you ain't even gonna... whip 'em?
You told them cowboys you had it.
That Kid... he's just a... boy. And that other one, Bill, being true to his wife...
He didn't say nothin', huh?
Little Bill come out of Kansas an' Texas, boys. He worked them tough towns.
Oh. Yeah.
You're a beautiful woman an'... if I was to want a free one, I guess I'd want you more than them others. It ain't... See... I can't have no free one on account of my wife...
Little Bill, I thought you were dead. I see you shaved off your chin whiskers.
We got one of them fuckers, Sheriff, out by Cow Creek, we...
Those cowboys messin' him up?
I didn't hear nothin' till last night.
You know how women kin lie... I knock 'em around a little, ask 'em where the money is, they say they don't have none?... but they coulda squirreled away that much, the five of 'em. Maybe. 
Well, I guess they'll just up an' run anyhow, them two.
You're spillin' your whiskey, mister.
Uh... yeah. Yeah.
But he was called...
He will be hurryin' and he will miss. That there is as fast as I can pull an' aim an' hit anythin' more'n ten feet away... unless it's a barn.
About where you an' him  was... an' where you was from... an' what your names was... an'...
Maybe I ain't.
Well, now Kid, there's two of these cowboys, ain't that so? Better there's three of us... maybe them cowboys got friends. Maybe...
No.
They takin' water?
Is it him?
I can't see 'em.
Take a drink, Kid.
It's a hell of a thing, ain't it, killin' a man. You take everythin' he's got... an' everythin' he's ever gonna have...
You could have it. All of it.
I thought you wanted to buy spectacles an' fancy clothes an' all.
You sure you ain't armed?
I was lucky in the order.  I always been lucky killin' folks.
We ain't bad men no more, Bill. Hell, we're farmers.
Cut up a woman. Cut her eyes out, cut her tits off, cut her fingers off... done everythin' but cut up her cunny, I guess.
How long you gonna be, Bill?
It's just... she's a Indian an' Indians ain't... overfriendly.
HEY.
Yeah... you said that last night.
The angel... the angel of death. I'm scared, Ned. Ned, I'm gonna die.
Three.
Did I what?
Yeah?
I don't like the question.
Depends what he told you.  About Bill, you mean?
What was the money for?
I don't get it.
&lt;&lt;Are you sure?&gt;&gt;
Now remember, this is another kind of business. They don't earn your respect. You owe it to them. Don't stare them down but don't look away either. Confidence. They are fools not to trust you. That's the attitude.
...and the desk Sergeant is actually trying to tell me he can't release you? Can you believe that? You weren't even charged. New York police - Jesus. I want to take pictures of your face to bring to the D.A. first thing in the morning.
Give me some credit. I got you this far, let's go to the grand jury. This is never going to stop if we -
It was the Feds. A truck load of guns gets snagged, Customs comes down on N.Y.P.D. for some answers - they come up with us. They're grabbing at straws. It's politics - nothing you can do.
You are a criminal.
It's a logistical nightmare. Close quarters, no advance layout, ten men, maybe twenty.
How do you do?
Tough break.
McManus wants to go in shooting. I said no way.
They're pretty pissed off. They'll do anything. Now I got a way to do it without killing anyone: but like I said, they won't let me in without you.
What if I
You set up the line-up.
The answer is no.
We know you can get to us, and now you know we can get to you. I'm offering you the chance to call this off.
Take your time. Enjoy L.A.
A friend of mine in New York tells me you knew Spook Hollis.
Who is he?
I know what I wanted to know about Keaton.
A rumor is not a rumor that doesn't die.
Sure. Fifteen years ago, but he was a good thief Anyway, the cops wouldn't let him go legit.
There's nothing in there about Ruby.
The first thing I learned on the job, know what it was? How to spot a murderer. Let's say you arrest three guys for the same killing. Put them all in jail overnight. The next morning, whoever is sleeping is your man. If you're guilty, you know you're caught, you get some rest - let your guard down, you follow?
You got him wrong.
The D.A. gave me immunity.
So why play into his hands? We can protect you.
Give a guy a break, huh?
McManus was furious. He was talking about tracking him down and ripping his heart out and all sorts of shit. That night we got the call.
But Keaton had. Edie Finneran was his extradition advisor. She knew who he was and what he knew.
I don't buy that reform story for a minute. And even if I did, I certainly don't believe he would send you to protect her. So why?
Edie...
The district attorney's office will comply provided -
No provisions, nothing. My clients testimony for his immunity.
Why did he go to see Mary Rooney?
Neither does he.  That's where he loses.  This man's scared to death to go to court.  We only have to call his bluff.
How did you settle on the amount?
You know what that would mean?  To get somebody from a Boston hospital to say he'll testify?
That's the call that I'm waiting for.
No, actually, she was referred to me.  She was Dr. Hagman's patient...
`Code Blue,' what does that mean...?
She'd aspirated vomitus into her mask...
...and her heart stopped and she wasn't getting oxygen.
And what did your team do...
...We did everything we could...
My God, we tried to save her...You can't know...You can't know...
What book is that?
I am seventy-four years old.
The document is disallowed, the jury will be advised not to consider the testimony of Kathy Costello regarding the Xerox form.    It's unsubstantiated and we  can't accept a copy in preference to the original...
I . . ..
Yes, I, yes, I signed it, yes. But I, I didn't write that figure.
I am on the staff of...
'Code Blue'...
...I made a reservation at...
Dr. Thompson.  From your review of the hospital records of May twelfth nineteen seventy-six.  In your opinion, what happened to Deborah Ann Kaye?
Cardiac arrest.  During delivery her heart stopped.  When the heart stops the brain's deprived of oxygen.  You get brain damage. That is why she's in the state she's in today.
I'm afraid that's not true.   Will you want me to stay on till Monday?
Dr. Gruber ...
Yes.
Who put my client in the hospital for life.
I'm sure it is, Frank:  and let me tell you something.  If we find it so complex, how in the hell you think you're going to make a jury understand it?   See my point?  Let's talk a minute. Frank: what will you and your client take right now this very minute to walk out of here and let this damn thing drop?
I wasn't disbarred, they dropped the pro...
And it seems to me, a fella's trying to come back, he'd take this settlement, and get a record for himself.    I myself would take it and run like a thief.
I need an extension for my case.
Is the Plaintiff ready?
I'm an attorney on trial before the bar.  Representing my client. My client, do you understand?  You open your mouth and you're losing my case for me.
Exception!
Continental Casualty...
Mr. Galvin's...
Missus...
I changed my room at the Hotel.
A brick house says you divorced him.  I'll put you on your honor. Bet you a hundred dollars against you join me for dinner.  And I'll take your word for it.  Now you tell me the truth.  Because you cannot lie to me.  What's your name?
Maybe what?
Would you like me to leave...?   Is this a bad time --?
Why don't you get some rest?
Isn't there something you...
You told me so.  Maybe you'd get some sympathy.  You came to the wrong place.
You're like a kid, you're coming in here like it's Saturday night, you want me to say that you've got a fever -- you don't have to go to school...
You, you don't under...
Oh, yes, I do, Joe.  Believe me. You say you're going to lose.  Is it my fault?  Listen!  The damned case doesn't start until tomorrow and already it's over for you!
It's over!
What is that to you...?
What are you going to do?
No, no, no.  I have to talk to him.  If I can only call him..
One lousy letter eighteen months ago. . . .I try to throw a fuckin' case your way ...
I know what I said but not now. You won it.  Franky.  You won it. When they give you the money, that means that you won.  We don't want to go to court -- is this getting to you...?  You know who the attorney is for the Archdiocese, Eddie Concannon.
Frank, but not now.  Frank.  You're trying to wipe out some old business.  But not now.  I understand.  But you go call 'em back.  You call the Bishop back.
You got the admittance form says patient ate nine hours prior to admittance.
No.
Today is Tuesday.  What?
That's right.
Who?  They're all testifying. Everybody who was in the O.R.'s going to take the stand.
She didn't do anything.  She took the patient's history and signed the charts.  'K.C.'  'Kathy Costello...'
The broad has disappeared...
...yeah...good...
We got a mistrial, you know.  Joe -- did you hear what I said...?
I'm ... Mrs. Doneghy?  I'm Frank Galvin ... why didn't you go in?
... I'm sure you do ...
Yes.  Yes, I have.
I've been meaning to come in a long time.
I did.
It's a long road that has no turning.
...there are notations every thirty seconds...
...they start again three minutes earlier...
What happened in those three...
Interesting business.
Then?
From whom?
That's Carlotta Valdes.
Well, that explains it. Anyone could develop an obsession for the past, with a background like that.
How do you know all these things she doesn't know?
-- and how you happen to be living here.
About three years.
Well, I feel I owe you something for all this...
Just dinner.
Tomorrow morning.
Don't go.
I'll take care of you.
As friends? We'd just see a lot of each other as friends, and you'd "take care of me"?
Yes.
Why?  Because I remind you of someone?  That's not very complimentary.  And nothing would... happen...
Will you, Judy?
I like that one.
Scottie, what are you doing?
You want me to dress like her?
Judy, I want to tell you: these few days have been the first happy days I've had in a year.
Ah, no!
Well?
Come here.
I've got it.  He bends down and bites the back of her neck.
Scottie, why are we here?
No!
Oh, Judy!! When he had all her money, and the freedom and the power...  he ditched you? What a shame! But he knew he was safe. You couldn't talk. Didn't he give you anything?
...Old Port Point!  Out at the Presidio! Of course I remember! I often go there!
Please drink your coffee.
Lucky for me you were wandering about. Thank you again. I've been terrible bother to you.
No, I wouldn't like that. And after what happened today I should think you could call me Scottie. Or even John.
I... suddenly felt such a fool.
Well... anywhere in particular?
Oh... some, two thousand years, or more.
Of all the people who have been born... and have died... while the trees went on living.
No birds live here.
Where are you now?
No.
It was the tower again... and the bell, and the old Spanish village...
Let me go! Let me go!!
Yes.
What is her name?
Does she sleep here? Ever?
It's this darned corset. It binds. He retrieves the stick.
What do you mean?
And sit behind a desk?  Chairborne?
Nothing for a while. You forget, I'm a man of independent means. Or fairly independent.
From that music.
You know there's only one man in the world for me, Johnny-O.
Three whole weeks.
Out!
Around.
How?
No, that's not it. Nothing like it.
She'll be out in a moment.
How soon can it be altered?
We were playing...she slipped...she hit her head.
The hell I don't.
You have acquaintances - business friends and superficial golf buddies. You have always been a fringe player. You have some serious male on male intimacy problems.
If you ever touch my minivan again, I'll make you sorry. Real sorry.
You can't keep bringing up Starbucks. That was your only real hit in like 75 tries.
Everybody shut up. LISTEN TO ME!
Listen to me. Please. Everybody just calm down a bit here. Okay... First...are we sure she's dead?
We have a dead woman bleeding all over the bathroom. What options? Call the police.
That is not an "option." There is no multiple choice here.
So that's what we're doing.
We are all going straight to hell. Either hell or prison, whichever comes first.
Oh I did? I think it was your little rat fuck brother who decided to play Hamburger Helper with the hooker's head.
Don't talk to me about character.
Who? What are you talking about?
Honey, go in there and get some Starbursts.
We'll be ready Adam.
What.
Yup.
That's right.
Keith Richards, Dean Martin...
Call 911.
Take care of business.
I'm talking about Lois having relaxed her anxiety. Only deal is...you still got Micheal there?
Good deal. Lois just wants to hear it from Micheal.
I'm getting really tired of your bullshit.
You hate women.
If I'm the king of Israel, I say to myself, King, I say to myself, King... Take a good look around. What do I see?
I say to myself, look at the map. Look what's all around you. People who wish bad bad things for you and your people. For thousands of years the Jews are fighting everybody. It used to be they'd throw rocks, then the iron revolution and they would attack with spears. Then the gunpowder revolution. Now they're shooting fire power back and forth, all day bullets flying, babies getting shot.
The Israelis can protect themselves. They got the Mossad thing happening. Mossad's for real, man. They scalp babies.
This is going to stop right now. Right now!
Okay Micheal, let's go.  Upsy daisy big guy.
What?
Government cutbacks.
Florist?
Why did you forget the tent check?
You know how important this is to my mother. You know that.
I bet you didn't forget the bachelor party checks.
I asked you to marry me. I'm ready for marriage. That's responsibility. That's growth.
I just think that at some point you're going to have to re-evaluate some of your friendships...
He's weird. And I expect more from you.
That's absurd.
Do you love me?
We're leaving in three hours.
Will you please call the chair people?
Well I do.
We're on our way home. I just...we're running a little late.
No. Just like an hour or so.
Okay.
Lois is a mess and Micheal's really upset. Everyone's upset.
Oh God. We. Liz. We. We. Killed a woman. We...
What are you talking about?
My God. You've got to call the police, tell them it was an accident. Where is she?
Like how?
You put him down or don't bother coming back.
I'm just so scared of that song. That fucking, "My son just arrived the other day...he says thanks for the ball, come on let's play. I got lots of bills come again next day. He's grown up just like me...My boy is just like me." Gordon fucking Lightfoot, Cat Stevens, whoever, that song just fucking kills me.
It means she's insecure.
The wahoo moment?
The first day.
Did she believe you?
Greenpeace.
Did he try to kiss you?
I guess.
I'm saying it's luck. All luck. You work your entire life, all the training, focus, all the dedication, all irrelevant. Where does the ball bounce? My father spent his whole life trying to start a company, practiced every day, worked like a dog, finally got enough money. He's paid the dues, he's ready, does all the market research, picks his shot - "Pup Corn."
Well that ought to be about the end of that.
We don't say "love, honor and obey" anymore. And we don't say "till death do us part." Today we say, "respect, honor and cherish, as long as you both do love." How does that sound?
Liz do you take Fisher to be your beloved husband, to respect, honor and cherish him till death do you part?
Stop this, stop this.
Was that difficult to get?
Evil.
Unfortunately ...
It's my fault. If I'd come to see you more often, if I'd invited you here for holidays, maybe everything would be different.
Think about it. Don't hurry. Think it over.
All that I said just now was a lie. I said it so you wouldn't leave. I only molested you in my thoughts ... I can't bear to have you leave me, hating me like this.  Tell me you believe what I'm saying and I'll let you go.
Sit down, I'm going to need your help.
Is it all right?
That's it.
The fields have been left so long; with a good manuring anything will grow.
Nothing.
Shouldn't I be? You, on the other hand ...
But you have a right to let us know what you think.
What are you doing here? Get out.
Do they worry you that much, then?
It's for people!
They're varicose veins, miss, but some days I can't take care of them.
Are you sure it isn't contagious?
Why not?
A black bull came.
What's going on, Moncho?
Good morning. You weren't expecting me, were you?
I had so many things to think about!
Is there some grave impediment which prevents you from taking your vows? There must be something.
Ask the priest, miss.
What happened to me?
Hello.
I'm going to the hen house. Are you coming with me?
I've discovered something about Lindenmeyer'5 Maestro teaching tool I thought you should know...  The harm done to the music students who used the device  it was not by accident. The machine was designed explicitly for that purpose. Lindenmeyer intended to hurt the kids using it.
We don't know how, but Sid 6.7 made himself into an android.
What are they doing in Los Feliz?
I don't know.
You know those cheesy Christmas cards of your family under that tree in your back yard you keep sending me every year?
Their weapons missing?
Don't worry, they have no idea where you are.
On my life, I promise you I will.
Any sign of Lindenmeyer?
We have an emergency situation which requires somebody with expertise in criminal psychology. Under the authority vested in me by the President, I'm giving you temporary reassignment.
Letting a lunatic like Parker Barnes loose in the free world is like lighting a fuse. At some point, he will go off -- you saw what happened in the simulator. The risk to the public is unacceptably dangerous.
The man played judge, jury, and executioner with eight people's lives. He lost control and is capable of doing it again.
It's already been called off. Witnesses confirmed you weren't the shooter.  Did you find out where the bomb is?
What did Cox pull him out early for?
How does he know who I am?
I haven't been working on anything.
Do I get to see it or not?
How should I know?
He's developing a hemisphere imbalance.
If I don't adjust the level of neural information each side of his brain is receiving, he won't be able to walk when I take him out of VR.
SID  NO!!!
That's not true, Parker.
For murder, though it have no tongue, will speak with most miraculous organ.
Who said that?
Hamlet.  What's David Berkowitz got to do with Sid 6.7?
Dahmer carried the head of one of his victims in a bowling bag for over a week. Kept it in his locker while he was at work in a candy factory.  We need to get a look at Sid 6.7's final profile.
What we need to do is stop playing with computers and go catch the sonof-a-bitch before he kills anybody else.
I prefer keeping my professional life separate from my personal life.
What does that mean?
Whatever he was doing here was only the start.
He didn't know about the neural toxin.  I did.
You're not capable of it.
You mean there's something you haven't asked me?
Sid?
Then shoot him already.
What do we do now?
Now, is that any way to talk to an old buddy? I mean, just because I'm carrying around the joy of killing your family inside me doesn't mean we can't be friends.
Do they have to look so...robotic?
What are you saying...
...can we have a white one...?
...this is a snappy song....
You can't tell this story.  He's not kidding you.  You can't tell this story.  <u>You</u> knew that.  The pay off was, you get to be Ambassador, or...
You're not <u>thinking</u> right, Pal...
Who's got the story? 
Don't you want to know if it's true?
Front page.  Washington Post.  Tomorrow.
It won't hold.
We're going to have to explain away the...
Car and a driver, Mr. Brean, the Westgate, Now, please...
Tell, tell, tell me again.
<u>Who</u>?
...<u>nothing</u>...
It's like that thing with the Yellow Ribbon...
The Hostages...?
...can we see the Kitten...?
Yes.  That's true.  But...
Eight Days To Go 
Gimme the weather for tomorrow morning, five A.M. Andrews...
No rain.
...this is magnificent.
You missed your <u>plane</u>?  My <u>life</u> is over.  My <u>life</u> is over.  What have you <u>done</u> to me?  What have I done?  Fourteen years of Public Service...
...fourteen years...
And I'd like to point out that I've been on prescription <u>medication</u>, the side-effects of which...
Stanley, you can't do this....
ON SCHUMANN, WHO HAS CONE TO THE BACK OF THE COUNTER, AND IS EMPTYING THE CANNISTERS.
ON MOSS, AS HE WALKS THE GROGGY SCHUMANN TOWARD THE GAS STATION.
Well, let's not be too sure, why is that?
Hello...?
This ain't the illegal immigrant Nanny.
I'm a Jew in Show Business.  Why come to me?

...we get our hands on him?
Well, yes, but the guy <u>did</u> bring Peace.
Yeah, we'll gettem in their cars.  I'm slowing down...  No, no.  Look, lookit:  I think it's a mistake, well, I'll <u>tell</u> you why:  you got'em by the balls, <u>Squeeze</u>.

No, no, put him on.  Put him on.  President wants to reveal Scbumann before the election.
Hell, yes, we're, we're on our way to get him now.  No. Lookit:  it's like a girl with her virginity, y'understand...
Hey, lcokit:  <u>any</u> business...
I got it in the inaugural.  "Thank you for voting for me, but, <u>as</u> importantly:  Thank you for <u>voting</u>... 
The Albanian Campaign.

He's supposed to be flying in from Europe.
He raped a <u>Nun</u>...
Going to make a little stop back home, pick up my shirts, show him a little treat.
Isn't Johnny Green in the... 
What would be true, then.
...this is nothing.  This is nothing. D'you ever shoot in <u>Italy</u>?  Try three Italian starlets on Benzedrine, this is a walk in the park...
SUSIE...?  Are you alright...?
Look Harold, they're vulnerable, alright, but we don't want 'em to think they're under accumulation. Go slow. Call Geneva and the Bahamas for me, will ya? We feint towards it but we wait...
What about tipping off Yurovich?
Fox says Bluestar just hit 23. What do you want him to do?
Grand Marnier.
It's a romantic and tragic drink.
Nice piece of work, Fox. Why don't you join me and the partners for lunch tomorrow in the dining room?
...takes years of genetics, pal, and a Yale education... and the right tailor.
Buddy, buddy, some buddy; why didn't you tell me to buy Bluestar.
What's going on?
Hey you hear the news. I just got a job at a new firm: "Dewey, Cheat 'em and Howe." Yuk yuk.
You know what you need, buddy buddy--an optorectomy. That's when they cut the nerve that runs from your brain to your rectum--to change that shitty attitude of yours.
...leave me alone willya. Only thing makes me feel good anymore. Spaghetti. She makes lousy spaghetti...
I don't get it, you get a scholarship to NYU, you get 35,000 the first year, and 50 last year, where the hell is it?
...Got a 100 on me, you...
Alright. Why so pissed?
...don't be crazy. Put it to your school loans.
Problem with money is you never have enough or you got too much -- and when you got it you're never happy 'cause somebody's always trying to take it away from you. Money's one giant pain in the ass y'ask me... thanks.
Your responsibility, Dad, is to present the facts, not your opinions, to the men... you're gonna destroy their lives, Dad! Don't do it to 'em. Give it a chance. Let the membership decide for themselves, Dad. Please.
Hello, Natalie, you recognize the voice? I'll give you a hint, you're thinking seriously about marrying me...
...And you're even lovelier than I pictured. I brought a birthday present for Mr. Gekko.
...this guy who said he was from the Security Exchange Commission, whatever the hell that is, calls and wants to ask me about that stock I bought...
I don't know anything!
Hello Bud, I'm Lisa, a friend of Gordon's.
Lisa. Gordon? Oh, Mr. Gekko. Sure. Would you, uh, like to come in?
What was that?
"What are you thinking?"...that was it. The hours are hell, but the money's starting to tumble in. I know this guy who's got an iron- clad way to make money, I can't lose and I can't get hurt.
Yeah, right...
Alright... I just wanna slow down Bud... no more calls for awhile, no lunches... we suspend our business, alright...
I just want to let you know Mr. Gekko I read all about you at NYU Business, and I think you're an incredible genius and I've always dreamed of only one thing -- to do business with a man like you...
...for my kid Rudy -- 3 years old, electronics freak, got a liquid crystal display 'stead of an electronic beam. We're going into a new age pal. So how's business today.
I guess your father's not a union representative on that company.
Revenge is a dish best served cold... well, it's payback time, sport.  ... see that building? I bought into it ten years ago. It was my first real estate deal. I sold it a couple of years later and made an $800,000 dollar profit. It was better than sex. At that time I thought that was all tne money in the world...  Now, it's a day's pay ... I had a mole in Wildman's employ. Gave me half the picture, then he got fired...
I got all I could get which was 750,000 shares plus 5000 March 50 calls. Average price of $47 a share And $4 per contract for the call. I just wish I could've got more.
You don't understand. I want to be surprised...astonish me, sport, new info, don't care where or how you get it, just get it... My wife tells me you put a move on Darien. Here's some inside info for you. That Euroflash GQ guy she's going with's got big bucks but he's putting her feet to sleep. Exit visas are imminent. So don't lose your place in line.  Oh, jeez, I wish you could see this. The lights coming up over the water. I've never seen a painting that captures the beauty of the ocean at this moment.  ...an old Russian proverb - "a fisherman always sees another fisherman from afar." I like you sport, I ever tell you that... Gordon, call me Gordon from now on.
Gordon what I want--and I never asked you for anything--is to be your co-pilot on this. I want to take this airline, turn it around, and make it work. It's gonna make us a fortune!
What makes you think you can?
I can talk to these people Gordon, they trust me...and my father can be a big help in getting cuts.
Now, wait a minute, Dad...
Maybe you ought to read him Pinocchio. You told me you were going to turn Bluestar around. Not upside down. You used me.
How much is enough Gordon?
I'd give anything to have this in my house, even for a week.
Sure you could, in Wildwood, New Jersey. If you sold this,  you could have a pretty nice penthouse on Fifth. But you wouldn't have much left over for decoration.
Well, if you're that good, you could probably do wonders at my place.
Where is it?
I'll bet he's got an opinion on the stock market too. This apartment is already ahead of its time. I call it the "demolished" look. They've already heard about it at House and Garden and they're coming next week to photograph it before it gets... lived in. Is that alright? I'd love to have it in my portfolio.
So did I, till I hit 19 and found I had all the royal habits and no throne. Mom got by but I had to go to work just like you. Only the skills I had were shopping and making friends. So...that's why I do what I do, what makes you tick, Buddy?
I can stay with the brokerage firm. And you're doing fine. We can survive without Gordon Gekko.
I'm not looking to just survive. I've been doing that all my life.
You really mean that?  What'd he promise you? To take you public? I guess without Gordon's money and seal of approval, I'm not such a hot investment anymore. You're just the best money can buy, Darien...
Why?
Morning Buddy, you look happy.
I want to ask you a big favor, Gordon. Please drop the Bluestar deal.
He still likes you
What's that?
And uh, your nicotine sir
No?
A party at a waxwork huh?
What?  Tony and China, together?
No, no James, it's not like that.  Tony and China, they're just friends.
You don't understand.  I recognized his face now come on.
If my mother caught me up here she'd kill me.
Well, it all started when a friend and I
Guys, if I'm going to play the hero at least give me a little room.
Sir Wilfred, this is Sarah Brighton.  This is Sir Wilfred.
They're all human beings
Oh really?  We're they `us'es' or `them's'?
Save it for the powder room babe, this man is in pain
Do you have a scarf?
I think playing in a band called "Bitch" might put a dent in the whole "perfect family" thing.
Why is he worried?
These are good.
How do you know it's a she?
Whether you imagined it or not, you actually saw and heard things that frightened you...that gave you reason for concern.
Isn't there something called group hysteria?
I'm running late here.  I just came back for my briefcase.
Right.  Well, I wanted to stop by to welcome you to the uh, to the neighborhood.  I'm Claire Spencer.  From next door.
Well maybe your wife...
When...when will she be back?
I don't know.
You must think I'm pathetic.
You are?
Well good.  So you're human.
Oh my god.  You bought it.
Know what I think?
Someone's there.
Wow.  I'm losing it.
Sit down here.
And he's the real thing.  Specializes in cases like this, like yours.
I don't know.
If she was dangerous before--
But he acted like he'd never heard of it.
Genetic repair mechanisms in eukaryotic organisms.
Fine.
And we moved out here for the quiet.
Remember how we were?
...when tonight they'll probably be keeping us awake.
But what if something happens?
What kind of whispering?
"...especially Spencer's Theorem..."
Our house.
It's a flare.
Restaurant.  Let them know we're running late.
...I'm positive this time...
Claire, please don't...
THAT'S NOT TRUE!  You wanted to quit!  And then when you did, you hated me for it... so you gave it all to her.
She did it.
How can you be sure?
Adamant.
What?
Don't I, Norman?  YOU KEPT THE FUCKING NECKLACE.  Of a woman you killed!
But it doesn't make sense.  They - they used Lasher...  they conspired with him.
Don't tell Rowan about this.
Rowan - I'm Beatrice Maytair.  Your cousin.  Deedee...you'r mother and I - we - we grew up together.
You two sees like a perfect fit.   Only two mounths...?
Always give the crovd a taste, darling.  Now - Ryan said I'm supposed to make sure -
E11ie - Diedre died at five o'clock this morning.    Obviously, there are 1egal matters.  Your discretion will be -
When is the funeral...?   I am coming to my mother's funeral!!
I'm tired.  I need to rest.
And that is why I pushed your grandmother onto the stones - even as she had him inside her...
The door, Michael.  find the key...
Michael...  Do what you can.
FAST.
Lie...?
I am with you, my love. Like no other can ever be.
It is from love.
You're very clever, aren't you...?
Wrong...?  Science is not magic.
There was no thought.  There was no act.    That is not what I am.
Yessss...
They like you ------- kids.
I don't remember you at all-  You - you saved my life-  Bizarre thing to say, isn't it...?
You're not gonna give me the textbook analysia, are you doctor...? My vision was just the chemical reaction of an oxygen-starved brain - and nobody -
HARDER!
My mother and I used to take long walks and make up stories about the houses and the people who lived inside.  The Queen's house-. the Gangster's house-. the clown's house- Like that.
Doctor's orders- - -?

I'm wondering why the hell he hasn't shown up.
Ro, how long have we known each other.
Maybe the shrimp you bad last night.
You alright...?
Hi.    You - you wanna get some breakfast...?  Maybe see a movie...?
Go home, Stu  I'll call you.
We'd better get to work on the papers.
Which do you think is her best shot...
I heard something like that
Sounds good - thank you
CHIC MAGAZINE?
That's right...
I shouldn't say this - but you really remind me of someone I know
Do you take sugar?
Is 'their' colour an expression of their inner self? By that I mean, extroverts wear bright colours - so what are people who wear white?
I don't think so...This isn't a game you know...There aren't points or leagues. Sure I killed my husband - but I am no killer.
And how did it feel to be rid of him
My mother...?  I never knew my real MOTHER - I was adopted
No...I didn't do it...I wish I had but I didn't. I was beaten to it. STEPHANIE became my mother.
Psychiatrists would say that you are confronting your demons
What's wrong?
What's wrong?
But ELLEN, I told you I have stopped...
First finish your tea...
I'm sorry, I couldn't - when is she due?
What's wrong with you?
What?
Don't do it, Ted. Don't do it.
Seriously, it's like we're being reborn. We really could reinvent ourselves here, just like you said. Nobody knows about your massive humiliation.
This isn't some 80's porno film, you dip shit. There are no wild sex orgies.
It's a lot to digest. Imagine how you'd feel.
And while you're at it, I'll take ten dozen of those puppies with the springy heads.
Wouldn't it be awesome if we were about to say the exact same thing?
From your lips, to God's ears.
You go first.
Ted, have you lost your mind?
But that smile.
I remember the first time you walked into Mrs. Temple's class in 2nd grade. Blue gingham dress. Blond ponytail.
You expect me to think at a time like this? There isn't a drop of blood in my brain.
We're not ashamed of you, Teddy. We don't approve of the magazine or the models or the so-called "flesh parties" you attend. But we can get past all that.
The lesson being?
You guys are my parents.
Think of it as a rite of passage to manhood.
It's okay. You need me?
I don't have much experience with a...uh...stick.
I don't even know if I should be doing this. It's a very expensive car.
Some of them have to be automatics.
Hmmm?
Can you believe that was me?
No problem, consider it done.  I had this idea of shooting on location. Outdoors, you know? Maybe at some famous Xenia landmarks. You think that would be a problem?
Your parents would be crushed to think you weren't happy with it.
How are the hometown folks treating you, back in Xenia?
Mom and Dad said it's yours. They seem to think you're coming home.
I didn't forget.
I have absolutely no intention--
A few billion bucks and suddenly he's Cro-Magnon Man of the Year.
Come on, Julie. Don't screw up. You have some real talent.
Funny you should say "peachy."
I doubt it.
Then you'll see who's really holding on to you.
You're amazing.
Even when you infuriate me, I still want to kiss you.
I have a bit of a goosebump fetish. Not many people know that.
Shoes, if you want to know the truth. Shoes are my thing.
I'm very aural.
I see.
I had a Portuguese boyfriend who could read the phone book and melt me.
Turned out to be a scoundrel, eh? I saw that one coming.
You're quick. I like that.
Everything is lovely, Ted, but much too expensive.
Only the best for my mother.
That's a good start, yes. A very good start.
We don't allow TIPN, Ted.
The Supreme Sovereign of Sexuality.
You seem like you're anything but lazy, Uncle Billy.
Don't forget to tell them all your qualifications.
My father must've been amazing.
I never saw anybody turn so many shades of red.
Seriously? I'm doing all right?
How quaint.
That's great.  I'll just tell my creditors I'm not a rapist.  No problem... Shit.  I can't believe the board's going to act without even hearing my side of it.
Not that I'm going to be much good after last night...
I understand.
He said something like, "Do you want it dirty7" or something.  I tried to turn away, but he pushed me to the floor.
And when you turned her toward the door, where did you expect her to go, without a car?
No.
Weren't you a little worried about her...?
You can go up to one of those trees and peel the bark.  You know what you get? More bark.  And more bark.  There's no core.  Tree's not good tar anything but sucking up water.  And now they can't get rid of them.  They've tried poisons. Nothing works.  They don't die.
They chumped us, Gloria, right from the start.
Why?  You ask me, Lombardo had it pretty good already, nice job in a beautiful setting, popular, an active social life.  He's gonna put this all on the line for some dicey play like what you're describing...
Where'd you come up with this stuff, anyway?
Those are Suzie Toller's teeth.
Stick with me on this Gloria.  I need you...
That bothers you?
You didn't cuff her?
And then what... he touched you?  Did you maybe flirt a little...
I said he did.
You and Suzie used to come out here together?
I say something funny?
What are you looking at?
I thought we were goin' to a movie.
Aren't  you forgetting something?  Your coupon.  We gotta have it.
Drop dead... You know where my mom is trying to get the money to pay you off? She's trying to break my trust.  How do you like that?  I can't touch it until she's dead and she won't give me a dime and now she's trying to break it to pay you...
Yeah, he got her busted for possession...
Can't you take that stupid thing off?
Who is it?
Meet my partner, Gloria Perez.
Yeah, they're bad for your health.  I'm tryin' to look out for you...
I was worried about you, Suzie.  I decided we should all get together, one more time, before we split up.
But then you knew what he was like all along... Maybe his killing Kelly was a thing you had counted on...
I'll bet.  Look, Sam.  Why don't you come by this weekend.  We'll take the boat out...
What?  Running over alligators with that silly swamp jalopy when you could be sailing a real boat...
Shit. Here we go again.
Look.  I know you're seeing Barbara Baxter.  So what?
A giant... hydraulically operated microscope... that explodes?  Or maybe just someone who hates scientists.
All right, if it'll make you happy, I'll try that.
Aha!
Limestone quarry?
What was all that back there?
Could I just point out, this is a perfect example of the criminal mind exploiting modern invention.
At least the thing's not that fast. We just follow it.  Whenever it stops, we're there, waiting.
So... spontaneous.  All that leaping off buildings and Chinese fighting and whatnot.
When we find him, he is mine.
I don't have to tell you what that would do to our careers!
I'd love to stop him, but have you noticed the hundred armed men?
My hat is off to you, sir.
God in heaven, what is that?!
A new friend?
Anyone?
I'm not so sure Dr. Loveless would like to find his social secretary dancing in the dark with an uninvited stranger.
Thank you.  But the truth is, I'm a single woman in a man's world. That leaves me very few choices, doesn't it?
Would that include me?
She's perfectly safe.
Would you be thinking... ramming speed, sir?
Don't try to bamboozle me, Colonel. Has another scientist been kidnapped or not?
Yes sir.
I must compliment you on Miss Thompson... an exceptionally charming assistant.
That would be... the Mexican War?
Gotta get the Doctor someplace safe.
Hey, remember?  You don't need my help, Madmartigan.  Little rabbit trap like this?  Come on!  I could open it for you, but I wouldn't wanna insult you!
You managed alright.
Say what?
Don't make me angry, Peck.
Hey!  Somebody's coming!
You gotta promise to feed her.
These Pecks make terrible nurse- maids.
Now Willow, I know you're gonna blame me for this but it wasn't my fault...!
I was in love once, Willow.  She had a hold on my heart.  I could barely function.  I *was* a great swordsman!  I was knighted!  I could have been king!
What do you want!
Kill him!
Did *you* give that acorn its power?
We don't have much time left!  Go on!  Go on!
I must concetrate my imagination...to creat a new...reality!
I did it!  Madmartigan!  Come here! Look!  You gotta see this!  I did it!
I'm getting her out of there!
This can't be right.  This isn't a sorceress.  This is some kind of animal.
Maybe milking.
Cows. You know, cows?
Guess I'm not used to so much.
Where's Timmy and Buck?
You've got a man here and the kids are upstairs?
That's none of your goddamn business! So keep your goddamn holier-than- thou mouth shut!  Anyway, they like Fred.
You don't know anything... borrowed your car. Didn't say why. And you never heard of that woman and her boy.
Eli says you're a carpenter, Book.
Everything is all right, John.
Got to, Sam. You and I are going to a courthouse together, put some people behind bars.
What have you got?
The Amish boy saw him, Paul. I'll make it, but Set Donahue and the Homicide Department off my back or they'll blow the whole thing.
I hope you don't have any doubts about that.
I'm fine. I'm going to live a long time. That's what I called to tell you.
You might want to pass it along to Mac.
Samuel. Samuel Lapp.  But what happened here is none of his affair. My sister is expecting me... our train is leaving soon.
Doesn't surprise me. I meet a lot of people like that.
Look, I'm genuinely sorry...
Stay for awhile. Rest. I'll make coffee and breakfast.
What?
Tell him his tea stinks.
Vain. Proud. Such a person is Hochmutsnarr. He is not plain.
I was being foolish?
Wrong.
You admit you're lying?
Elaine, I've come to apologize for Lt. McElroy. He overstated the department's position.
I don't know where he is.
At home you'd never hear a woman scream at a man that way.
No? Why not?
Didn't you hear Stoltzfus? What if he dies? Then the sheriff will come. They'll say we broke their laws 
We'll pray that he doesn't die! But if he does, then we'll find a way so no one knows!
Eli, John is a carpenter.  As well as being a fine policeman.
I have committed no sin.
Never seen anything like that in all my years.
Just listen to what Miss Gulch did to Toto! She --
Oh, we dream lots of silly things when we --
Here, here, what's all this jabber-wapping when there's work to be done?  I know three shiftless farm hands that'll be out of a job before they know it!
Please, sir.  We've done what you told us. We've brought you the broomstick of the Wicked Witch of the West.  We melted her.
Well, I -- I -- I am the Great and Powerful -- Wizard of Oz.
Frightened?  You are talking to a man who has laughed in the face of death -- sneered at doom and chuckled at catastrophe.  I was petrified.  Then suddenly the wind changed, and the balloon floated down into the heart of this noble city, where I was instantly acclaimed Oz, the First Wizard de Luxe!
Now look, here's something that really has a heart. This is the best invention I ever invented.
Sure. It's to break up winds, so we don't have no more dust storms. Can you imagine what it'll mean to this section of the country? I'll show you. It works perfectly now. Here's the principle. You see that fan -- that sends up air currents into the sky. These air currents -- Oh, stop it!
Who did it? Now wait a minute.
Oh, now?
How did you guess?
Professor Marvel never guesses -- he knows! Now, why are you running away?
Oh, but he will!  He must!  We've come such a long way already. 
Oh, dear. I don't know what I'd do if a whole swarm kept -- Oh! Oh! Oh, there's one on me!
Oh - I'll get it!
...yes.
Well, of course not.  My goodness, what a fuss you're making.  Well, naturally, when you go around picking on things weaker than you are -- Why, you're nothing but a great big coward!
A home --
How about a hippopotamus?
I'd sooner wait outside.
Did they hurtcha?
Well -- I would never've found it if it hadn't been for you.
I have so got brains.
Down?  No, you see, I'm -- Well, -- I'm --
Ohh!  OHH!  OHH!
Ah --
...excellence to the Miracle Wonderland Carnival Company -- until one day, while performing spectacular feats of stratospheric skill never before attempted by civilized man, an unfortunate phenomena occurred. The balloon failed to return to the fair.
Who at?
Here --   Come on.
Up!
Come on -- I've got another idea.
Dorothy!
It's a whatzis?
Now, let' s see -- this goes -- Oh, I wish I were better at puzzles.
...the door! Open the door! Open the door! Open the door! Open the door!
Oh -- now look at him!  This is terrible!
Help! Help! Help! Help! Help!
Oh, don't worry about me. I'm all right. We must worry about Dorothy.
Oh, I hate to think of her in there.  We've got to get her out. 
Hey -- what about Dorothy?
-- Ruined my exit!
Not just nuclear. Powered by a nuclear reactor.  Hes not loading any cargo. They want the sub. The sub itself. Put weapons grade plutonium inside the subs reactor: Instant, catastrophic meltdown.
The King pipeline.
Dislocated collar bone.  If any more tendons snap...  It wont just be two weeks out of action.
Claude Serrault.  A.K.A...
Sacrifice the girl to take out the terrorist?
Get out to the pipeline. Find the insider who switched the pin. If your instincts are right, Renard will be back. He hasnt completed the job. The pipeline is still going forward, and we have Elektra to thank for that.
The report King bought. Its a manual. Renards men used it to remove this radio tracking device from the warhead.
You will never touch her. You will never get near her.
Funerals arent exactly memorable.
Its not the pin your father wore. Its an exact duplicate. Inside is a tiny electrical detonator. We have reason to believe the assassin had an inside accomplice, someone who worked at this company.
Always wanted to see the upper lines.
The way I acted, in the snow...you must think Im a coward.
What is it?
I dont want to be safe!
Are you saying...Renard is the man whos trying to kill me?
Im coming with you.
Wheres M?
All this, because you fell for Renard?
Bond. If someone wants you dead, it is Renard. Our government has nothing to gain by killing you.
I thought you were the one in her business.
Wheres the sub going?!
Warm.
Wrong answers?
That man, then, he was the first.  The first you --
I could stay and go.
Collect me?
The atmosphere.  I'm sorry.  These things slip my mind.
Yet you must've known all along that you'd give me cancer.  Just be being with me.
Because you can't, I know, it's preordained.  So sorry.  I forgot.  Jon.  This, this "script" you're following . . . who writes it?
Jon -- for Gods sake, what do you see?
My God.  Murdered?  -- What's this have to do with Rorschach?
Yeah.  See, I've been working on a little project.  Top secret, of course . . .
Gentlemen, the past.  Unfolding before your eyes.  Stand back from the field.  It'll blow you to bits.
Maybe not, but why take chances?
Eight cops?  Oh, great.  A jury's gonna love that.
Ohh.  I could use some dinner.  Who was that on the phone?
-- What is it.
It's a peace rally.  The CTU's just opened fire on the crowd.
Yes you are.
What's he doing?
The guidance system's fried.  I had to switch to manual.  -- Some kind of massive electromagnetic shockwave.
Nothing wrong with ketchup.
Their real names, please.
You're lying, Miss Juspeczyk.
Don't rub it in.  I live here.
The name's Gibbons. You were saying?
Is that a fact?
Sure as gravity. I've had a feeling about you from the start, Cage. It's nausea.
I plan on getting a lot older. And playing spy games sounds like a quick way to get yourself dead.
How about a pedicure as long as you're down there. What's this? Lo-Jack?
I expect you to call in regularly with progress reports.
Silent Night is the name of a top secret binary nerve agent. The glass canister is shot into the air and detonated. The black and white chemicals mix, forming a toxic cloud. When it settles down to Earth, it'll kill everything in the vicinity.
Thought you bought the farm down there, X. Glad as hell to see you.
All for show. Just a psychological mind game to get you to do the right thing.
Oh, I don't know. It was an accident.
What game is that?
Do they have any special powers? The bosses always have special powers.
It's gonna be like that, huh? You got all bent out of shape as soon as he started dancing with someone else. Why's that?
Maybe we should start again, yes? I know so little about you, except that you're not what you say you are.
Don't even start. I'll be honest, I don't trust you. Bur lets pretend for a minute that what you say is true, that I want to leave. What can you do about it?
Are you alright?
What are you doing with the Ivans?
We'll have to go after them.
You don't have to do that.
Yes, I do. You're right. I can't just let him go free. Besides, I can help you from the inside.
Did you do your homework?
If they launch it, I know how to bring it back.
You okay?
It's running three meters down. Twenty knots.
It has to surface to release the nerve agent, right?
What are you doing?
I can see that. Why?
You have all this talent, and you waste it. You won't take a single endorsement deal. Meanwhile those other guys have their own video games! But no, you've got too much "integrity" for that.
French Polynesia? This wouldn't last us a week in a cheap hotel. Do you know how expensive it is down there?
You're serious?
My name is Slovo, Czech secret police. When you are here you are under my jurisdiction, you take my orders, you do what I say. If you become any kind of an inconvenience, I'll shoot you.
Nice hops.
You tell me! You got a sniper up there or what?
What's "Anarchy 99"?
I've been here before, when I was a kid. My old man was in the service, we used to live on the Army base in Hamburg.
Including rape, pillage, murder.
Sure, if that's what you want. Why not? It's all human nature. So we just have to launch our baby and wait for the decline and fall of civilization as we know it.
What does that mean?
Can the Professor repair his own mind?
Yes -- Only there's a problem.  The mutator gene is not responding to the radiation the way it would in mother nature.  It's forcing the body's cells to replicate thousands of times faster than they're accustomed to.  The Senator's body is literally burning itself out.  Scott -- this machine kills people and I don't think Magneto realizes it.
Scott.. I -
I'm o.k.  I'm o.k.
Anything else I can get you?
I'll see what I can do -- You should get some sleep.  Even with your healing ability, you're going to be hurting for a while.
Let go.
I presume nothing, I am here to tell you that in time, the mutator gene will activate in every living human being on this planet.  Perhaps even your children, Senator.
Mr. Guyrich has been dead for some time Senator.
The intention of registration act -
What am I doing here?
I brought you here so that you would be safe from Magneto.
Forty-eight hours, old man.  But if you cross me, I won't feel any guilt about what I do to you.
Where are we going?
I've found her, Westchester Mall.
Still trying to make the world safe for our kind.  Still trying to find a way to introduce ourselves -- definitively.
The way what is going to be?
And what do you do when you wake up to that?
I think we all need a good night's sleep.  Why don't we meet next week and thrash this thing out?
Baack!
Did you see?...I put a special hamper in the bathroom just for your shirts.  the other one is just for socks and poo-poo undies.
Promise??
Very....very!
Ready, darling?
Is your room just down the hall? ... in case I get frightened during the night?
Would you want me, now, like this, so soon before our wedding? ... So near we can almost touch it? Or wait a little while longer, when I can give myself without hesitation?... When I can be totally and unashamedly yours??
No!  Dr. Frankenstein always kept that separate.
I see.  And where is my grandfather's private library?
I didn't do that.
One week -- I'll see to it, sir.
Saturday night then!  I'll take the train to New York and fly from there.
Fron kon steen!
Aye-gor!
What are you doing here?
What a filthy job!
How?
You'd better hurry -- I think it's going to rain.
The ancient masters promised impossibilities and performed nothing.  We shall penetrate into the recesses of nature.  We shall ascend into the Heavens.  We shall command the thunders of Heaven, mimic the earthquake and even mock the invisible world with its own shadows.
It's not enough.  More!  More, do you hear me?
You'll be getting me sad next.
Original.
Yes, Master!
What monster?
I'm going to untie you -- can you understand that?
MMMmmmmmm.
What is it?  Is something wrong, Doctor?
Well, this explains the music.
Reputation.  Reputation!
It has a pas-sion, 'The Con-ti nen-tal...'
All right -- give it to him!
Are you serious??
Did you do it?
Yes, I have mine.
All right if I turn out the lamp, sweetheart?
Are you ready for me?
How do you know they're done?
Oh, must be around ten... ten-thirty.
GRRRHMMNNNJKJMMMNN!
I have received intelligence from, sources of my own that the Zulu Impis are moving North of here and threaten your left.
Are you dictating the strategy of this war, Sir?
Yes?
How quickly can you move your artillery forward?
Well that one. The one who keeps looking at me.
