That's a shame.
Right.  See?  You're ready for the quiz.
That's because it's such a nice one.
You never wanted to go out with 'me, did you?
Thank God!  If I had to hear one more story about your coiffure...
Let's go.
You might wanna think about it
Would you mind getting me a drink, Cameron?
I did.
Oh, I thought you might have a date  I don't know why I'm bothering to ask, but are you going to Bogey Lowenstein's party Saturday night?
Why didn't you tell me?
I guess I'll never know, will I?
It's just you.
What if she never starts dating?
It's just a party. Daddy, but I knew you'd forbid me to go since "Gloria Steinem" over there isn't going --
I have a date, Daddy.  And he ' s not a captain of oppression like some men we know.
Never
C'mon.  I'm supposed to give you the tour.
I was kidding. People actually live there?
Couple thousand. Most of them evil
I could start with your haircut, but it doesn't matter.  She's not allowed to date until her older sister does.  And that's an impossibility.
Guess who just signed up for a tutor?
I'm serious, man, he's whacked.  He sold his own liver on the black market so he could buy new speakers.
Hey -- I've gotta have a few clients when I get to Wall Street.
Her favorite uncle
Yeah, and I noticed the only part of you featured in your big Kmart spread was your elbow.  Tough break.
Forget her sister, then.
Uh,  yeah.  We're old friend*
Hey -- it's all for the higher good right?
I got drunk.  I puked.  I got rejected. It was big fun.
Listen to you!  You sound like Betty, all pissed off because Archie is taking Veronica.
And why would I do that?
Hi
I just need to lie down for awhile
Uh, uh. You lie down and you'll go to sleep
Because then I'd have to start taking out girls who like me.
Why'd you lie?
This.
You don't strike me as the type that would ask permission.
I'm gettin' there
Look up, sunshine
Try lookin' at it from this angle
So if you disappoint them from the start, you're covered?
How?
You know what I mean
Look, I'm  -- sorry -- that I questioned your motives.  I was wrong.
I thought you could use it. When you start your band.
Well, yes, compared to your other choices of expression this year, today's events are quite mild.  By the way, Bobby Rictor's gonad retrieval operation went quite well, in case you're interested.
Right.
Whatever the hell it is you're standin' there waitin' to say.
What is it with this chick?  She have three tits?
Just for now.
I'm at a loss, then.  What should we talk about? Your year of absence?
You weren't abused, you aren't stupid, and as far as I can tell, you're only slightly psychotic -- so why is it that you're such a fuck-up?
Tumescent!
Dr. Ruth?
That ' s what I thought
The water's going putrid in the barrels.
With a face like that?  I don't want you looking at me.  You hear?
I know.
That's something you can't decide.
They tried... but I didn't let them.
May I ask by whom?
Bartolome and Giacomo Colon.
Appointment to what?
Yes... Yes, I do... On all of them!
I'm not bargaining!
All of them created by people like me.
You never learned how to speak my language.
How did you manage it?
Father Marchena!
I've been contradicted all my life... Eternity!
Only God knows the meaning of such words, my son.
Oh?  So you are a new man?
We came here to stay!  To build! Not to start a crusade.  In this forest, there is enough danger to sweep us away in days!  So we will be brave and swallow our grief.  And in the name of those who died, we will accomplish what we came for.
My horse doesn't work.
You'll be held in detention, deprived of your privileges and possessions.  Until you are returned to Spain where you will be judged. Have you anything to say?
God be with us admiral.
You think I don't know that?
The land is there.  I know it!
Jesus Maria!  I should have never listened to you!
Yes, Your Majesty.
We weren't expecting immediate profits, were we?  We must have faith.  We must give time for time.
Well, you didn't appreciate the severity of it until recently.  No question about that.
What about my movie rights?  Book rights?
Officers, there's your killer, do your duty, arrest him!
Yes, I considered it.
No.
What about back home?
What are you asking me?
I'm sorry.  I didn't mean to...I'm glad. Actually I'm glad it's over.  All this time.  Hiding.  Never being able to look anyone in the eyes. Always afraid that someone would find out who I was.  Never trusting anyone...
If you were my boyfriend, I'd suggest you find another girlfriend that isn't going to jail ten-thousand miles away.
I don't want to drag you down with me.
Well, I'm the Deputy Chief Fire Marshall and every now and then I'd like to be included in decisions.
Look, after Jordy briefs me, you can do the press conference.  How about that? The case is all yours.
Okay.  But not water sports.
Chief - I know I screwed up - but this guy was no innocent civilian.
You do that, wiseguy.  Now let's solve this thing before Eddie Flemming does.
Takin' a bath.
Still unknown but we're running prints. Kid over there caught the case.
Do you have any Czech girls working for you?
Look, I'm not even sure she has anything to do with this.  I saw her outside after the fire - thought it was a lead. Maybe she saw something.  Maybe she was visiting somebody here.  Who knows?
Of course.
What would your girlfriend think of that?
Well, you shoulda because nobody's gonna believe you didn't...including me.
What's your accomplishment.
Then do it, asshole.
Smarter than Americans.  You're fed cry baby talk shows all day long.  Not only will Americans believe me, they'll cry for me.  So...Detective Eddie Flemming, would you like to say goodbye to your Nicolette? Maybe you can propose to her now?
You know you can't do that.  C'mon.
Do you have the suspect in custody?
Alright?
Alright.
Okay.
Maybe I should just, ya know...turn to the cameras and say, do you mind if we just work something out?
I'm not.
Well, that's great.
Okay.
You're worried for my safety.  I'm touched.
We'll talk about that.  Four o'clock gives you time to go to bank.  Three hundred thousand dollars.
Tommy, take a walk.
You'll be my first.
Look.  Do we have a problem here? There's no reason to have a problem. I'm gonna make you feel real good.  You wanna Czech girl? After I'm done with you, you won't miss her.  Now why don't you pay me?
How much money are you carrying with you?
I have five-hundred dollars.
Yes.
Is there a problem?
In here, says he wants a million.
Shut up.
What does it look like?  It's an address book!
No, I don't get that!
Milos.  Get my money!
Okay.  You're a Czech national and you're a Russian national.  How do you know one another?
Well, he killed my partner!
Don't stoop to his level!
And isn't there a movie in the works about you?
Okay. 
Just ask Hal. It's conceivable they might keep something from us, but they'd never keep anything from Hal.
You probably also know that we found them okay.
Yes, it is.
I suppose you're pretty broken up about it?
Okay, sweetheart. Well, I have to go now. Tell Mommy that I called.
How many days until you come home?
Fortunately, they did.
Tomb, shine, survey-marker spare part, take your choice.
I will if I can, Frank.
Our Mission Profile calls for Discovery going to Saturn. True or false?
There is no other purpose for this mission than to carry out a continuation of the space program, and to further our general knowledge of the planets. Is that true?
Roger.
Look, give me a break, you're going to have to settle for her place.  It's the only thing I know.
Hey, what kind of talk is that?
No, it's gotta be here and now. Believe me. Only I don't have the damn money for a room...
Hey, no, I'm tryin' to be nice. Buy yourself something pretty. I'd do it, but I got to go.  I got this cop waitin' for me...
No time for any of that crap any more, lady... I'll rip your lungs out if you don't answer fast.
Yeah.  Sure, i'm crazy in love with him, who wouldn't be...
I got a lot to protect.
Luther was part of the gang?
I can read a police file, shithead, and quit calling me Jack.
Thank you.
Mission District.  Gonna find us an Indian.
I'm impressed with you too, Jack you did a real good job of busting up a couple of dykes bedded down for the night.
Naw, you'd just call your pals back to bail you out one more time.
Depends on how things work out. I believe in the merit system. So far you haven't built up any points.
Yeah.  Right.
Jesus Christ.  That's a disgrace The guy pulls a gun on a cop and he's out in 24 hours.  I tell you some of the courts these days are just a fucking revolving door.
Didn't know you darker people went in for foreign jobs.
Tryin' to save his girl, man. He's in another world.
What you don't understand is, I don't give a damn about how this thing looks.
Class isn't somethin' you buy, punk. Look at you, five hundred dollar suit and you're still a lowlife.
Yeah, most cops are pretty dumb... But since you're the one that landed in jail what's that make you?
Right. if you ever switch from armed robbery to pimping, then you're all set.
Let him get some sleep.  He's going to need it.
Luther's on the move...
Back to jail in my own car.  Ganz got away. Got all my money. It just don't seem right.
Yeah, and I know Ganz sure ain't no sweetheart... I wouldn't like it if this partnership ended before it gets started.
There's nothin' to talk about.
No, you don't. If I ever get word of you steppin' over the line again, I'm gonna ventilate that suit of yours.
No trouble, Jack. But, listen, suppose I stay a crook?  Where'd you get the idea that you could catch me?
Yeah, I read the report...
Yeah?
Try not to get your ass shot to pieces. We got enough dead cops on this one.
The truth hurts, doesn't it, buddy?
I guess when two cops die on account of your fuck up you want to keep it as quiet as possible...
Backup man from the East Bay. Worked with Ganz a few years ago and sprung him from the road gang.
Uhh ... Wong, Henry Wong.  He was in on the same job.
I'm heading out. How about you?
Okay.  See you in the morning... you know, you ought to get some rest...
When? How?
I dunno ... he's gonna call me...
Irrigated his face with the shot of J and B I'd just poured him. Then I tried to deck the sucker.
Maybe that makes a nice excuse.
Maybe you don't know what the hell you're talking about.
That's the way I see it, too.
Look, Jack, if you make everything your personal responsibility, you'll turn into a bad cop.  It's not a practical way to function...
Elaine, look, I'm in the middle of sone stuff right now... I'm not gonna have time to come by. I don't know when I can get there.
I can see that.  Pardon me for saying so, but you look like shit.  What happened?
So what?
Name's Hammond, Reggie Hammond. I heard a lot about you. And any friend of Jack's is a friend of mine.
Hey, two days with him is enough.
Naw, right here's okay.
This is clean shit.  No serial numbers and never been used...
Give it back.
I'll got your money to you. No sweat.
Even it I did know where the stones were I would never tell somebody like you.
Ah, Father... You are so wrong. Let me explain...
You noticed...
Uh yes, we're cousins..distant cousins..
Thank you so much for your help Mr...?
That's what I thought.
We have to save the world.
Good luck..
Theoretically, yes! The four Stones form the beam and the Fifth Element is supposed to stand in the middle there, but... I don't have the reference book. I've never seen the Stones work!
White turns to black.  Light to Dark. Life to Death.  For all eternity.
You're not that bad... Come on we'll get you to a doctor.
Vito Cornelius?
Leeloo Minai Lekarariba-Laminai-Tchai Ekbat De Sebat.
...Not yet.
How you doing this morning?  Sleep OK? I didn't.
This is a police control action..
Anyone know how to release the lines on this crate?
Found it?
I'll take you to the bar, after that, you're on your own.
I mean my future.. my ex.. My future ex.. if she sees you here I'm finished.  She hates you guys. It's what killed us in the first place. Please...
Cornelius..
Took the words right out of my mouth. Go on... I'll be right with you.  It's our honeymoon. We're going to use the trip to get to know each other better.
All 900.
I want to sleep... forever...
You're right but there are lots of good things... beautiful things...
Why?... Why would you need me?
I've never gotten a message that wasn't bad news.
Don't fuck with me man or I'll blow you into tomorrow!
Perfect, Mr. President.
Who gives a shit! I didn't come here to listen to music! Listen up instead of running off at the mouth! The batteries on my phone are almost gone.
Yes, Sir!
Honey, I'm not, please...
Sure.  I'll call the guy.
Amy, it's me.  Listen very carefully..
You couldn't?
Look where we are.  Look at yourself.  You son of a bitch, you don't have any idea what you're putting me through...
Tom... she's dead.
There ain't no such thing as snuff. Why don't you fuck off?
Is it?
Five thousand now, five thousand on delivery. Two women, one white and one black, as long as they have large breasts. Hard bondage, or course.  Other than that, trusting your artistic interpretation, I have only two stipulations.
I'll consider it.
What's the problem?
Look, I don't know what this...
Leave him alone.
Fuck off.
Call me Tom.
Well, that's all I can do.  Sorry.
What the fuck are you.. ?
It was a lot of fucking money.
Something like that.
What did you do, knock her out, shoot her up... ?
I fucking don't know.  What do you think... we weren't burying treasure.  We didn't pace it out so we could come back and get it.  We dug a hole and we put her in it. Your guess is as good as mine.
Easy enough for you.
I never killed anyone.
As Mr. Christian's attorney and one of the executors of his estate, it concerns me that a meeting of this sort should take place without my being asked to attend.
I was well compensated.
Because he could.  He did it because he could.  What other reason were you looking for?
Pardon me?
Wouldn't want to embarrass yourself in front of your fellow perverts.
Three, four years.
Not quite.
Four hundred a week, off the books.
Sounds good, pops.
Tomorrow night, I get off at eight.
Snuff films.
I don't mean any offense... but what are you doing mixed up in all this?
I see a ring on your finger.  You have any kids?
Take a vacation.  I'll pay you four hundred a day, plus expenses.
Nobody knows his name.  That's his thing.  He always wears a mask.  You never see his face.  He calls himself "Machine," that's what they call him.  Machine.
You are highly recommended.  Praised for your discretion... your strict adherence to confidentiality.
He succeeded.
Mrs. Christian... please, will you sit down a moment?  I want you to listen carefully. What you're talking about is a "snuff film."  But, from what I know, snuff films are a kind of... urban myth.  Like, red light district folklore.  There's no such thing, I can assure you.
Will you watch it and see for yourself?
It won't work like that.
Any evidence you collect can be given to the police later, anonymously.  I've thought about it and there's no other way.  If you can't find them... if the only thing that comes from this film is that this is all my husband will be remembered for, well I can't let that happen.  I'm telling you I won't.  If there's no chance that poor girl's memory can be served, then I'll just have to spend my last days trying to forget her.
Totalled together, these five checks from five different accounts, they equal one million dollars.
You told me to look, so I looked.
You have to forgive me, but in these circumstances... with your daughter...  Were there any indications of... any sort of abuse?
Of course.
No.
I don't know.  I think so.
It is possible... and I know this isn't something you want to hear. Your daughter may have tried to hide a note where she thought you would eventually find it, but where she knew your husband would never find it.  She might have wanted to tell you something...
Yes.
I'm trying to find out.  She was a runaway.  I'm looking into it for her parents.
What?
I haven't slept much either.  Since Kristen...
Figure it out?!?!  I'll be insane before I figure it out.  The only thing I'm sure of is that I can't go to sleep.  Not while he's using me.
Great, you wouldn't happen to know his phone number?
What?
That obvious, huh?
Rick stayed later after school with Kristen.  She wasn't feeling very well.
I know.  Uh...Alice.
You just feel sorry for me.
It was Freddy.
I saw it. It was my dream.  I brought Sheila in...
Well Mom, I'll tell ya, when two of your friends die the same day, you let me know what it does to your appetite.
It's no story.  It happened.  Freddy's real and he's back.
It's okay, Dan
He says it's easy.  Especially with sad people.  With closed-off people.
He'll show up.  C'mon, what's really wrong?
You're right.
No.  A deal's a deal.
Sobering...
I've got to go.
When Dan died you weren't even asleep. You said so.  End of story.
Jacob.  We've got to get to Amanda before it's too late.
We've got to go to the asylum and find her body.  Mark said her soul's trapped with it -- that's why she can't come to me.  It must be!
Why don't I go make some coffee.  There's a lot to tell.
She killed herself.  Her soul's gonna be in torment.
Stick around, please?
<u>You</u> said it.  But I won't argue -
You're really a mixed-up oddball, aren't you?
I don't know.
So they caught up with you, too?
Sounds like it!  Distress call, from a small freighter, between Ellesmere Island and Greenland. One mayday, then...nothing.
I think you're right.
The sound again?
What about down?
I...don't know!
All internal repairs completed, and Frogmen report exterior damage minor.
What????
Wonderful!
Suppose our theorizing is correct? Then this <u>could</u> be the next danger point!
<u>We</u> harness energy on a small scale by cutting magnetic lines of force.  Maybe Cyclops does it on a <u>super</u> scale....
If we could get inside the saucer - use our torches - maybe we could cut the Shark loose?
<u>That</u> might be a <u>little</u> <u>rough</u>!
No. Black.
All the figures show is that Gordon LaRiviere is going to be a very rich man using his position as Selectman. In a year or two, you won't recognize this town.
Hard to say. If we go for custody, depositions, psychiatric evaluations, it could drag on. Ten or twelve thousand dollars. She could win on appeal. If we just want to get the visitation rights redrawn, assuming they're unduly restrictive, it wouldn't be more than twenty-five hundred.
Maybe I can buy him off. I gotta talk to Mel.
Damn straight!
Mmm.
I get it.  No sweat. You'll get yourself a deer and you'll get him dead. And you'll have him by coffee time.
Sun's gettin high.
Where's that gun you were bragging on today?
A half mile in, along the old lumber road.
You bring him up yourself? That's a steep climb.
The ambulance guys lugged him up.
What the fuck you telling me, Wade? I never seen the guy get shot, I told you that.
He sure as hell won't.
Yeah.
Look. Those kids are still trick-or- treating. They're still out.
But it's not funny now.
No. She doesn't talk about you anymore.
It's fun.
I want to go home.  I don't like it here.
No what?
No I didn't see anybody I know. No I don't want to go to school here tomorrow. I want to go home.
I called Mommy.
See, I knew you'd be mad.
Yes.
I'm glad you're here. Can you stay for a while?
I know.
You're a policeman.
Okay, let's go home, then.
Huh?
You don't want the extra police pay?
You Rolfe?  I remember you from high school. You're a teacher now? Harvard?
He say anything about the summons I tried to give him? Sonofabitch wouldn't accept it.
Want to buy?
We've done all our talking, Wade.
I'm sure, I'm positive it didn't happen the way Jack says it did.
Everybody needs money. Except guys like Twombley and that sonofabitch son-in-law of his. People like that.
After making love. I like it. It's nice to see that in a grown-up person.
There's another thing I've been thinking about. I don't know how you feel about the idea, Margie, because we've never talked about it. But I've been thinking lately, I've been thinking we should get married sometime. You and me.
I don't know for Christ's sake!
Is...? She's dead then?
Makes me sad it was her. Instead of me. I shoulda froze.
What the hell are you talking about?
Doing your fucking job. I know. I watch television too.
You get the hell out of my house now, asshole. And know this -- you are going to be a lucky asshole if I haven't got you fired before the day is out. I can do it with one phone call, and I'm pissed enough to do it now!
Something about my father?
Marg! You got orders!
The fucker shot himself. Ker-bang! That's what it sounds like. Not on purpose. I assume accidental.
The other guy.
Where... how'd you hear that?
His office. You mean my old office.
Atta-go.
Wade. I thought she was alright. Till this morning she was.
You think you can take me now? Come on, try.
Crawl!
Wade, it's late. I know you're probably at Toby's, but I'm in bed reading. We got different habits.
He was scheduled to testify for a committee investigating organized crime in New England and the construction business.
The night before the shooting.
No thanks. I don't drink.
Want to know what I think happened?
That it wasn't an accident.
I don't know. You tell me.
Yeah, the guy with the BMW I told you about. I did, didn't I?
Shit, around here, you shoot somebody in the woods, you say it was an accident, you get fined fifty bucks and your hunting license lifted. Jack's probably saying the guy shot himself cause he ain't got his deer yet and don't want his license pulled.
It wasn't me. I wasn't there, but I heard about it. When I heard about it, it was about Elbourne.
Well, I never heard that one.
Wade, are you alright?
I'm sure he's busy.
No, it's okay.  After all, he is the President, right?
Smart for your age, eh? Top of your class? Tell me, do you know what the word &quot;propaganda&quot; means?
It would be a pity to squander such a strong personality.
They are in our airspace. We would be within our rights.
Got it.
Pop it open. There should be a red switch, toggle it up.
Copy Air Force One. Welcome to the party.
He's busy being dead.
An exercise in futility. Send the Nimitz back in.
My loyalty was never to my country.
Roger.
You don't know the half of it.  Did you know this entire plane is shielded from radiation?  We could fly through a mushroom cloud completely unharmed if necessary.
Conference rooms, though some have other functions.  The one up front doubles as an emergency medical center.
Very good. Thank you, Ms. Mitchell.
What do you know of my husband?
We can't jump from here or at this speed. But if we could get a message out - tell the refueling plane...
Can't it wait?
Rose, I don't have time for this.
Well, they aren't burning me in effigy. That's always a good sign.
Please... don't start with me.
The fax machines.
We're handling it, sir.
Sir, the President does not call this particular number. So whoever you are get a life, before I have this call traced.
Look lady, I don't have time for games. Just put the....
I might still have a few chips left.
*                     We could always put you in a duck blind with a twelve gauge.  The second amendment types'll love that.
Did we tape the Duke game?
Twenty-five years.
I wonder how your boys in Washington are going to take this one.
Felt like a large asteroid.
There's nothing wrong with me!
We can't go back.  We had something very special, but it's all over.
Ted, a toilet's not going to kill anyone.
Elaine, what's going on?
That was very well put, Ted.
I just want you to know, I love you Ted and always will.
Not when I'm with you, Ted.
Now!
So mentally ill?
He tried to disconnect ROK.  It gassed him.  That computer is running this ship and we're heading right for the sun.
Can't we change course?
Yeah.
Sixteen 'C', why?
I opened this panel and a vacuum cleaner hit me.
Not if the people change together in relation to that love.
Sure.  But that's only when the love itself goes unchanged.
That's very nice of you. Thank you.
No. I'm from Washington, D.C. I'm a lobbyist for the Small Businessmen's Assocation.
You know, here we are having coffee together, and discussing education and business and economy...and we don't even know each other's names...full names I mean.
Something about a plane with no pilot?
Shep, no! I'll bet you have exciting things happen all the time down there.
Surely you can't be serious.
I <u>am</u> serious, and don't call me Shirley! What flying experience have you had?
Let's see. Those are the flaps, that's the thrust, this must turn on the landing lights.
Chicago, the passengers are beginning to panic. When do we start down?
I'm not sure. I haven't seen anything like this since the Lina Wertmuller Film Festival.
It's a big building with patients. But that's not important right now. Tell the Captain I must speak to him.
Elaine, not yet. I promise you I really can change.
But it won't be. Not as long as you insist on living in the past!
Headquarters!? What is it?
I don't care. I just don't have what it takes. They'd be better off with someone who'd never flown before.
Every day.
Well, it wasn't all that I had hoped.
I will, but Jim won't.
Oh -- I haven't flown for a long time.
Would you go up, please?
Ss'ai k'ss?  Perfect.
She did, did she?  Well, she was wrong.  Excuse me, I have to change.
I'm Sergeant Sykes, and this is Detective Jetson, Los Angeles Police Department.
My true name is Ss'tangya T'ssorentsa'.
With two BRI Sabot slugs in the chest.
Well, there's a thing about partners, about being somebody's partner.  You do for each other. And other people's rules don't mean shit.  It's the rules set up between the two of you, that's all that counts.  Understand?  Okay.  Well, my friend and partner was shot last night and I'm after the shitbag that did it.  As my partner, I'm asking you to respect me and help me find him.
Nothing.
Nothing?
Well... Yeah, it's rubber.  It stretches.
Did you learn anything?
Did you talk to him?
Agree to work with me?  You don't like me... you don't like any of us. You have nothing but contempt for us.  And yet you become an outcast from your club of detectives by making me your partner...
Screw me?  That can't be right.
In the camps, we were lodged four to a room.  The selection process was entirely random.  We did not get to stay with our friends... or families...
When will Strader return?
Was.  Divorced.
I appreciate your honesty, George.
Sticking out of his ass... yeah! See, that's what makes it a joke. There's like a surprise, and your mind fills in the funny picture. Here's this guy with a pen stuck in his ass and he thinks it's a thermometer.  Nada, huh?
Ta ss'trakyona'...
You humans are very curious to us. You invite us to live among you, in an atmosphere of equality we've never known before.  You lay before us a beautiful green world, full of freedoms and opportunities... You give us ownership of our lives for the first time... and you ask no more of us than you do of yourselves: to live by the rules... rules that aren't made to keep one people subordinate to another, but rules that exist to preserve equality.  You aspire to very high ideals here.
Don't count on me, George.  I never had any ideals.
A man, a human, was wiring it to your car.  I didn't get a good look at him.  I must call my wife...
Why?
Please, I must get out here.
Casull .454 Magnum.  You're talking twice the impact energy of .44 Magnum hot loads.
Yeah, the shells are too big for six in an cylinder.  Hell, Matt, you don't need but one.
No... two.
For you, anything.
Yeah.
Lucky for you, you got him in both of his... well, what we loosely refer to as... hearts.
Let's go.  Pull 'em out.
I'm afraid so.  The crash did too much damage.  The overload is inevitable, at this point.
All right.  Let's get on it.  What'll you need?
I get the picture.
Well, the corporation co-financed that colony with the Colonial Administration, against mineral rights.  We're getting into a lot of terraforming...'Building Better Worlds.'
I heard you were working in the cargo docks.
She's right.
What rank?  I believe Corporal Hicks has authority here.
This operation is under military jurisdiction and Hicks is next in chain of command.  Right?
But they will know about it, Burke. From me.  Just like they'll know how you were responsible for the deaths of one hundred and fifty-seven colonists here --
He's coming in.  I feel safer already.
Alive?
That's right.  So we put up welded barricades at these intersections...  ...and seal these ducts here and here.  Then they can only come at us from these two corridors and we create a free field of fire for the other two sentry units, here.
Let's waste him.  No offense.
Stand back.
Oh, God.  Jesus.  This ain't happening.
It's readin' right.  Look!
Yeah, you know.  In the walls, under the floor.  I was the ace.  I could hide better than anybody.
Oh.  Sorry, Newt.
My mommy always said there were no monsters.  No real ones.  But there are.
His Grace is very angry with you.
And he's been commissioned to write an opera. Is it true?
Why not?
Where?
Turkish? Oh, if it's Turkish, that's different. I want to be in it.
I'll be right back.
I assume she's the virtuoso in that department. There can't be any other reason you'd marry someone like that.
But he needs to be here in Salzburg, Your Grace. He needs me and he needs you. Your protection, your understanding.
Sir -
How much provocation am I to endure from you? The more license I allow you, the more you take.
Are you drunk? You invited me. And my horse. Here he is. Ottavio!
Oh shut up. I'm sick to death of that tune.
I want to go back to Vienna.
We are in the Residence of the Fartsbishop of Salzburg.
That's stupid.
Iram - marry Em - marry me! No, no! You're a fiend. I'm not going to marry a fiend. A dirty fiend at that.
Eat my - ah!
Stanzi!
Yes, my love?
Why?
Why not?
How charming.  But why did he not come himself?
I understand.
Would it be too much trouble, sir, to ask you to look at them now? While I wait.
I - I really cannot do that, Your Excellency. You see, he doesn't know I'm here.
My husband is a proud man, sir. He would be furious if he knew I'd come.
Then don't. It's up to you. Not to be vague, that is the price.
Not at all.
I was. But she quite outgrew the little I could show her.
May I try it?
Cattivo again, Court Composer. Well, tell him, Mozart. Name us a German virtue.
Ah-ha. Favouritism. But I so want Mozart.
You please me, Court Composer. A very clever idea.
My dear fellow, there are in fact only so many notes the ear can hear in the course of an evening. I think I'm right in saying that, aren't I, Court Composer?
Enchanted, Madame.
Well, my advice is to marry this charming young lady and stay with us in Vienna.
Thank you, Sire!
I think you are rather innocent, my friend. In these dangerous times I cannot afford to provoke our nobles or our people simply over a theatre piece.
Well. There it is.
Your Majesty, Herr Mozart -
Am I not welcome?
Of course, welcome! Welcome ten thousand times. Papa! my Papa!
That's not what I hear.
They say you're in debt.
Papa!
What have you got for me today? Let me see.
Where?
They'll be paid for by a great admirer or yours who wishes to remain anon - anonymous.
No, no, I love that. I'd want it to be in German. I haven't done anything in German since Seraglio.
Put it down!
Put it down, I said! It's nothing for you.
Yes.
No doubt, sir. But I am endowed with talent, and you with money. If I offer mine, you should offer yours.
Herr Sommer.
I'm afraid not.
Two thousand, two hundred florins is all I need A hundred? Fifty?
I can't say. Really
I don't think you should become known in Vienna as a debtor, Mozart. However, I know a very distinguished gentleman I could recommend to you. And he has a daughter. Will that do?
You burned the score?
How could I not?
What work?
A Mass for the dead.
Work fast. And be sure to tell no one what you do. You will see me again soon.
No, no. I have to get back. I have -
Oh no. It is a sublime piece. The grandest operone. I tell you, you are the greatest composer known to me.
I do.
Who?
Finish what?
Would you? Actually, you could.
Strange!
Yes.
With the tenors.
Yes.
I - I don't think you have, Herr Director. Not yet. I mean, it's quite n - Of course, I'll show it to you immediately.
Just let me tell you how it begins.
Yes, but this is not a ballet. This is a dance at Figaro's wedding.
Exactly. A dance.
But surely the Emperor didn't mean to prohibit dancing when it's part of the story.
Oh yes, certainly. Certainly, Herr Director!
Why not? It's charming. I mean, I don't actually show concubines exposing their! their! It's not indecent!  It's highly moral, Majesty. It's full of proper German virtues. I swear it. Absolutely!
So?
Leave me alone.
Of course. The man you accuse yourself of killing.
Every day. Sometimes for hours I would pray!
Oh yes, yes, yes, yes, yes! Always the same stale answers!  There is no God of Mercy, Father. Just a God of torture.
No, Father. From now on no one will be able to speak of Mozart without thinking of me. Whenever they say Mozart with love, they'll have to say Salieri with loathing. And that's my immortality - at last! Our names will  be tied together for eternity - his in fame and mine in infamy. At least it's better than the total oblivion he'd planned for me, your merciful God!
Mozart is writing a new opera. An Italian opera.
Excuse me - didn't His Majesty specifically forbid ballet in his opera?
Yes, absolutely. Is there a ballet in Figaro?
What? Who the devil are you?
Oh, I'm tender enough for you, my boy. I'm tender enough for you.
Show her in. Then go to bed.
But he's all right?
Of course.
Bene.
How did he look?
I'm an orderly, not a bleeding psychiatrist! I push things about, but I've little say what happens to them.
Thank you.
He said 'Jack'.
No, sir. Of course, sir. Good day, Doctor.
It's a full moon. Where is he?
What shall we do?
No, why?
Tea would be nice.
You haven't eaten your lunch.
Aw come on, Alex!
Shall I be forced to feed you, Mr. Kessler?
Shall I be forced to feed you, David?
Right.
That's not really a very proper question.
Yes, go on.
A doper werewolf.
I'm freezing.
David, let's go now.
No.
I think he's a Jew.
Yes, Mrs. Hobbs.
You're going to have to stop this disturbance or I shall arrest you.
Mr. Bringsly, I'm sorry. I have absolutely no idea what to say to you.
You could have told them!
An American film about the Mafia called 'See You Next Wednesday', and I want to see it badly, so you give me no problems and go to sleep.
Some, everyone does.
I should think so after your recent traumatic experiences.
Two weeks?
Lunatic?
Sure, as a kid. But never so real. Never so bizarre.
I've told you, it wasn't a man. It was an animal. A big wolf or something. A rabid dog.
You'd be surprised what horrors a man is capable of.
Then why the hell are you so quick to disbelieve me? You yourself said it must have taken incredible strength to tear apart a person like that.
If you don't stop, I'm going to kill you.
Maybe the owners are from Texas.
Listen, that's a pentangle, a five- pointed star. It's used in witchcraft. Lon Chaney, Jr. and Universal Studios maintain it's the mark of the wolf man.
You ask them.
I see and they were too embarrassed to talk about it, because they felt so silly.
Pecos Bill.
Let's just keep walking.
Walk away, Jack.
Get the fuck out of here, Jack.
I'm sorry to be upsetting you, David, but I had to come.
Yeah. Your parents came to my funeral. I was surprised at how many people came.
The wolf's bloodline must be severed. The last remaining werewolf must be destroyed.
Nurse!
Nurse! Oh God! Alex!
Aren't you going to say, 'I told you so'?
Thank you.
If you did it wrong, it would be painful. You'd choke to death.
He's on the telephone.
Tell him I'm out. No, tell him I've passed away. An old war wound or something. Tell him I'm dead. And no more calls!
I'd like some tea, please.
Sgt. McManus, are you suggesting that David and Jack were, in fact, attacked by some animal and that the officialdom of East Proctor has conspired to keep it a secret? We have an autopsy report on the murderer who was shot in the act by the local police. We have two witnesses to the crime. You'll forgive me, Mr. Kessler, if I consider your testimony as coming from someone who has gone through a terrible shock.
How much?
Yeah.
Baby, I can't give you anything but love...
What good will that do?
What do you mean, help?
No. You can't reason with anyone else when you're in a jam. We pleaded with you to keep liquid, but you wouldn't listen to us. You preached to us about faith and a lot of other rubbish. Now you want our help. You want us to throw a lot of cash into a bank that you've wrecked. All right. There's one way you can get it. Give us an option on your stock and resign as president.
Where were you at twelve o'clock last night?
Nothing, nothing, Mr. Dickson. Don't pay any attention to me. I don't know what I'm saying.
You just mentioned her name. What was she doing there? What was she doing in your apartment?
But after all, you can't take blood from a stone.
You don't have to do nothing.
All you gotta do is fix a few things for us , and we'll do the rest, see?
Well, you can. You always could.
What is?
But you see, it isn't blarney where you're concerned.
Please, please don't laugh at me, Phyllis. I must see you tonight!
I knew I couldn't trust you. You told me you were taking me home.
Good for you. Come on.
Wait a minute.  How do you feel this morning?
Listen, it isn't so terribly important. We can go to the theatre any time.
The theatre?
Yes, of course.
You can take some of the girls. You can take Mildred - or Gwynn
The girls!  I don't suppose it ever occurred to you that I might go out and find myself an attractive young man . . .
Don't you forget that I'm still the head man around here too. Now we'll get the tickets changed for tomorrow night. You and I are going out together. How's that?
Yes, sir.
Yes, sir.
Yes?
Hello, Helen.
Mr. Schaffer will take good care of you. He'll give you fifteen - maybe twenty . . .
Looks good. How much did it cost?
And what's more, keep up the good work and who knows - some day you'll be the fellow sitting behind that desk . . .  Not a bad thought, eh?
There you are.
I can't tell you.
Gee, thanks, Mr. Dickson
Here's the data on the Clyde deal.
Yes, sir.
I hate to do this, but I've got to have time to dig up some help. I think I know where I can get some real cash. Snap into it, Sampson. We will lick this thing yet.
Absolutely.
Is that busy husband of mine busy?
Helen, did you ever try competing with a bank?
Say Matt, you haven't done anything about what you saw today, have you?
Can you imagine that guy? He was kissing her.
All right, dear.
Mr. Williams . . .
He was here?
Sure I do. He has the best room in me house. The one with the fancy wallpaper.
Huh?
You used to carry a gun, didn't you?
Yes.
I guess so.
They're starting to come in already. Yeah. Yeah. Well, listen. Don't waste any time. Get all the money you can lay your hands on, and bring it down here right away. Step on it.
Sometimes a wound will kill.
That was because of... the reputation the gang had.
WHAT HAVE YOU DONE?!
He's not bad at it.
I can hit those boys from here. We just need a distraction.
Oh no...
Tomorrow.
Yes. I am obviously not standing out in people's minds at the robberies.
Tell me.
Planting corn. Harvesting corn. Year after year.
All right, calm down. I'll agree Sadie was a woman --
I got three.
What will be?
Which one, right or left?
Sadie was not a man!
They gonna rush us?
When have you ever known Old Man Tucker not to be yelling at everybody?
I think he's already feeling better.
Mm-hmm.
No, Jesse, your problem is you're always doing stuff before I'm finished figuring it out.
Saved all our lives, Doc. None of the Liberty boys would have come home if not for Web Mimms, Doc. God's honest truth.
You are a charmer.
It's the scientific method. It's all the rage.
You've killed your fair share of men.
A better life than the one you could have had with Zee?
See you soon. Oh, and I appreciate the distraction back there.
I think... he was just a real interestin' fella to have around.
We're just fine, thank you, sir.
We know, Ma. Now we got to get you to Doc Mimms.
But you got big!
If there's anything we can do for you, Dr. Mimms. We want to help.
Teasing you is completely unfair.
I wasn't the only one risking my neck that day.
Sparkling rocks?
Yep.
I had to see you. I'm getting married.
She's beautiful. Smart. And has the biggest... buck teeth in all of Missouri.
I've got you. You keep me busy. I figure we'll get over to the hotel... get checked in, cleaned up... then I'd like to do something I've been thinking about for a long time.
"But the life of the James Gang wasn't all robbing and shooting and killing, for these young Missouri bucks had a taste for the ladies... especially the handsome and charismatic Jesse James."
Aw, shucks, ma'am...
If you don't see it, it's not real...
Yes ma'am.
But I like the presidential suite.
Pity.
I'm not hanged yet.
You cocky little bastard.
Thank you.
Oh, you were talking to Jesse.
Lyla Devereux.
Really?
I'm doing you folks a favor --
By burning down their homes?
You see the Army leaving and you see the loss of a tool. I see a power void to be filled. As we have the most power, we may move with impunity.
I'll teach these podunks what happens when they challenge the righteousness of progress.
I'll kill them for blowing up my railway!
To be precise, they didn't blow up the tracks.
THEN WHO DID?!
I remember you.
Not such a menace now, is he, Pinkerton?
And there are some towns in Missouri where James and his men can walk openly, as heroes.
I demand action.
It's going to be a long spring.
Uh huh.
Patrick don't call me pumpkin anymore, okay? I have to go.
Oh God, Patrick. Shut up.
Yes.
I never knew you smoked.
You look marvelous. There's nothing to say. You're going to marry Luis. Next week, no Less.
Well, I actually might need a little surgery after last time.
Really?
It's not.
You're inhuman.
Good coloring.
That's bone. And the lettering is something called Silian Rail.
No, serial killer, Wisconsin in the fifties. He was an interesting guy.
But I think...I want to know what happened here.
Don't make any trouble. Please. I suggest you go.
What are you talking about? Bateman is what?
Wait. Stop. You don't seem to understand. You're not really comprehending any of this. I killed him. I did it, Carnes. I'm Patrick Bateman. I chopped Owen's fucking head off. I tortured dozens of girls. The whole message I left on your machine was true.
Why not, you stupid bastard?
That's a wonderful jacket. Let me guess, Valentino Couture?
Jesus lives, Luis.
Where are you going?
Ask me a question.
Just say no?
No. No. Be a doll and just get me a Perrier, okay?
Dorsia is...fine.
They know me.
I'm on a diet. But thank you.
Well, I'd like to travel. And maybe go back to school, but I really don't know...I'm at a point in my life where there seems lo be a lot of possibilities, but I'm so... I don't know...unsure.
Jean, do you feel...fulfilled? I mean, in your life?
A model? An actor?
Well, most guys I know who work in mergers and acquisitions don't really like it.
No. I really don't.
That's okay. I don't mind. There's something sweet about you.
Isn't it ridiculous? Coming all the way up here, but you know. They really are the best.
Come on. I think it would be a turn-on.
I've been hired by Meredith Powell to investigate the disappearance of Paul Owen.
What kind of man was he? Besides...  the information you've just given.
Hang...out?
Do you have any witnesses or fingerprints?
Actually, yes.
Well, I've had a hard time getting an actual verification. A Stephen Hughes says he saw him at a restaurant there, but I checked it out and what happened is, he mistook a Hubert Ainsworth for Paul, so...
I mean no one's dealing with the homicide squad yet or anything, right?
Eerie. Really eerie.
Uh, no. There's one...down here.
0h no. Informal conversations, mostly. What's that, Stoli?
Yeah, gone into rehab. Shame.  Is he a suspect?
Not really.
God...I guess...I was probably returning videotapes.
But...everyone orders the hash browns here. I mean- it's-have you been here before?
I'm not really sure. I had a shower...and some sorbet?
Yes. And he denies it. Though at first he couldn't be sure.
He wasn't with Paul Owen.
You reek. You reek of...shit. Do you know that?  Goddammit, Al-look at me and stop crying like some kind of faggot. Al...I'm sorry.
Oh yes. I'm very lucky.
You are a fanatic.
You don't wanna move, do you?
Then you've gotta ask him about that.
We're not gonna let it.
What would it mean, anyway? If he didn't write it?
I know, I know.
I don't know! I just know it was Teddy's code. All these ideas flying in from everywhere. You know how he says "Any kid working in his garage can put us out of business?" It's like they know what every kid's doing.
"Like this?" It's Gary you're talking about.
Milo, you told me those DOJ Agents are all over the place. How could they hope to hide a surveillance post?  And how can you get in there, anyway? With the cameras and the swipe cards --
Guilt?
Why doesn't he ask us to his party. He's never even met you.
Milo --
I went to see the Skywire model in Gary's office. You know. Just to hold it again.
Right. Wait. A toast.
Beggar. We're at a disadvantage with Outpost. Our experts aren't as smart as theirs. Sometimes we can't tell which technologies pose the threat of a monopoly. We need a really smart guy to help us pick our fights. I'm taking a shot in the dark, here. I can offer you 32,000 a year, a Buick. I'm hoping you've got a feeling it's the right thing to do.
Yes sir. I need to talk to you.
Let me look into it, see what's being done. Frankly, it's not my area.
What?
Isn't there a stigma? Bankrolling this guy?
You would? Wow. When would we come?  'Think he hung up.
There's a rumor going around, maybe you've heard it.
Skywire.
Maybe I'm going too fast.
What would you tell the kids? At your new school? You had to come up with a good story, right?
...Worse?
Wait... He knows.
What?
You do?
It's only meaningful when you've got 40,000 lines of code to back it up.
Those really weird, short lines.
...Something like that. Yeah.
Long story. Not that interesting.
You'd have to design a graphic interface to make the data pop. Maybe some audio, too. To tie it all in to Gary. How long would that take you?
"A beautiful geek? What're the chances?"
He doesn't know about the Day Care.
That's lame, isn't it?
She called to apologize. I said I was pulling an all-nighter. She said then come home just to say Hi. Which I always do when we fight, it's suspicious if I don't.
There's nothing in this hall. Someone's pulling your chain, as usual.
'Milk, milk, lemonade.  Round the corner fudge is made.  Stick your finger in the hole, And out comes a tootsie roll!'
To my health.
Damn. What exactly do you do at Virtucon?
Good luck, Austin.
Thank you.  Let's go, baby!
You might also experience a slight fever, dry mouth, and flatulence at moments of extreme relaxation. Austin, this is Commander Gilmour, Strategic Command, and General Borschevsky, Russian Intelligence.
Thanks.
Oh, and Austin...
Thank you, Basil.
Oh, and Austin...
Hey, Mick!
That's why right now is a very groovy time, man. We still have freedom, but we also have responsibility.
Not really. Kill the little bastard. See what I care.
That's fascinating, Vanessa. Listen, why don't we go into the back and shag?
Do I make you horny? Randy, you know. To you, am I eros manifest?
Oh, I forgot to tell you, they're prescription X-ray glasses. I have very bad astigmatism.
I never forget a pussy... cat.
I don't get it.
Well, you know... cows, and shagging.
Go! Just go!
Well they should, filthy beggars, they go from port to port.  Alotta meant nothing to me.
It's a shame he wasn't more headstrong.
I can explain. They attacked me. Gas came out of her...well, and then they... and I...
Behave!
It says here, name Danger Powers.
Here, have a piece of gum.
Is it one of ours?
It appears to be in the shape of Bob's Big Boy, sir.
In many ways, Bob's Big Boy never left, sir. He's always offered the same high quality meals at competitive prices.
What's its current position?
Right. Okay. Moving on.
Yes.
I haven't seen you my whole life and now you show up and want a relationship? I hate you!
An evil petting zoo?
But what if he escapes? Why don't you just shoot him? What are you waiting for?
One more peep out of you and you're grounded. Let's begin.
You didn't...
Why?
I just don't see it.
Seriously?
Secret ...
I have an appointment.
You and I. Together. But first you must confront your greatest enemy. Who could that be, Mrs. Peel? The answer is obvious ...
After the cold war ...
Watch me.
Next assignment?
I'll never marry you.
Dyed in the wool. But I can admire someone who doesn't play by the rules.
Rules are made to be broken.
Or half cocked.
You should be dead.  How do you feel?
Why should they think that?
I should have thought that was obvious ...  I'm in mourning.
How on earth can you tell?
Is that written in his shoe?
That's what we were working on.
Then a mad millionaire. Head of a secret defense establishment. A group of eccentrics obsessed by weather ...
According to Dr. Darling, you're a psychopathic personality with schizophrenic delusions, suffering from recurring amnesia based on traumatic repression, leading to outbursts of anti-social and violent behavior.  Q.E.D.
Winning isn't everything.
Shall we?
But --
It's the latest thing, Mrs. Peel.
I'm no spy -- where do I fit in?
I know all this.
It was you who gave Valentine Peel his security clearance ... you're the mole who betrayed the Ministry.
Well, you found me. Have a sniff of this, why don't you? Careful, the scent can be overpowering ...
Perhaps I'd better start calling you doctor again, Mrs. Peel --
Anyone particular in mind?
You.
I feel sure of it.
You don't say.  Like looking for a needle in a ...
This way ...
Ask not for whom the telephone rings ...
Really -- you went with him for two years.
Bobbie, what are you talking about?
He's not gonna be happy. And your parents can't be too thrilled either.
I forgot to tell you. Yesterday I found a bunch of pornos in the back seat of O'Neill's car.
Yeah. What is it?
Too bad, man, that blows my chance to be Ambassador to France.
When do the girls get to the party?
The best.
I'm very happy for you two.
Maybe it had something to do.
Yes, sir.
Cole, I'm marrying Rick.
Not as much fun as the bachelor party the guys are throwing for me.
You better not have too much joy.
Debbie, men are pigs -- if they can have women, we can have men.
Okay. Nice to meet you both.
Your whores never showed up.
Hey. I'm sorry. You want girls. I'll give you girls.
Isn't he incredible, gets along with everybody.
All right, gentlemen, I'm not gonna sugar-coat this thing. I've known you guys since grade school, so I'm gonna give it to you straight from the hip... right from the shoulder... without beating around the bush... Nothing fancy, just the plain, hard facts... tell it like it is.
Not one minute longer or Milt will come for you.
Good.
No, she hates me... I want to end everything here... now.
I see what you mean... You're a beautiful guy. And you're doing a damn good job.
No, Brett, I...
She probably had sex scheduled for 12:30. O'Neill, let's pick up the guys for a drink... I have major news to announce.
C'mon. I insist.
My gift to you.
This is your bachelor party. You haven't had sex with anyone yet.
I got something you can't resist. I have a friend, Tracey. She wants to meet you. She loves to please.
What's this?
You won't miss a thing about being single... The wild parties, the different girls every night, running around like a maniac... God, I miss that.
Great.  I was wondering, how do you guys go to the bathroom in that thing?
Yeah. Who'd have thought they'd both be a size 138 regular.
-- You know what Swayzak would do to the department if this got out? --
What is it with you, man, huh? How do you manage to keep coming up with new and amazing ways to screw up? That scotch bullshit? Am I really supposed to believe you came crawling back home because you suddenly felt heart strings moan for the family biz? You were bankrupt, man.
-- I was doin' it! I was up there fucking doin' it. You don't know, man, you don't know what I did!
Yeah, it's just another memory in my life right now. And I got way too many of them...
I saw it before it got them. I tried to yell, but... He asked me to look out for him. And I didn't do it. I let him die.
I'll handle it.
Thanks for calling.
Carrying Swayzak's notebook?
Bullshit. Marty's plan is only about efficiency. I've got two cousins on the job, you think I'd work for him if I didn't believe in it?
Brian, do you always have to be so stupid? Think about your future for once.
See that trap door up there? That used to lead to the hay loft when they had horse-drawn engines. It was pretty different then... but kinda the same, y'know?
You told Swayzak about our arson lead. It's all over the fucking news.
You knew what we were asking you to do. Don't suddenly pull out a conscience now. The fit isn't right.
Hi.
Y'know, four years ago I was working in a bakery. Two years ago I was bringing Marty coffee and he didn't even know my name. I run that office now. Marty believed in me and I believe in him. You want me to just throw that away?
What'll you do?
I want another shot, Sir.
If you remember, sir, my test scores were in the top --
Glass?
-- Another backdraft.
Some people say you don't do much of anything when it comes to this case.
Four months?
There's no replacement 'cause of your boss' cuts, if that's what you mean. If someone else goes out on an injury we're really screwed.
Didn't offer the kinda growth and challenge I need.
Management were pin heads.
You know, I've got a perfect little spot here for "Brian McCaffrey, Fireman"...
Brian. He's not doing it right, dad. He never does it right.
Well, let's have a look.
Cute.
He's going to be a fireman.
The great communicator.
I treated you better.
What's wrong, Stephen?  C'mon, you only beat up the roof when something's on your mind.  How's Brian doing?
Stephen... I... can I talk to you a second...
Putty? On both doors?
He works for me.
Jesus, open your eyes! Seagrave, Cosgrove, and now Holcomb -- fried in a goddamn high-rise!
This'll only take a minute. There's two cops outside that want to ask you about this --
Who said anything about the fucking street. I've got more connects than you have, Lieutenant...
I'm not talking about the fucking Church. Fuck the Church. But tell me. Do you believe in God?
He wants to know who brought in the chalice.
The rich kind.  Jeez, man. The way you smoke that shit is suicide.
He's gonna kill you, man. Do you hear me, motherfucker? You. Dead. Get it?
I also thought of that bread, Father. And of that night six days ago when the Mother Superior died, and I kept the cool, damp cloth on her forehead freshly moist. Father, what would you do if you had but one day in which to use your legs to serve God?
I'm on it.
We know.  We know.  Yo, check it, my black brothers, we can't let this slide.  Not this injustice. Nah, no way.  Dem' two real coons iz ill.
Yo Black, you looking for trouble.
I'm gonna start a chant and I want y'all to follow me.  Let's make our own 2 real coons know you're ready to start the show.
Alright.  Here we go.  Let's go NIGGERS!  LET'S GO NIGGERS!
Delacroix.
No shame in ya game.  She got ya nostrils, ya chnoz is wide open. Sloan's what we certified ladies' men call low hanging fruit.
You'd try anything.  I got first dibs.  You get ya own stuff.
Good.  I've got a broken back from carrying you all these years anyway.
De-la-croix.
And this is Manray.
We might need some mo' money behind this.
Yo, you gotta show some patience. You want me to snap my fingers and presto chango - you're an overnight sensation.  Son, there is no such thing.
To what?
You're now Mantan.
I won't do it anymore.
Are you trying to excuse our Holocaust?
NIGGER.  NIGGER.  NIGGER.  NIGGER.
I'm an oreo, a sell out?  Because I don't aspire to do HOMEBOYS FROM OUT OF SPACE, SECRET DIARY OF DESMOND PFEIFFER, A PJ's or some as you might put it, some "nigger" show?  I'm a Tom?  I'm whiter than white and you're blacker than black? Is that what you think?
Mantan and Sleep 'n Eat.  Two real coons.  I know we're way out there but it's satire.
Yep, you guessed it.
So what.  We would just give the NAACP a donation that would be the end of that.  No such thing as bad publicity.  So what.  Earlier you said singing and dancing.
Who are the other characters?
Ya first bad move.  Projects been done.  That's one of the problems now, everything, movies, TV, are set in the urban jungle, da hood. That's so tired.  Mantan's Millennium Minstrel Show should be set on a plantation.  In Alabama. 
I want a hot, young white director. Maybe the kid, that pheenom who just did that hot new sexy Madonna video.
That's exactly my point.  Has he even directed actors before in anything?
Calm down, please.
We just punched it up a bit.  Made it funnier.
This has to be a big mistake.
It's me, Peerless.
The same old, same old.  Trying to get my stuff through.
How can this be?  You and me at the same time, the exact same thought. It's scary.
I feel like somebody hit me upside da head with a sledgehammer.
Break a leg.
I'm sorry, I can't help it.  It's too funny.
How so?
You're the one that put us together. We're friends.
He's just playing big brother.
Please don't go there.
Dunwitty and I feel you've been getting too close to him, getting his mind all messed up.
Light?
The first and only time.  A big mistake.  I'm gonna have to ask you not to see Mantan anymore.
Pressure?  DeLa, you don't know what the hell real pressure is. SHEEETT!!!  This is lightstuff. Now when you scramblin' out on the street in da January winter and the hawk is talkin' to you with NO money and NO prospects of money anytime soon, now that there is some pressure.
Sloan, will you take your boss out of here so I can get ready.
Yeah.
I don't believe it.
You hear me talkin' to you.  The only time you come up here when something is wrong.
Peerless, I didn't raise a buffoon. We have enough of those on television already.
Peerless, last time, go see your father.
You know how your Daddy is.
I just turned twenty.
Thank you for correcting my ignorance.  I'm looking forward to working side by side with you.  I feel we make a good team.
Thank you very much.  I always try my best.
First, I would like to say I love the show.  It's very courageous. My parents marched in Selma, Alabama with Dr. King.
You've never had any formal training, either?
You sing and dance?
Are you and him kicking it? Knocking boots. Y'knowwhatI'mtalkin'bout.
Tavis, thank you for having me.
Don't you feel that is a simplistic retort?
Our Alabamy Home.  Now we're getting countrified.  We is Bama's.
Oh her.
...dat's too much money.  I can't 'ford it.  I needs me a dress that cost no mo' than...
...like macaroni and cheese...
Well, I'll be an Alabama porch monkey's uncle.
Mantan, dat sho' is a whopper.
Just a little something' somethin'.
Gots no intention of ending up broke.
Maybe you need to start.
I just don't want you and Cheeba to get hurt.
Worked my black ass off, first as an intern, then worked my way up to this position.
Not at all, sir.  I have a pair of good pistols that have already done execution, and are ready to do it again.
I'll tell you what it is, Mr. Dugan. I have had enough of Miss Dugan here and your Irish ways.  I ain't used to 'em, sir.
The people are great farmers, as well as inn-keepers.
Your loyalty to me and your service to the regiment has pleased me very well -- and now there is another occasion on which you may make yourself useful to us; if you succeed, depend on it, your reward will be your discharge from the army, and a bounty of 100 guineas.
Faith, I think you are a lad that's likely to keep your word.
Well, if it must be, it must.  For a young fellow, you are the most bloodthirsty I ever saw.  No officer, bearing His Majesty's commission, can receive a glass of wine on his nose, without resenting it -- fight you must, and Best is a huge, strong fellow.
I'll match any man with the sword.
I had news of you in Dublin.  Faith, you've begun early, like your father's son, but I think you could not do better than as you have done. But why did you not write home to your poor mother?  She has sent half-a-dozen letters to you in Dublin.
Mrs. John Best!  Was there another Mr. John Best?!
He has paid off your uncle's mortgage.  He gave Dorothy a coach- and-six.  That coward of a fellow has been making of your uncle's family.  Faith, the business was well done.  Your cousins, Michael and Harry, never let him out of their sight, though he was for deserting to England, until the marriage was completed, and the happy couple off on their road to Dublin.  Are you in want of cash, my boy?  You may draw upon me, for I got a couple of hundred out of Master Best for my share and, while they last, you shall never want.
I have heard of them.
Ten thousand?  But the scoundrel owes me seventy thousand.
All Europe shall hear of this!
Yes, sir.
For whom else have you worked?
I'd give five years of my life to see the old country again, the greenfields, and the river, and the old round tower, and the burying place.
Have no fear.  It will come out well for me.
But, if they send you away, then what is to become of me?
To risk one's life against such people is an imposition.
Very well!  Now that I know it, I will no longer love her.
That is a trifle strong.
Have you had one?
How can I believe that there is not a man who has inspired desires in you?
But if, when I love, I am unhappy, I will know that my empty heart was my good fortune.
You will do as you please.  It seems to me that such a matter can hardly be discussed until after people know each other.  Do you not agree?
Sir William Cosgrove is a man who is dying, and yet I envy him more than any man in Christendom.  He enjoys a privilege of which I am deprived. He may take you in his arms whenever he pleases, and no veil keeps his senses, his eyes, his soul from enjoying your beauty.
As soon as I saw you loved me, I was pleased, and I gave you every opportunity to fall more in love with me, being certain that, for my part, I would never love you.  But after our first kiss, I found that I had no power over myself.  I did not know that one kiss could matter so much.
Old fool!
When is he to go?
Everything -- my purse, containing upwards of a hundred guineas, my jewels, my snuff-boxes, watches. And all because this blundering coward fell to his knees...
I am prepared to accept the terms, Mr. Newcombe.
Mister Bracegirdle said to me that he had heard her ladyship lives in some fear of her life, and meditated a separation, in which case, she might later repudiate any documents signed by herself while in durance, and subject them, at any rate, to a doubtful and expensive litigation. They were quite insistent on this point, and said they must have absolute assurance of her ladyship's perfect freewill in the transaction before they would advance a shilling of their capital.
But I will have it on my birthday, won't I?
What the devil?  What kind of fools do we have here?  Pottle, who told the lad this story?
I beg your pardon?
He wants to step into my shoes!  He wants to step into my shoes!
Sir, let those laugh that win.
You know that was like a quadruple negative?
Yeah, if you've slept.
Don't you mean "don't need no liquor license not taken away from me"?
It was the grenade you fucking idiot. Look at him!
None of that matters now. We got two dead bodies and a story that explains them. You're either with us, or against us -- which is it?
Can anybody hear me!
What do you mean, alone?
Well, it's a game of anticipation, that's the beauty.
They're dead, aren't they?
That son of a bitch.
He's lying.
They would have killed us both. You want me to write a confession, I'll write a confession.
You saved Kendall's life --
But not Pike's.
Hunting -- we had to hunt him --
Yeah. Spent half his time in the infirmary. Only reason he enlisted was his father. West didn't section him till last week.
Did I ever claim I was Raymond Dunbar? Was I ever told to state my name rank and serial number for the record? No. You assumed who I was, because I was wearing this uniform. Don't believe me?
Just a guess. Maybe they're not where they're supposed to be. Maybe somebody moved them. Habeas Corpus -- no bodies, no crime, and Nunez still plays as self defense. Face it detectives... you have nothing.
Why?
But not the only victim, right?
He is not, shall we say, wild about the idea. He has asked me on numerous occasions to be more discreet about my proclivities, and I have done my best to oblige him. However, in the last four weeks, I began a relationship with another cadet. What do you think of that?
Huh. You know, I really thought you said Nunez. I thought you said "Dunbar was gone," My fault, I gotta check the tape on that.  Oh, yeah we taped the last interview. This one too. Cause it'd be a real break for us to catch you in a lie.
No, the problem is one's dead, one's got a bullet in his arm, and one won't talk. The one who won't talk was trading live fire with the dead one as we reached the pick-up.
Habeas Corpus -- you have to have a body to have a crime.
JAG gets here in three hours. Try for the confession.
Subtlety really isn't one of you finer points, is it, Osborne?
Excuse me?
Is Dunbar cute?
You're right. We should sit in silence.
You had a mobile of bayonets above your crib.
Exactly, someone who's not involved, who's word can't be questioned. You only let them see what you want them to see, you make them believe, so when the time comes, they've totally bought into your version of events.
Kendall maybe would have agreed, but the hurricane buttfucks the cabin --
Little bit.
What Kendall said -- "the type of guys you don't feel comfortable going to sleep around." That's what Dunbar said about Childs to the letter.
Right back where we started.
Want company?
Oh, you remember now --
I'm about two seconds away from seeing if fairies really can fly --
What the fuck happened to you? One minute you're next to me and the next you're gone and the sky lights up like fucking Christmas --
Shut up!
Ma'am, Ray Dunbar's black.
Then it's unofficial.
It's too neat.
Those who I deem unworthy to pass through this camp will quit, and those who refuse to quit I will kill. You ever hear of a training accident -- give me a sir, yes, sir!
I know her uncle. Friends of the family.
Kid, you were a big fish in a small pond. This here is the ocean, and you're drowning. Take my advice and go back to Puddleville. You'll be happy there.
There's only one I want.
Not yet.
I'll go in right now and get that eye.
Then do it.
Don.
Thirty years. Maybe more.
I'm eight. That means when I'm eighteen, you'll be 28. And when I'm 28, you'll only be 38.
I'm not convinced you should be happy.
I see. I thank you for your time.
And from the moment I saw her until the moment I die, she's the only one.
You don't need a picture. Just look up handsome in the dictionary.
Will never told you that?  Probably just as well. He would have told it all wrong anyway. All the facts and none of the flavor.
That poet, Norther Winslow did. He was going to Paris, France. He must have liked it, because no one ever heard from him again.  Tell you what. You take the other way and I'll cut through here. Meet you on the far side.
There's a lot you don't know about me.
You're right.
Can we talk?
The thing about icebergs is you only see 10 percent of them. The other 90 percent is below the water where you can't see it. And that's what it is with you Dad. I'm only seeing this little bit that sticks above the water.
Yourself. Good, bad, everything. Just show me who you are for once.
How what happens?
No, it's logical if you think like your father. See, to him, there's only two women: your mother and everyone else.
Yes.
They met at Auburn.
But it's romantic.
Ruth McHibbon offered to pick you up at the airport.
You didn't need to do that. You just didn't.
How is that possible? I mean, you try to ask him a question and suddenly it's another one of his stories.  You can't honestly say you know him.
Heavens no. We had a hard enough time keeping the mortgage on this place.
You know what for.
Such as?
Hang on hang on, sorry, but like, who are you?
Right.
So I come to England with other actors to make shows, I meet this freak from Novgorod I tell him of you and Chicken and the birthday here we are.
He says why did you send to Russia for a wife.
It's makes it easier. Okay.
I'm going to drink my coffee. Then, we're going to the police station. Where there will be lawyers, loss of job, house, humiliation, gutter press, and probably prison.
They don't blame you. When a bank employee does this they understand. You get your life back. Anyway I bet you hated that bank.
So you're just going to be vindictive
I'm going to be sick. Where's the...
Yes.
I don't have any money.
I don't want to talk about him.
But, you know, so what?
What's a moral orgasm John? Tell me how it feels exactly.
Whereas "Wet 'n' Wild" is an emotional journey. "Tied and Tethered". It's pretty moving huh? Like Anna Karenina.
So now you hate all women?
Get out
You are throwing me out.
Get out.
It's none of your business. She didn't have small eyes.
Laugh it up.
It's alright.
I'm not asking you to marry me.
Yeah, I know.
I already tossed that out.  Somethin' you should'a done to that woman long ago... how she treated you. Of course, that's none of my business.
Well that's good. I'm happy to hear it.
You liked what I brung ya?
Don't gotta tell me. Me and my girlfriends use-ta talk 'bout them hard fingertips he got pickin' that guitar.
You ain't the kicker, are you?
Can I put it in your mouth?
Some women prefer not to scent their bodies with perfume. So now they have scented creams. They help moisturize a woman's skin.  This one's my favorite. It's called Ginger Souffle. I recommend... applying the cream while the skin is still damp. So... perhaps just after a shower.
I bet you did. Just had to get that black cock up in you. I swear to God. What Ronnie sees... you disgust me.
Rose... please...
If we get with a counselor. At the church, maybe they's...
Let go...
Or what? OR WHAT?
Test. Shit. What kind'a test you thinkin'? You mean like, if you a man or not? If you a killer? Only one way to prove that. You just look me in the eye, boy, and you squeeze that trigger back.
Yes. I mean that's it. I wanna feel like a man with her. I wanna feel like the only man with her.
Think it'd be best if you stayed put while we talk.
The fuck you been doin' to me?
Whose doin' is that?
I CAN'T!
Gal, I been around hard-cursin' folk all my life. And let me tell you...
Well, get to it.
No one's gonna hurt you no more.
I tried.
Looks like you know a song.
Get a good picture in your mind.
Word wit'cha. In private.
Why you say that?
What'chu sayin'?
This ain't got nothin' to do with that woman. Just don't want nobody around me now.
Got no place for preachin' here. Not now. So you do as I say...
I'm tellin' you the truth, dammit. I found her beat. Left for dead. So I brung her home.
THIS IS HOW YOU HANDLING IT? THIS IS HOW YOU HANDLING IT?
What? I called Bojo, like you say. Called up the fellas in the band...
The fuck are all these people doin' here? Been drinkin' in this shit hole for years ain't seen this many people since I don't know...
Get me ten bags of mulch.
Well, dig in, son. Got plenty to eat.
Rae, look at Ronnie. And tell him how you feel.
Rae don't do this now...
Are you wasted?
Yeah.
No. That's not why...  Why we always gotta do this? I mean, you and me been at each other as far back as I can remember. Wasn't no love between us. And I'm your daughter. I'm the only family you got.
Thought you had a man for that.
Just a cough. Sugar and a spoonful of Jack'll do it.
Let go...
Charlie...
Where is the subway station, please.
Go to sleep, Charlie.
Cool?
All right, how's the new partner?
The mayor's office, under the bed, the back room at Lombardi's.  And call me Ich.
What's the problem here?
Yeah...
You toler -- yes, tolerate me.
I'll check it out.
Let's go.  Him first.
Not now, man, okay, not now.  Work with me.
What do you chant?
This little guy thinks you're Robert Redford... the other one thinks you're Charles Bronson...
The cheese...
Might be different in New York.
Maybe.  If I come visit, we can find out.
Why?
What?
Right.
You're foreigners.
Work with me.  I want your best detective.
The young are eating the old, something that usually doesn't happen here.
-- Do you know where she is, detective?  Do you know how to find her?  Even where to start?  We will find them.
I want him.
The families who control the casinos?
Yes.  Unlike our syndicates, your criminals don't understand the words 'honor' and 'duty'... We can't afford not to deal with them.
The other plate is currently in New York, in the hands of Kobo's man. Find it for me.
Mr. Sebastian is a host who wants to be appreciated.  We'll appreciate him and he'll cooperate.
Where?
Anywhere.
And what can he do for you?
Come here.
I am?
Oh, no bother, I'd be glad to.
You're just all so... so different.
I don't know much about biomechanics, Roy.  I wish I did, but you're out of my league.
Garbage man?
Then let her get away.  I thought you were a pro -- you're supposed to be a fuckin' tracker!
Never mind.  Do they have that knowledge?
It's okay.  Forget it.
My pleasure.
Well, you don't have to worry about getting it wrinkled.
Of course.
What shows?
I don't know nothing about it.
Can you?  I couldn't.
You did?
You didn't hear me.  You were sleeping.
Dead.
I don't know... I think I missed something.
Don't be fooled by appearances.
Good for a smart girl to feel stupid.  Part of your education.
Andies only simulate suffering -- if they're programmed for it.
Next time you go on vacation, do me a favor, let us know where it is.
I'm tired of this.
Don't move.
But how come I'd be there?
I was tired and didn't have any place to go.
I don't have one.
They left.
Just better.
Thanks.
My glands.  They grow old too fast.
As a matter of fact I did.  They've got some work to do tonight, but they're gonna come tomorrow.
You're all so perfect.
My office.
How 'bout a drink at the bar?
Oh, brother...
See? I'm psychic. Not completely, but pretty much. That was pretty good, wasn't it?!
Get away from me!!
Heck, no!  What?!
It's Webber.  Adam Webber.
I know a short-cut.
No.
Cross my heart and hope to die.
Doing what?
Two weeks.
Who are these people?
What?
You know, Eve -- don't get mad, okay? - -  but, I'd just be lost without you.
I don't want to be alone.
No dogs, huh? Okay.
Well, I could probably get you laid in two weeks, but to locate a non-mutant wife from Pasadena...that could take some time.
Stop that ma'am crap!
I like it.
He's a former boyfriend. We lived together for about six months.  And yes, I'll admit it.  I've still kind of got a thing for him.  That's what you wanted to know, isn't it?
Have you ever heard the saying, "He hasn't got enough sense to come in out of the rain?"
Would you do it just because you're my friend? My very best friend.
Not that one!
Yes, I have a dictionary. But I can't understand for the life of me why you would call her that!  Or why Cliff would say that about you.
Why are you suddenly so mad at me?
No.  I admire you.  I...I fell in love with you the first time I saw you.  I did. I think that you are the most--
I know first aid!
But it just wasn't where I wanted to be so I left as politely as I could and found a taxi.  But I asked the driver to drop me here instead of at the hotel.  There's a song Mister Como sings called "On the Street Where You Live."  You know it?
Neat. Goodnight!
Nothing.
I know it has been terrible.  But it wasn't your fault. And now all the decay is over with and things are going to get better. You understand?
What's baseball?
No, son. A pitcher.
No. Sit down.
Because he's forced out at third! It's a force!
One more thing. If you find a healthy young woman, bring her back with you.
Positive. The Soviet Union collapsed without a shot being fired. The Cold War is over.
Yes. That's kind of how it was.
What are you talking about? This is the new Mac. You a hacker?
I'm not wearing his pants.
Amazing. I'm very impressed.
You bet!
Does that work?
Yeah...Seems to.
And thanks for always being happy!
The hotel.
How old do I look?
Up here on the fifteenth floor?
Frozen, they're six-thirty a dozen in the three pound box.
You could have a meat order that big delivered to your home.
Oh, my holy stars! A Negro!
I do alright.
Yes, ma'am.
Calm down, please. This man needs help and you need protection from him. That's obvious.
Well, he and Mrs. Nutcase must have been out here when the plane hit.
Yeah.
I've read up on it. I'll deliver the baby myself if I have to.
The locks.
To keep us from trying to leave. After an atomic blast there's a radiation half-life that lasts thirty five years.
Hot Dr. Pepper! Your favorite!
How could you?! This is just like home!
Coming!
You know, when we do go up...I'm going to miss this old place. How 'bout you, hon?
Oh, yes.  It just fascinates me how all    these things work.
Yes, dear, I know.
For him. It doesn't work for the rest of us.
Eve?!
Those sluts!
Yes, you do.
Well, consider the source. I don't even know what a lady is.
I don't know.  Everything's so neat. It's all just so...goddamn dear.  Damn!
See these?  Found them in the box with the cards.  These are stock certificates.  IBM.  AT&T.  Polaroid.
You didn't stop anywhere else?!
Um...uh...
I'm not sick.
Well, I haven't seen any. I wouldn't worry about it. Look, I better go.
Darling, where are the glasses? Oh, here they are.
Right Ben. LET'S GO FUCK. I'll fuck anything that moves.
The criminals are winning.
I won't let the bastards get me up against the wall. It's an act of defiance.
It's blue. Blue velvet.
Does Dorothy know her husband is dead?
Jeffrey nothing.
Nothing. Are you alright?
I'll go then.
It's okay. It's okay.
You can kiss them if you want. Feel them. They're getting hard.
OK.
That's not crazy. I like you too.
Same here.
I can't. I can't. You think you know so much.
Don? Are you in with them?
That's good.
No police!!!  No police!!
Men are crazy. Then they put their craziness into me. Then it makes me crazy. Then they aren't so crazy for awhile. Then they put their craziness in me again.  It's burning me, but I love you. I do, I do. Did you know that? Did you know that I love you?
Who, Dorothy?
Don? Where is he?
Mommy's here.
Come on, Frank. Let's go. Please.
Yeah. I sure know that. Yeah, but how many more are out there?
Right here Frank. You want me to pour it?
I've made arrangements with Dr. Gynde for 10:30. But Jeffrey, you'll have to walk over; I need the car this morning.
Jeffrey, when you see your father.
It would be too much for him. So please let him think as he does, that you're home just to see him.
Do you want the car?
Alright.
I just wanted to ask him a few questions, that's all. Maybe I better go.
Sure thing, please don't worry about me. Can I help you with the dishes?
Yeah. What are you doing now?
That's too bad.
It's not bad, but it's bad enough. It's a lot worse for my father.  I used to know a kid who lived there and who had the biggest tongue in the world.
I don't know. He moved away.
Right out in the car I happen to have some old overalls and a bug spraying rig. I will go to her apartment and be the pest control man. I will spray her apartment. After a few minutes you will knock on her door, drawing her attention away from me and I will then jimmy a window.
I didn't get a good look at him either, but he sure looked at me. I didn't have time to get a window, but I found this key.  Pretty nifty, huh?
Look, it can wait till Sunday.
Well, I've found out some things, nothing really for certain. There are some strange people involved.
You're sure right. It is a strange world.
I guess so. You want to help me watch Frank? I'm going to stake out Frank's place tomorrow with a camera.
Number two. I saw the Yellow Man come out. This time with a well- dressed man with an alligator briefcase. They drove down this factory building and stood on a staircase looking at something in the distance. Number three. Now get this. In the distance was a murder. A drug dealer shot to death and a woman with her legs broken.
Jeffrey!!
You like mysteries that much?
Yeah, you're a mystery. I like you. Very much.
You didn't tell him about me?
It's good to see you.
Just a minute.
No.
Yes.
Okay. Let's get her over to your father's.
You can change it if you want to.
Okay.
Up where?
Aye.
Look under the body.
You sound real remorseful.
Well... what if your boss knew how many guys were supposed to be there... in that room?
He knows you, man. He knows all you want is to move up. That's all. A smooth hitter woulda gone in there, seen it was a wash and slipped out. But a guy like you? Knowin' this is your only chance? Waitin' eighteen years?
Oh, what the fuck? How do you guys decide who you're... I mean, who makes the cut? Is there a raffle or something?
C'mon!
What?  What, that guy?
This guy is very sharp. If he hasn't figured us out yet, he will.
Connor, is that you?
Ma, what's wrong?
Pull the trigger?! Have ya lost it woman?! Now just calm down here.
Well, I didn't but...
They had some pretty interesting bandages. Know anything about that?
Know any other languages?
An F.B.I. agent came by the bar. He left me his c-c, he left me his c-c, he left me this.
me up the...
How many?
Lord have mercy. That was a good one ma.
Okay. We're ready.
I don't know they just always need it.
All right, get the stupid fuckin' rope.
We'll find it. Just calm down.
Sh, sh! Fuck you!
It is your corrupt we claim.
Yeah?
Fan-fuckin-tastic!
Can she I.D. them?
They were wearing masks.
Rocco!
Yeah. Some cultures still put pennies in the eyes of the dead, or silver.
The Greeks. The Italians.
Crime of passion. He just went nuts. He would have shot everyone in here. He just ran out of bullets.
Twist of lemon!
Respect is earned, Greenly, never given. Guys like you should have to follow me around squabbling for the scraps from my table.
Who were the victims?
I...
We're like 7-Eleven. We ain't always doing business, but we're always open.
Yeah. Anybody call for me?
Yeah. Anybody call for me?
You know them personally?
I'm sorry you're gonna hafta see this. Don't look at me!
I'm sorry, I'm sorry. I didn't see.
How long since your last confession, my son?
Yeah boss?
What does Starsky say?
This is he?
She's an attractive older woman.
I know about money, Anthony. I know the value of money. Plus the earrings are worth three times that.
Every valuable item in the house was on that list.
Dignan, it's got an alarm.
That sets it off.
No, just do it real quick.  I'll meet you down there.
That's a good question. No. I don't. I'm just being hypocritical here. However, I will say --
We got it. We got it.
Anthony, he sat in the car and watched a 4-11 in progress. He got what he deserved.
He was the driver, Dignan. He did what he's supposed to do.
Because my mom gets the bill.
Dignan, those aren't running shoes.
Yes, they are.
Look at the treads on those.
They obviously weren't designed for racing.
It's a great shirt. Don't worry about it.
I know. But once you get inside you're home free.
No, no. Look. OK. Let's stay here until we find out what's going on.
Don't worry about it, Bob.
Where was it parked?
Maybe he just went to the store.
So when you were saying Bob's at the store and acting real surprised, that was just an act. You were just --
If you say so.
OK.
I know we can. It's real simple. We go into a room, grab some car keys and --
Look. I'm ready to get the fuck out of here. It's real torture for me to be here. Getting the shit kicked out of me by Mexicans.
I'm not. But there's --
She needed it.
Right now.
Hopefully this trip'll go a little smoother than the last one.
I don't want to be too much of a liability.
As a person?
Roger.
Where's Kumar?
Come on, Kumar.
I don't think so.
Pretty much everything.
We haven't heard from Applejack since he got out of the hospital. His case got dismissed.
It belongs to Bob's uncle.
It's called a racquet, Anthony, and you're holding it wrong. That's ghetto play. Hold it like this.
So do I.
I don't think you're giving him enough credit. I know sometimes he doesn't think an idea through. He gets too excited. But --
The Abe Henry double-cross test. You just made a perfect score.
Death.
Can I ask you something, Mr. Henry?
Oh, yeah. They'll never catch the guy.
He looked too shaken-up.
I'm not playing any more golf.
Yeah, but he still has the aggravation. Three days sitting in a cell.
The front stairs.
Yeah.
OK, Bob.
Six thousand dollars? Come on, Bob.
I can't believe you said that.
I do blame you, Bob. And woah. Look at her.
That's my responsibility.
Yeah, but what if some nut pulled gun on you?
His name was Swifty?
I'm putting a piece of tape on my nose.
Shhh. Slow down, Bob. Drive natural.
No. I was calm.
Bob, I've got nightmares.
It's registered in my mother's name.
Well, the marijuana crop is a good start.
Since when is it a crime to have a scale in your house? Everybody has a scale.
Not in that car you're not.
Dignan. You're going to give me those keys or you're going to get hurt.
Don't threaten me, Bob.
OK, Bob. I don't know his name. You know why? Because I don't care. He's Future Man. But I care about you. And to me it doesn't make sense to go back to the scene of a crime. Will you get in the car, Bob? This is stupid.
I don't expect an apology and I don't even want one. I just want us to --
Bob, you're lying!
Yeah?
I think so.
I don't really want to talk about it, Bob.
Wait a second --
Hard to find it sitting by the pool drinking beer and bullshitting.
John, I'm twenty-six years old I didn't run away from home.
She Chicano, yes?
What?
Will it track back to us?
Go to the airport. Get a plane. I'll have a brass band waiting for you.
What are you after, Pam? You want to fry me? You want my desk? Is that it?
...At the time of his death, Conklin was sitting on a personal account in the amount of seven-hundred and sixty thousand dollars.
So what's your theory?  Conklin's reaching out from the grave to protect his good name?  The man is dead.
Jesus... I, Zorn... I have to call his family. Tell them...
I'd rather stand if it's all the same to you.
I'm not a traitor. I've served my ountry.
There were two charges, they were supposed to go off simultaneously. The second one, the one that didn't go off, was down here...  First of all, this is nothing, it's a sub-line for the breaker above. Second, why put the charge all the way down here? If you're good enough to get in here and handle the gear, you're good enough to know you don't need this.  Bourne would know.
That's not what happened to your parents.
Look at me.
She wouldn't let me.  She's the only reason you're alive.
-- take the back -- get another car --
Conklin up front.
But it ends up the same.
So...
Where --
-- there's places -- we can't afford to be wrong!
What?
-- hang on --
What is this, a game?
He closed down Treadstone -- he took care of me after Paris...
For Treadstone. In Berlin. You know my file. I did a job here. When?
That's a lie!
Do you think you can read? Are you well enough?
Is there. Is all there.
See, that's a problem for me, Nicky. Whatever he's doing, we need to end it. This isn't the kind of mess you walk away from.
Because he's doing just what he said he'd do. He's coming for us.
I don't know. He was sick. He wanted out. I believed him.
My brother and nephew perished two days ago, when their hay cart turned over.
I don't want to leave.
It was in Latin, sir.
Invade?! That's impossible, it --
We must sue for peace.
We cannot. Some scarcely believe you are alive. Other think you'll pay them Mornay's wages. We bid you to Edinburgh. Meet us at the city gates, two days from now, at sunset. Pledge us your pardon and we will unite behind you. Scotland will be one.
You let Wallace escape your whole army. You cannot blame me for this.
So I did! And what was so important about it?
You may.
You mock us with a smile?
Simply because he eluded your trap, do you think he is more than a man? My father is dying. Perhaps you should think of our coronation.
Probably. But we can't win alone. We know that. This is the only way.
We'll get those English pigs tomorrow.
You win.
I could crush you like a roach.
He was so brave. With courage alone he nearly won.
He broke because of me. I saw it. He lost all will to fight.
All men lose heart. All betray. It is exactly why we must make the choices we make.
No. He did not.
Some nights. I have dreams. Mostly dreams I don't want. I started riding at night to fill up my mind so that when I did sleep I'd dream only of the ride and the adventure.
York was the staging point for every invasion of my country. And that royal cousin hanged a hundred Scots, even women and children, from the city walls.
That is not possible.
Because of the way you're looking at me now. The same way... as when we met.
I have taken vows. More than one. I've vowed faithfulness to my husband, and sworn to give him a son. And I cannot keep both promises.
Sir, I... come to beg you to confess all, and swear allegiance to the king, that he might show you mercy.
Every man dies. Not every man really lives.
And I will consult with mine.
The dogs have a scent. My scent. Someone must have given it to them.
Not according to his teacher. It just got me thinking about Jason and what if Evan's inherited his father's condition?
But you must have something to go on?
Plenty. Who knows? Maybe he's got severe coping problems about not having a father. Did you say the last blackout occurred when he was with his friend's dad.
We're putting up pictures for Parent's Night.
Um... can dad come this time?
I can't help it. I'm just so proud of you. You've got the highest grades in all of your classes.
How's Kayleigh doing? She all right?
Fix?
Come on, Mom. Just 'cause Dad was my age when he started going crazy doesn't mean that I'm nuts.
You told me that on Parents' Weekend. Remember? Wait, that wasn't me. Or you.
Can you protect me?
You need to see the prison shrink, man.
I'm standing next to Kayleigh, my hands are over her ears.
Lemme guess. Would that be where the memories are stored?
But I... I need those books.
No, Evan. I don't know. It's been a long time. Fill me in.
Well, sure. I'll try to remember. Shoot.
I know, but...
Who are you trying to convince, Evan?! You come all the way out here to stir up my shit just because you had a bad memory!? You want me to cry on your shoulder and tell you that everything's all better now? Well fuck you, Evan! Nothing's gonna be all better! Okay?! Nothing ever gets better!
Mmmm... You give good compliment. Clean up and come back to bed.
As if my dad could've stopped me from seeing you. What's he gonna do to me?
What?
You wouldn't believe me. I mean, people always say, "You wouldn't believe me", but in this case, it's not even worth trying.
Because you're... different.
Let me ask you a question. Just a little one that's been gnawing at me for years.
On the bridge. How did you know that Tommy had your dog? That was no fucking hunch.
Off to change everyone's life again, is that it? Maybe this time you'll pop up in some mansion while I wind up in Tijuana doing the donkey act.
When my folks split, they gave me and Tommy a choice who we wanted to live with. I couldn't stand my dad, but I knew if I moved to my mom's I'd never see you again.
Why not? But that's not how things wound up. I'm with Lenny, Lenny's your friend. And there it ends.
Kayleigh? What happened?
Thanks. Wow. Hey, I want to do something really special for Kayleigh tomorrow. If I said I needed some help from you and the brothers...
I still owe you an essay from last week. Is there any way I could get an extension?
Sure. I was gonna make a new one, anyway.
If I hadn't blown my arms off, Mom never woulda started smoking in the first place. Now shhhh.
Get this "us" shit. As if I was gonna lay a hand on my own sister. You've done nicely for yourself, Evan. Nice friends, nice life, not to mention you're fucking my sister. Not a bad piece of ass if I say so myself.
No one thinks you're a piece of shit, Tommy.
Huh?
Yes?
Oh, he's just like any other man, only more so.
Go back to Bulgaria.
I'm sorry. It is.
Yes, Monsieur.
A champagne cocktail, please.
Oh, two weeks, maybe three.
I don't buy or sell human beings.
Suppose we do.
Oh, by the way, my agreement with Sam's always been that he gets twenty- five percent of the profits. That still goes.
And Abdul and Carl and Sacha, they stay with the place, or I don't sell.
Well, so long.
You needn't be concerned about me.
This morning you implied it was not safe for him to leave Casablanca.
That is also true, except for one destination, to return to occupied France.
No.
He hasn't played it in a long time.
Uh huh.
That's easy. There was. He's dead.
Ah, that's the new German 77. And judging by the sound, only about thirty-five miles away.
I know very little about you, just the fact that you had your teeth straightened.
No, no, no, no. We must leave.
Yes, of course, we --
Especially tonight.
Why did you have to come to Casablanca? There are other places.
Has it got a wow finish?
Last night I saw what has happened to you. The Rick I knew in Paris, I could tell him. He'd understand. But the one who looked at me with such hatred... well, I'll be leaving Casablanca soon and we'll never see each other again. We knew very little about each other when we were in love in Paris. If we leave it that way, maybe we'll remember those days and not Casablanca, not last night.
Your unexpected visit isn't connected by any chance with the letters of transit? It seems that as long as I have those letters I'll never be lonely.
I went through all that with your husband. It's no deal.
What of it? I'm going to die in Casablanca. It's a good spot for it.
But it's all right, isn't it? You were able to arrange everything?
-- Last night we said a great many things. You said I was to do the thinking for both of us. Well, I've done a lot of it since then and it all adds up to one thing. You're getting on that plane with Victor where you belong.
Won't you join us?
When I was in the concentration camp, were you lonely in Paris?
Of course, I'll be careful.
Sam?
Rick? Who's he?
Mademoiselle, you are in Rick's and Rick is --
I wasn't sure you were the same. Let's see, the last time we met --
We all try. You succeed.
I appreciate it, but I don't accept it.
I beg your pardon?
We might as well question why we breathe. If we stop breathing, we'll die. If we stop fighting our enemies, the world will die.
What of it? Then it'll be out of it's misery.
I know a good deal more about you than you suspect. I know, for instance, that you are in love with a woman. It is perhaps strange that we both should be in love with the same woman. The first evening I came here in this cafe, I knew there was something between you and Ilsa. Since no one is to blame, I, I demand no explanation. I ask only one thing. You won't give me the letters of transit. All right. But I want my wife to be safe. I ask you as a favor to use the letters to take her away from Casablanca.
But we made a deal.
No. It's all arranged.
Monsieur Blaine, I don't ask you to explain anything.
Thank you. I hope you'll forgive me, Captain, but the present French administration has not always been so cordial. May I present Miss Ilsa Lund?
No. Two champagne cocktails, please.
May we proceed with the business?
-- Thank you.
Yes, even in Berlin. If you will furnish me with their names and their exact whereabouts, you will have your visa in the morning.
Oh, we Germans must get used to all climates, from Russia to the Sahara. But perhaps you were not referring to the weather.
How do you do, Mr. Rick?
Do you mind if I ask you a few questions? Unofficially, of course.
You weren't always so carefully neutral. We have a complete dossier on you.
I have no conviction, if that's what you mean. I blow with the wind, and the prevailing wind happens to be from Vichy.
And if it should change?
Ask Monsieur Rick.
This is no ordinary arrest. A murderer, no less.
Yeah? Have a brandy?
This is the end of the chase.
I just paid out twenty. I'd like to get it back.
It doesn't matter. There is no exit visa for him.
-- Hello, Ilsa.
Another precedent gone. This has been a very interesting evening. I'll call you a cab. Gasoline rationing, time of night.
And I'm taking a friend with me. One you'll appreciate.
I'll make the arrangements right now with Laszlo in the visitor's pen.
As soon as the plane goes, Louis.
Uh huh.
I'm a drunkard.
Oh, nothing. But when you first came to Casablanca, I thought --
-- You thought what?
You are a very cynical person, Rick, if you'll forgive me for saying so.
If I gave you any thought, I probably would.
I don't mind a parasite. I object to a cut-rate one.
I don't want them here overnight.
Don't be a fool. You can't get away.
Yeah, but I ain't got time to spend the money I make here.
Yes, boss.
Take it, damn it.
But I have promises to keep.  And miles to go before I sleep.  And miles to go before I sleep.  Got to fix the sea anchor.  Use the sail.
Yeah, sure, what?
As much as anybody.
They're harder to do than they look.
Well, I do a little drawing --
No.  that was the last one.
Sure.
Had a package to deliver.
You?  Personally?
So do I.
Let's take a look.
Don't overwhelm me with details, you know how I hate that.  Did you get it fixed?
Ah, the staff meeting could have gone better.
I figure, if we could take care of a puppy, we could, you know, take care of --
You want to.
No.
There isn't any us.
Go on.  We'll be fine.  I'll feed Jango to the frogs.
I thought you might have.
That about sums it up.
Maybe now's when you tell me about it.
Yeah?
Cliches, mainly.  Don't take anyone for granted.  Don't sweat the small stuff. Live each day like it's your last.
I had to come.  To be sure you were okay.
Anything else?
And fish are very low in fat, which is energy inefficient.  So you're going to burn up your own cells no matter how much you eat.  Luckily you ate the eyes and pancreas, which contain some Vitamin C, so you didn't get scurvy.
Your body chemistry and your exposure to the elements would normally lead to irritability, depression, anxiety, periods of self-reproach.  It's almost like schizophrenia.  Different sides of your personality might come to life, speak out, act out.
Hey, once a driver, always a driver.  You want a lift?  I've just got one more pickup.
There's settled folks, and there's nomads.  You're just not a settled folk. You never belonged here.
Kamal, you're breaking up.  Can you hear us?
Can you find her?
You're looking at a Level III search. For your Level III, you gotta have E-4 authorization.  I don't have it.
You fucked us over.
I was making a point.
What?  Let Paris hold its plane?  Let Memphis take care of it?  Let somebody down the line clean up your mess?
I'm trying to help you here.  There's Warsaw, there's this --
Must have taken a hell of a long time.
To Wilson.
To life.
Believe me I know.
Being patient.  Don't rush things.  I get it.
Finish what you started.  You haven't changed, Chuck.  It's still you.
Try to think of nothing, Dorothy.
Life is waiting.
You *invented* him! You've completely made his up!
And that I can drive a truck!
I know.
People watched the movies in their cars?
But you had so much *responsibility*.
Ah-ha.  So what is that--a radio?
Nobody will swim here until next summer. By then, the water will have rubbed the glass smooth against the sand--there won't be any sharp edges.
Right.
I told her! She doesn't feel she can do that. Something about her father not letting her go anywhere...
You don't understand! It's her father...
You got up! You *did* something! If you keep this up, you might be in danger of making a *decision*!
Well, this *is* an orphanage.
Nobody ever wants me!
Nobody special enough, Curly.
Well, we can only guess about that, Edna. They *are* against the law.
*Liver* killed him?
But did you know him?
She's dead now, too. She was a nanny.
What's an immigrant?
Sure! Be glad to! Uh... a ride where?
I don't *have* any time. There's a *war*!
It's all very normal.
This is easy--I'm not hurrying.
When it comes to this, you is the real thing--is that what you sayin'?
I presume you'd prefer handling the delivery.
In other words, scurvy.
We haven't had a Wilbur here in a year or so, have we? We used to have *dozens*!
Try to look at it this way. What choice does Buster have? What are his options? Nobody will ever adopt him. 
Try to look at it *this* way. Buster and I are sitting right here beside you. We could have ended up in the incinerator! 
I wasn't intending to leave here in order to be entirely useless--I expect I'll find some ways to be of use.
Of course.
There's not a lot of work in the winter, and you'll have to tolerate Vernon--even Wally despises him, and Wally likes everyone.
We heard that one already, Homer.
I guess you must like watchin' me be sick...
Them people drinkin' that cider, they don't know there's a cigarette in there!
Does it *snow* in Bombay? One winter here and we'll be shipping him south, in a *coffin*!
I told him that you all is sick.
Uh, Maker's Mark. Rocks.
On me. For the seat. Cheers.
No, no. Nothing like that. I work in a bank.
I don't follow.
Big.Com. That Internet thing.
Right. The guys who started that did what a lot of companies in the Valley do. They get a good idea, shop it around, raise some capital, then sell it off to a bigger company. Microsoft, Intel, Oracle, whatever. The beauty of it is, they've pretty much sold the company before they're even real. The bigger company is already set to buy it, all they want to do is make sure that the idea actually works. So they get some start up capital, make it work, then sell it for like five times the initial loan.
Know who I am, Jake?
I was doing it for them.
Yes it is, Jake! Yes it is! They were right there for you. She was right there for you! Look at her!
It's like putting on a play, where everyone knows their part except for the mark.
We'll take care of it.
Let's go, Jake?
We get fifty percent. And we get clear of the King.
Stake you?
Good boy.
Well, it certainly is a coincidence. Here of all places! How is Mrs. Lewis?
LISTEN to me! We don't have much time. We can still get through this but you have to keep your head and trust me!
I gotta go get a haircut.
I think you'd do it for free. You're almost drooling. You like the rush.
Good quality porn has it's place in the world.
You guys got busted. This is a great neck.
What about the money?
Miles...
Good point.
Then what do you want to do, Miles? Run?
We never had a problem with that before.
Yeah, well we're still a little young for Albany State Prison. Are you pissed about Al? I'm pissed too, but I'm not like "twenty-five to life" pissed.
Where the hell is she?
You know, this is kind of embarrassing, but my wallet was stolen yesterday and I'm afraid the ticket was in it. But the name's Pearson.
Your buddy. That fat guy. The King couldn't wait to have that guy whacked. He didn't even know who the guy was, but he was so pissed off at him, he gets him drilled. It ain't personal. It's business.
Oh, you know... Don't fuck this up. I'll kill you. I'll kill your family. I'll shoot your dog... All the usual. Then he said good luck.
That's what I like about you, Lupus. You're a free thinker. Don't let the King tell you different.
HE GOT CAUGHT! Your boss tried to pull a switch and he got us all fucking pinched!
I don't think so. Their Fix gave us the heads up and Jake's got a plan that'll probably keep him off.
Let's just say he burned me once.
You help me catch him. Whatever he's into next, I want you to be into. And what you're into, I'm into. If it all goes well, those two guys from IAD will never have to hear this tape. I'll clear you guys of anything you've ever done with Vig under the guise of some cross- departmental investigation. This prick's been on the wish list for so long, you'll probably get gold shields out of it.
Literally. It's not a bad deal, gentleman. I get peace of mind. You get Detective Sheilds. But this is the best part, Walter... Walter, your daughter will get to keep her braces and have that winning smile. Capice?
I'll take you up on that.
Goodnight.
Well it is. But I know where I am.
Look, now I'm pumping you. I'm sorry. It's none of my business. It's just that you're not like the others.
Now he's a real shit. Don't get friendly with him. I'm sure he's got his hand in the till. You know what he said to me once? "I want to fuck the whole world over. That's my mission." The shit!
You're all scumbags.
She.
A bit unexpected, wasn't it?
I owe you for the rent. It's only a car. I can get another.
I don't know.
Haven't you got a conscience of your own?
I'm on at nine.
It's the truth.
You're entitled to your opinion.
Leave me alone, Marion.
Well I've got something for you. In London, I mean. I've been chatting to some friends. Do you know the Golden Lion casino? It's in Bayswater, I believe... They're looking for a dealer, a croupier.
Great. I've just started a new company. Solid financing. It's good.  I love you Jacko, you know that
Yes, I know that.
Well, thank you anyway.
I was born in the Transkei, on the Wild Coast.
Toss you for it.
What kind of trouble?
Was that why you did the two grand? I couldn't help you.
I don't have any money.  switches on the light. JANI is looking distressed.
And I thought you were a bright woman.
You won't be committing a crime. The man will cheat, you'll just be doing your job, that's all.
But if it does.
I'm asking you, as a...friend. You'd be saving the life of a friend.
I have to take the car.
Yes.
It's all relative.  I need the money too.
You did?
Too much. Eighteen hundred.
Turn left at the lights.
So it's Mr Clean. Wise up, Jack, this whole business is bent. The casino is nothing but legal theft. And that's OK. It's the system. Half the punters who come in are using stolen money, drug money, they haven't earned it. We earn our money.  I'm on your side, Jack. I don't need an enemy.
I don't know what that means. I'm talking about not rocking the boat.
Loosen up, Jack. If you don't, this job'll get to you. The pressure's too much, believe me, it'll break you.
"The world breaks everyone, and afterwards many are strong in the broken places." Ernest Hemingway.
Cheers. Happy New Year. I really like you, Jacko, you're so fucking straight.  Hey, you haven't changed your clothes!
It was you, you shit.
Has he?
I don't think so.
Wipe your hands.
I make it six.
I said good call.
He's a good customer.
Right, that checks out here.
Yeah.
Key? Key? What is the key?
No, no, the key, the key to the fail- safe lock!
Key?
We're gonna die, Boiler. We're gonna die.
It didn't go off.
Yoo hoo, bomb...
Well, then, everything sounds fine. We'll drop you off in thirty-five seconds. Good luck.
I am always receptive to suggestions.
Right!
That is correct.
Of course not.
...you may be doing so on the basis of false data.
-- remove thrust drive repellant --
It's funny, but I kind of sit around, you know, a lot of time to myself...
I really think I should try and locate it immediately. Might be something important.
Sh, Talby, don't bother me now.
Guess you're right.
I'm going into them, I'm going to hit them. Doolittle...
Commander, sir, we have a big problem. You see, the Veil Nebula bomb, Bomb Number 20, is stuck. It won't drop from the bomb bay. It refuses to listen and plans to detonate in --  -- less than eleven minutes.
Well, sir, the Dodgers broke up, disbanded over thirteen years ago.
What were you saying, Commander, about the bomb?
I like to keep it professional, that's all.
You haven't figured this out yet, have you?  You walk in here thinking you're gonna cap her then cap me and take the money back to your boss with your tail wagging... But see it's really the other way around.  You think I'm the whack, when actually you're the whack.
You didn't tell me you lived with her.
Where?
Thought I'd let you have first crack... Later.
Thanks, it's starting to kick in.  I feel almost human.
Whoever that is.
The one you're wearing?
So now you tracked me down.  What d'ya think?
How does Mrs. Eyes Only like being married to a guy on everybody's hit list?
Bent.
How do I know you didn't?
You're that nervous, you're welcome to stay here.
C'mon, Max.  First I watch you dive headfirst out the window fifteen stories up like you're Rocky the flying squirrel. Then, I found this in your apartment.
How much do you know?
I know they made me.  Even got the label on my neck to prove it.
I didn't make it this far by attracting a lot of attention.
They want me...bad.  Or at least they don't want me grabbed up by the Chinese or whoever.  Best case, I wind up back in that facility.  More likely, it's a long drive out in the country, if you know what I mean.
Look, thank you for this but--
You don't want to.
A friend of your fiance's.
My name's Lydia.  And it seems you and I have a lot in common.
And so should you.  Sketchy told me I could expect a visit from you.  I know all about how you threatened him.  That if he didn't break it off with me, you'd save him the trouble.
How sweet.  Standing by your man, even after what he did.  You're a very understanding person.
He got the car in a trade for his old pick-up and some food...no bill of sale or nothing.  It was right after the pulse so all the DMV records were wiped.  So we don't get anything on the seller.  Except I actually managed to find this guy, six hours on the phone... Say thank you.
You were gonna run through the law enforcement databases for a match on identifying marks.
They lifted my wallet to make it look like a robbery.  But there's a bug in my computer keyboard, a tap on the phone and a mike in the light fixture.
I'm on my way.
I just don't go in with any expectations.
You're not seriously buying into Darren's nonsense.
How long you and me known each other?
More like a mystery... Which isn't bad. It's just kinduv...mysterious...
Yeah, 'cause maybe he's learned his lesson.
Please...
Only one I can think of.
Pull the cash.
She's gonna want to hear for herself.
Or do you think we're just so grateful to have one of you idiots we'll look the other way, which is arrogant and condescending.
And Lydia telling Natalie the truth makes you a victim in what way?
Look Max, I made a terrible mistake.  One I'll never, ever make again.  Natalie and I are soulmates.  I know that now.  She's the woman I want to spend the rest of my life with.  I guess it took the thought of losing her for me to understand that.
I'll give it my best shot.
He's a little spoiled, but I know he does.
You're not gonna chicken out on me now, are you? We've got your KISS song playing and everything.
Believe it.
I don't care. I wanna hear more.
Your man is the drummer, Peter Criss, right?
Bye.
What the hell is that supposed to mean?
Whatever... stella.
Yeah.
Just for the record, I understood the last part of what you said, but for a while there you guys were making no fucking sense whatsoever.
I was just explaining to Lex here what you and I already know. Just had to make it a little more complicated so he'd understand.
Really, Jam, you tryin' to make us barf?
Check!
I've been in love with her since the second grade.
Wait a minute. We ditching the rest of school?
Cool, bro, now listen up...
You're going to be late if you don't hurry up and change soon.
But, mom!
You mean, you're sending me to... b- b-boarding school?
Just keep your lying, heathenous trap shut, Jeremiah.
Well, this is a unique confession to say the least, son. And not exactly the most interesting one I've ever heard either. You sure you don't want to talk about... oh, carnal knowledge with a neighborhood girl or impure thoughts about the new student teacher maybe... or how about finding a box of magazines under your dad's bed?
Alright, Father, here it is. About two weeks ago I went to my cousin's wedding and one of the bridesmaids asked me if I wanted to take a bath.
Tell you what. You keep guessing and I'll say something when you get it.
Huh. St. Bernard's. Figures it's named after a canine.
Damn, she musta hot wired it. We picked up a professional car thief in the shape of Olivia Newton-John!
A tag on your toe. Nobody threatens me and lives.
The KISS Army!
Neither do I!
Hello? Is this me? I'm Trip. Am I on the air?
Donnie. Donnie Darko.
I know that this is gonna sound kinda weird... but do you know anything about time travel?
A wormhole with an Einstein-Rosen bridge, which is, theoretically... a wormhole in space controlled by man.
I'm telling Mom.
I'm going home.
Why not just buy your baby a night light?
With, like, images?
Like... a Hawaiian sunset... the Grand Canyon. Things that remind you how beautiful the world can be.
What?
She wrote it.  There are chapters in this book that describe the stuff I've been seeing. It can't just be a coincidence.  Will you come see her with me?
Where is she?
There's something you have to know, Gretchen.  Everything is going to be just fine.
Where are we going?
That is a terrible nickname.
It feels wonderful.
His name is Frank.
How so?
A jet engine fell on my house... landed on my bed. While I was talking to Frank on the golf course.
Into the future.  Then he said that the world was coming to an end.
What is her name?
Yes.
I just turn the volume down and think about fucking Alyssa Milano.
No, I don't think about fucking my family. That's sick!
Four times... so far.
I don't think so. It's like a TV station. And they're tuned into mine and no one else's.
A sign from whom?
They... didn't buy me what I wanted for Christmas that year.
Regret.
That I did it again.
Because I'm so horny.
Guess who wrote it?
Why would I tell Mom?
Well, don't worry... I'm taking my medication.
You're telling me my son has an imaginary friend?
If you think Michael Dukakis will provide for this country prior to the point when you decide to squeeze one out, then I think you're misinformed.
Kitty...
Yes, I saw the news. Something about a kiddie-porn dungeon.
Please! Don't say those words.  Well... as you can see... many of us are devastated by this news. This is obviously some kind of conspiracy meant to destroy an innocent man. And I have taken it upon myself to spearhead the Jim Cunningham defence campaign. But unfortunately my civic duties have created a conflict of interest... which involves you.
Rose... I don't know if you realise how great an opportunity this is for our daughters. This has been a dream of ours for a long time.  Sometimes I doubt your commitment to Sparkle Motion.
The bottom line... Mr. Cole... is that there is material being taught to our children that is cause for this destructive behaviour.
No. It's pure bullshit, sweetie. You're lucky as hell, so you might as well enjoy it. Let's get you a root beer float.
Do you guys want some shots? I'm buyin'.
Ah! It's from State! Oh my God!
There's an indoor swimming pool! Ahhhh!
I'm sorry. They're just starin'.
No, don't say it. Another stray bullet to the head.
Mom, look, don't say anything. First of all, I'm not pregnant.
We was robbed.
Amber, I'm sorry. I really am. But you know the rules. All talent costumes hafta be okay'd by Gladys before the pageant.
Good, 'cause this isn't an American Teen Princess Pageant -- it's, it's Nazi Germany!
Oh, Amber, like you're the only one who visits Mary.
I know.
Hi.
This here's Loretta.
Oh, Christ, it's true.
What?
All right, then.
"Can I? I'm Amer-I-Can!" People ask me where I get this. I don't know, it's... maybe a gift from God or somethin'.
Guess it wasn't a garage sale as much as it was a bake sale. Ah- hahahahahahahaha!
Let go! Let go of me. Oh my God, it's COPS!
All right, let's go.
Yeah.
Well, Mom's dead, so shut your fly trap.
He should be king!
We really think he should be king and wear a crown and everything.
"My"...
Gloria, much as I hate to leave, I'd be crazy to stay here.
Yes -- why?
What's the matter with you?
All right -
He used to be a bloodhound but he's anemic --
Well, if you don't want your dog why don't you put him in a pound?
Oh no, I can't do it.
Sure.  How much does the job pay?  Sure, if there's a chance for advancement.
'At's-a no good.  I went to Niagara Falls once.
That's no good.  I like to work on the outside.  I must have something easy.
Look, I'm a very nervous man.  I gotta have a job where I come to work at eleven -- go to lunch at twelve -- and quit at one.  And twice a year I gotta have a six month vacation.
You was insulted, but you don't know it.
So! -- He's on your side, too.
Sure.
$50?
How're ya fixed for ammunition?
No... it was a seven letter word.
Well, a gal a day is enough for me. I couldn't handle any more.
All I can offer you is a Rufus over your head.
You satisfied your selfish whims, while nations tottered, dynasties rocked and the world plunged headlong into a chasm of chaos and oblivion --  Not bad, eh?
Oh.  Then there his somebody else?
That's where you come in.  I'll leave him in your hands, and don't forget you're supposed to be my niece.
Oh, yes.
I shouldn't be. We made great progress today. I taught him to repeat a few basic phrases. He did rather well, too, but I had to lead him every step of the way. Though frankly, at times I was unsure of who was leading whom.
What do you mean?
And what qualities are those? Intelligence or stupidity?
What is it?
He's doing it to spite me, I tell you, and it's got to stop!
Why is he sitting up like this? He needs rest.
I want him back!
Deformed? Is that it. Then am I to assume that he is ultimately incurable?
Well sir, perhaps I should explain...
I really don't think that's necessary Treves. I'm quite sure the committee will be able to make an equitable decision on the merits of the case, such as they are.
Then will you meet him, as a representative of the committee.
Mr. Treves, it's out of the question. I want to hear as soon as possible what the other hospitals can do. I'm sorry.
Fine, fine. You know, your dedication to this patient is an inspiring thing, Treves. But you must remember that this is a hospital, and there are many patients here. Patients who can be made well, and you owe them your first consideration. Just don't become so obsessed, old man, that you begin to neglect them.
Not me, sir. Mr. Merrick. He succeeded in spite of my shortsightedness.
No, we don't. Their committees have informed me that they're unwilling to take Mr. Merrick, even if they were supplied with funds. They don't want him.
Frankly, Treves, it's not what I'd expected. A few small cheques. Well- wishers. Don't worry, these things undoubtedly take time.
I feel much better. Thank you.
Are you comfortable here?
Mmmm. Hodges, Pierce come closer. Mr. Hill, take hold of the rope please. It's a machine accident. I expect you'll be seeing a good deal of this.
What a mess.
Oh nothing... nothing of any great importance.
Your majesty shall mock at me; I cannot speak your England.
O fair Katharine, if you will love me soundly with your French heart, I will be glad to hear you confess it brokenly with your English tongue. Do you like me, Kate?
I've brought you some things. I hope you'll like, Mr. Merrick. I hope you don't think it too forward.
Oh no, Mr. Merrick. I just work there.
Well you must go. It is one of the most beautiful places on earth. Of course, I'm rather partial.
Yes.
Won't be a moment.
Oh no, my friend...
The... oh, the spire! How silly of me, it's as plain as day... Mr. Merrick, where did you learn to do this?
Yes!
Yes.
Excellent! Now, say... "Hello"
Say "Merrick".
Mmmerrick.
Hello, my name is John Merrick.
Very good, very good. Now, when your visitor comes today I want you to say it exactly the way you said it just now. I will introduce him to you and you will say the words you've learned. If you have any trouble with any of the words, I'll help you. I'm sure you'll be just fine. If you do as well for him as you've done for me these last two days, then I'm sure our visitor will be very pleased. Now, let's go through the whole thing again, shall we? I will say "May I introduce you to Mr. Carr Gomm." And you will say...
When one is invited to tea, one must look one's best.
How is your tea, John?
We've made tremendous strides today, Mothershead. He listens and repeats with great attention, and this certainly isn't easy for him.
YOU'RE THE MONSTER! YOU'RE THE FREAK! GET OUT! YOU'RE FINISHED!
Handsomely?... Who sent you?
Pardon me?
It's your fantasy...
No, of course not, silly -- I mean FELT like this about them?
It was different...
Oh, for goodness' sake!
And I thought you said it was something special...
You're as bad as my father.
Who?
I MUST look! Keitel! Hold this!
The second note to wake the Gods...
But, Aud... I... I came to find someone...
Halfdan wanted to stop you waking the Gods... so... I disguised myself to sabotage their plans.
That I cannot tell you.
Oh, no no no! It's just the Horn Resounding is...
The Gods are asleep, King Arnulf.
I don't suppose you... you DO like me at all?
You DON'T like it, do you?
Well it just seems a little bit crude, that's all.
Oh, that's all right then... it's the thought... that counts...
I dunno... you looked so... so vulnerable...
Why... should YOU care?
I'll ask the Gods to give you life again!
But...
He wants to KILL us.
Where does it all get us, Grandpa?
Sorry.
Look... Erik...
Now stop it!
Trust me to get the missionary.
Now you've got all the ones with beards on one side and all the moustaches on the other.
I've got you!
No! Arrgh!
Oh... er... yes...
Just say something cheerful.
How about making friends?
What is it?
What are you talking about?
It doesn't matter WHERE you sit!
Got you!
I... I...
Get away, Snorri.
What have you got there?
Oh, I couldn't do that! The Blacksmith's Code says...
Help!
I know, Dad.
I KNOW! I'VE HEARD IT ALL 1 THOUSAND TIMES!
It's no good going berserk against a dragon!
Easy, Dad!
I'm not frightened... of anything...
Yes, Mother.
And don't forget: never let your enemy get behind you.
They can't erase memories. It's a joke. It's a nasty Clementine hoax.
I hope you feel better, sweetie.
Just a little overworked, maybe.
I was not.
You rat.
Nothing makes any sense. Nothing makes any sense.
Um, okay. I'll call my study partner.
I don't have one.
Yeah. Tom Waits says it in --
I'm not nuts.
Yeah. I'm not, like, a Robert Frost lover by any stretch. His stuff seems strictly grade school to me. But this made me cry for some reason. Maybe because it is grade school. Y'know?
I don't know! I can't see them from here, Joel! Just pick something good.
Yeah, I guess.
It's helpful to think there's some order to things. You're kind of closed mouthed, aren't you?
Oh.  Does that make you sad? Or anxious? I'm always anxious thinking I'm not living my life to the fullest, y'know? Taking advantage of every possibility? Just making sure that I'm not wasting one second of the little time I have.
What's the goal, Joel?  My goal, Joel, is to just let it flow through me? Do you know what I mean? It's like, there's all these emotions and ideas and they come quick and they change and they leave and they come back in a different form and I think we're all taught we should be consistent. Y'know? You love someone -- that's it. Forever. You choose to do something with your life -- that's it, that's what you do. It's a sign of maturity to stick with that and see things through. And my feeling is that's how you die, because you stop listening to what is true, and what is true is constantly changing. You know?
I don't believe in that soulmate crap anymore, but... he says so many great things. We like the same writers. This writer Stephen Dixon he turned me on to. And he's cute. It's fucked up. Joel, you should come up to the Charles with me sometime.
No, see, Clem, I assume you fucked someone tonight. Isn't that how you get people to like you?
Let's talk about it later.
No. I want to have a baby. I have to have a baby.
You're a whiz kid. So perceptive, so --
No. Thanks.
Well... if they're looking for me in memories I'm in, what if you take me to a memory I'm not in?  And we can hide there till morning.
Yes, but I can't love a man named Wally.
This is our first "date" date.
Naomi, I guess.
But you weren't. I could tell.
I was so nervous. I remember I couldn't think of anything to say. There were long silences.
Yeah?
Not yet. Not married.
So make your domestic decisions and maybe we'll talk again.
It would be different, if we could just give it another go around.
You said --
I know what you mean. That's why I stopped.
Yeah, yeah. It goes "Perhaps there is someone in this world to whom I could send all these lines"?
Tonight. Just to test out the phone lines.
Joel, come here. Please.
Because I just am not drunk enough or stoned enough to make that happen right now.
Hey, Joel --
Well, sounds like me. Sorry, man.  Says you were jealous and suspicious.
Doesn't sound like me.
I probably got the same thing as you.
Jesus.
Maybe I'm making a mistake. Maybe I just need to learn to live with this. First of all, I'll get over it. Secondly, it happened. Those who do not remember history are condemned to repeat it. Who said that? Churchill? I'm not sure. But I don't care. She did it to me. I have to rid myself of this. Fuck her.
It's not somebody else.
Hi, Rob and Carrie.
I don't know. I'm not sure there's a big public demand for books on Calvinism and Misogyny.
I know. Anyway --
Anyway, I've got to do my tap dance here.
I better do this, Stan.
Well, allow me to do the honors. It's fucking freezing and I need something.
Don't you think Howard's like that? Smart? Important?
Yup.
Where?
Sor-ry  We have to do something. He can't wake up half done.
You were in red. That red sweater with the little flowers, I think. You were leaning against his car.  He looked a little like a kid. Kind of goofy and wide-eyed. I'd never seen him look like that before. Happy. You looked beautiful. You looked in love.
I know what it is.
They have a right to know. Howard is a thief. He steals the truth.  I can't remember my baby! I can't remember my baby. It existed and I can't even remember. Do you understand that?
Yes?
Order me a pastrami for after?
Yes, shit. Oops, sorry!  Sorry. It's just I told myself I wasn't going to say Pope Alexander and sound like a dope and then I go ahead and do it. Like I psyched myself out.
I have a family, Mary.
Yeah, probably a good idea.
Mary has stolen our files and is sending them back to people.
Just wanted to let you know.
I like Mary. I like when she comes to visit. I just don't think she likes me.
Patrick, we need to focus.
Maybe if you stopped stealing their panties.
Ha ha ho ho and hee hee.
That's your problem.
Cowgirls exist as an image. A fairly common image. The idea of cowgirls especially for little girls prevails in our culture. Therefore, it seems to me, the existence of cowgirls should prevail. Otherwise, they're being fooled. In the Rodeo Hall of Fame in Oklahoma City there are just two cowgirls. Two. And both of 'em are trick-riders. Trick-riding is what cowgirls have almost always done in rodeos. Our society sure likes to see its unconventional women do tricks. That's what prostitutes call it, you know: 'tricking.'
FROM MEN, THE WHOOPING CRANE HAS RECEIVED NEITHER LOVE NOR RESPECT. MEN HAVE DRAINED THE CRANE'S MARSHES, STOLEN ITS EGGS, INVADED ITS PRIVACY, POLLUTED ITS FOOD, FOULED ITS AIR, BLOWN IT APART WITH BUCKSHOT.
I think she's disappointed that I'm not more, ah, sort of atavistic. She's got some naive, sentimental notions about Indians. I'm sure she liked me, though; but.... then she left town.
Well.... er...
I have to go, Julian.
So now you're bummin' around?
Oh my dear yes, I bought a little ranch out West, sort of a tribute to the women of America who have cooperated with me in eliminating their odor by using my vaginal products, Dew spray mist and Yoni Yum spray powder. A tax write-off, actually.
Well, okay. I'll try it. I don't see the point in it, but I'll try it. Just for you. It's kind of silly, actually, me going out with an artist in New York City. However...
Justin?
You've had plenty EVA, Coop, it's Justin's turn. Stay on station. If anything happens...
On my way.
I'd rather spend the next twelve hours Outside than another five minutes in this can. This ship is bad. It watches you.
Smith, clear that airlock, man, I'm coming in.
Skipper, do we get hazard pay for this?
You weren't there. I saw it.
Can you shut it down?
What happened?
Oh God...
One thing at a time, let's keep him breathing. Start the drip, 15cc's fibrinogen, Christ, he's bleeding out...
What's on your mind?
It won't stop, it goes on and on and on...
Starck!
Dr. Weir, Admiral Hollis would like to see you as soon as possible.
This is not about my reputation! This is not about me at all!  The Event Horizon was created for one reason: to go faster than light. Imagine mankind exploring new solar systems, colonizing new worlds. Seven years ago, we didn't just lose the ship and the crew. We lost the dream.  I have to go.
I don't know, this place is really dark, I can't see a thing...
The science workstation has power, I'll see if I can find the crew from here.
...how's the client?
Do it.
In an emergency, the charges detonate in series, destroying the central section and separating the personnel areas from the rest of the ship. That way, if the gravity drive malfunctions, the crew could use the foredecks as a lifeboat.
Captain Miller, the foredecks are just ahead.
Dr. Weir's right. Get on board the Event Horizon. I'll meet you at the airlock.
That's bullshit and you know it! You built this fucking ship and all I've heard from you is bullshit!
You can't, your orders are specific...
We will take the Lewis and Clark to a safe distance and then launch tac missiles at the Event Horizon until I am satisfied that she has been destroyed.  Fuck this ship.
Son of a bitch!
One-four degrees...
Yes, sir.
We don't have time to fart.
Smith? Smith! Fuck!
Then what are you doing here? Come on, people, let's go!  And Cooper... Put some pants on.
I thought of that, with the filters from the Clark, we've got enough breathable air for twenty hours. After that, we'd better be on our way home.
I can reconfigure the scan for C-12, amylase proteins.
What is it, Starck?
Five seconds.
He's dead...
They attempted to rescue a supply shuttle bound for Titan. The shuttle's oh-two tanks ruptured during the rescue, flooded both ships with pure oxygen. There was a spark and both ships were incinerated. The Skipper and three others just made it to a lifeboat. Captain Miller was able...
Blood. Looks like arterial spray.
It's cold.
That's the Core: the gravity drive. The heart of the ship.
We're losing atmosphere...
Range 3000 meters and closing.
I'm trying, goddammit --
How?
If they were in stasis, I'd get a location, but these readings, they're all over the ship. It doesn't make any sense.
Hmmm. Claire used to tell me I loved the Event Horizon more than I loved her. I told her that wasn't true, I just knew the Event Horizon better, that's all.
Yes. I miss her. She died. Two years now.
It wants me. I have to go.
My step-dad's. I'm strictly into stone. I was wondering when you'd walk by.
I wouldn't know anything about that.
Wouldn't want to keep Vic waiting.
What did he do to the uniform?!
It's easy for you to be patient.
To help you. I've run every test known to man. And they all yield the same result: the machine is ready.
Ben, think about all the people we can help if this works --
Youthful high spirits.
I'm sure he's matured since then.
Reed. Even you can't compute every little thing.
Yeah, you and Debbie and perfect --
Ben, I'm afraid I've got to ask --
Not unless you want that clipboard stretched up your --
Oh, you remember my name do you? You happen to remember what you swore to do with every breath in your body?
Reed?... Sue?
Ben! Ben!
I can go hotter!
What are you trying to say? Just because I dress well and like to dance --
I think that thing is Ben.
Dude. That's my sister.
Look around, sis! She's not here. So you can stop talking to me like I'm your little boy --
Sis. Let me take care of you for once.
Reed's always right. Good thing he doesn't always know what he's got...
Showtime.
History, Leonard. History. Everything else is conversation...  How's the other matter?
Actually, uh, people seem to think the scar "humanizes" you.
Front page?
Right. That's exactly what I meant.
Which was?
No, I distinctly remember: you walked out my door. Ergo...
And reverse the mutations --
No way to know. Without more tests, experiments.
Every variable but yourself. You don't eat, sleep. You can't live in your head like --
Reed. Shh. Just be quiet. And look up.
Hilarious.
Uh, Victor, I hope I haven't done something to make you think...
I told you, I'm fine. It's you I'm worried about.
Then why is Reed dragging his feet? Maybe he likes having his prize specimen under glass...  It's ironic, isn't it? You're finally the perfect woman for him... because you're his science project.
You want to work at Carl's?
Look. Just put your little hand back in the cash register and give me my $2.75 back. Okay?  Please, Brad?
I'm sorry, sir. Just let me find the forms here.
They're not home yet.
I didn't say that.
Thanks a lot, Brad. I really appreciate it.
Okay, Dennis.
How about both of us at the same time?
What? Are you all right?
I think I came. Didn't you feel it?
I guess I did.
Look, I'm kind of in a hurry.
Yeah. My brother Art got his girlfriend one once.
Seventy-five dollars, and a ride. Okay.
She's in my biology class.
Did you get her number?
It's never too soon! Girls decide how far to let you go in the first five minutes.
I was going to say... your eyes look a little red.
I've been swimming, Merv.
Suzanne Somers' tits.
All right. Die, Granada Jocks!
You can't fix this car, Spicoli.
Yeah, but I fucked up. You can take it. Really.
What should I do?
If I didn't have a fianc in Chicago, I'd go for it.
No way! He just called him a dick.
It was okay.
You really ought to look at this, Linda. There's a drawing on every page... and all these quizzes. It's like school.
Climax together.
I know. He hates to have to wear uniforms.
God, I don't think so. Better look in the house.
Then I called his house, and his mother told me he was in the garage helping his father.
Romance in Ridgemont? We don't even get cable TV.
Not coming? What happened?
I didn't tell anyone I applied cause I never thought I'd make it.
Hey -- Doug Stallworth? It's his loss.
Hey, bud. What's your problem?
I'm afraid we've got some things to discuss here, Jeff.
If you graduate.
I don't know. Wherever you want.
Yes.
Excellent.
Me, too. I'm real sorry someone broke in and stole your tape deck.
I don't know. Probably out. Want something to drink?
Well, I'm going to change real quick. I hope you don't mind.
Thanks. So...  What do you want to do?
Well... it's getting kind of late.
It's John Bonham's birthday.
What about the notes?
I'm fine. Mark, I'm so glad you came over here because I want you to know something. I just thought I would tell you that I really enjoyed getting to know you this year.
I know everybody says it, but I really mean it.
Well... sure.  She will have the Seafood Salad Special. And I will have... the same.
Listen, you fuzzy little shithead -- I've been fucked around, in my time, by a fairly good cross-section of mean-tempered rule-crazy cops and now it's MY turn. "Fuck you, officer, I'm in charge here, and I'm telling you we don't have room for you."
Ah, yes. Mr. Duke? You have one message: "Call Lucy at the Americana Hotel, room 1600."
WHAT?  What was that crazy bitch said to him?  There's a war on, man! People are being killed!
Witchcraft? Shit, you can't mean it!
What do you mean by that?
Wait a minute! Come back and have a beer!
Pay no attention to this swine. He can't handle the medicine. 
You better be careful. Plenty of vultures out here. They'll pick your bones clean before morning.
How about "Nickel Nick's Slot Arcade?" "Hot Slots," that sounds heavy. Twenty- nine cent hotdogs...
Look, what are we doing here? Are we here to entertain ourselves, or to do the job?
That's what gives me The Fear.
No. This is serious. One more hour in this town and I'll kill somebody!
Don't go near that elevator. That's just what they want us to do... trap us in a steel box and take us down to the basement.
I dig my own graves. Green water and the White Rabbit. Put it on.
Don't touch it! Get back in that tub!
Shit. I met her on the plane and I had all that acid.  You know, those little blue barrels. I gave her a cap before I realized... she's a religious freak... Jesus, she's never even had a drink.
NO! Stop talking like that.
You'll go straight to the gas chamber. And even if you manage to beat that, they'll send you back to Nevada for Rape and Consentual Sodomy. She's got to go.
What?... What kind of goddamn monster are you?
I felt like a Nazi, but it had to be done.
Right. Let's find a good seafood restaurant and eat some red salmon. I feel a powerful lust for red salmon...
They just ran back out into Death Valley -- you know, where Manson turned up...
Hurry up with those drinks. We're thirsty. Only two rums. Make mine a Bloody Mary.
Some of what?
Yeh... This foreign made crap -- is sucking our dollar balance dry!
How much is the lemon meringue pie?
Ridiculous! Just say you were hitchhiking to the airport and I picked you up. You never saw me before. Shit, this town is full of white Cadillac convertibles. I plan to go through there so fast that nobody will even glimpse the goddamn license plate. You ready?
YOU'RE UNDER ARREST!
Why not? It was getting warm anyway.
That's a strange attitude.
One phone call every day. Just tell us what you've seen. Don't worry if it doesn't add up, that's our problem.
Spare me.
I figure it's karma. You wronged me and you wronged your wife and you wronged your children, so this is karma biting you on the ass, or in your case...  ...on the eye.
What the fuck are you doing he's in there!
Um, yeah, thirty miles east.
I don't wanna go home alone... I don't wanna see what might have...
Gonna stay for a couple?
C'mon guys--
Where's that?
What's it for?
Look, yeah, he's an ass, but he's my brother. Que sera-sera.
Gimme a couple dabs on the tongue.
Magic potion.  You should try a little.
You're wasting your time, there's no one out there.
How many?
Keys.
Hey, when this plan completely goes to shit, what are ya gonna do?
Clear!
Amazing you made it this far.
Right. Were going to need some fire power.  Do you have any sort of guns or ammunition here? Anything at all?
All right.
Right.
I just hit it like you said.
Look, Frances, I didn't want this job. Think I'm crazy? But you begged me: improve your image. So please... lemme try, huh?
But I'm the one up there on the screen.
Come here. I want to show you something.
GET OUT!
Showdown.
Dwayne! I'm Dwayne now! And you damn well better get used to it!
Dick...
You... I'm sorry, forgive me. Doctor, tell me honestly, what do I have to do to get out of here?
Really?
...No, Ralph. I don't believe I ever was sick. But when you're treated like a patient long enough, you're apt to act like one...
See you next weekend, Dad.
Yeah... well... it's possible. Harry York and I both work for Mr. Kaminski right now, and... well... There are lots of folks in this country who never got a square break. That's the way of things, but Mr. Kaminski wants to change it, and when it comes to new ideas, the people in power get nervous.
No, no, no. All he wants to do is see the common man get a little representation.
...Then go.
Thank you.
You've sacrificed?! If you'd practice law for decent folk instead of Communists and indigents --
They need help, Lil. They pay me back in other ways.
How? What do they do for you, Kaminski and his friends? They're all anarchists! Traitors!
As usual. Everything as usual, Mr. Farmer. Just give me my due.
Oh Angela, my own... Angela!
I don't believe this! You jerks drag me down here in the middle of the night and you don't even know who the hell I am!
Boy, I'd love to... but I'm going to Hollywood.
Why... yes.
No, I don't hate it.
Now wait a minute, sweetie. Do I look like a newshound to you?
No... Actually, you look more like a cop.
Yeah, well --
Now you're catchin' on. Don't wanna get your Daddy in hot water, do you?
But I'm not. The newspapers're --
Harry.
Yeah, it's a gift. You gotta do something with it.
Quietly.
What happened to him?
You don't know what you want.
Is that why you did it?
The hell you will, Harry York.
He deserves a show. He missed the movie.
I don't know. It hurts, Harry. Some things, no matter what you do with them, they just hurt.
You're coming.
What a man!
Huh?
Oh Harry...
No, Harry, it's not time, it's us. You and me. And I'm telling you now that I'll come to you, okay? I'll find you. I will.
Oh. Why, Harry York. How nice to see you.
Yeah. Yeah, I heard about that.
I never saw him. Why didn't he show up?
That's fine with me...  Get it? Fine. A fine! Hey c'mon, c'mon, what is this, an audience or a jury?
I live here.
Your big speech?
I already have.
You think I got it?
Yes, Ma.
What?
Nothing. I think I'll just go out for awhile.
I'll be back.
Wait, Mama, wait. I have something to tell you. I've decided... well... I'm not going to make movies anymore. I thought that's what I wanted, and I went after it with all my soul, the way you taught me, but I was miserable, Mama, and it nearly killed me. So now... now it's over. I want a different kind of life, something... simple. I want to live someplace quiet and peaceful... in the country maybe, and I'll have dogs and cats -- I feel so light suddenly, so clear for the first time in... It's going to be okay, Mama, I know it. And I love you.
You're not going anywhere!
Yes, I am, and you can't stop me! You can't tell me what to do, mother. I'm a grown woman, and I can decide about my own life.
Frances!
No, Mama, I'll take care of it. I'll wash them in the morning.
You were hoping for a kind word?! You're my mother! You're supposed to nourish me! Support me!
I have!
Normal. Average.
...Did you really say that?
This whole thing is a joke!
Frances, you're still filled with anxiety. You feel guilty and hostile toward your family and friends. Consequently, I didn't recommend your release at the staff review.
Mental illness is an elusive thing, and though I'm pleased you're feeling more... capable, it's perhaps unrealistic to expect you to be completely cured after so short a time. Don't you agree?
Dr. Symington, how big is your dick?
I checked the files. This one holds the record for shock treatments. Four hundred seventeen and no end in sight.
I was watching.
I am afraid.
You speak.
More to the point, why am I here? What did you want with me?  What does one say to one's Maker, having finally met him face to face? Milton gave it voice.  Did I request thee, Maker, from my clay to mould me Man? Did I solicit thee from Darkness to promote me?
Trace memories in the brain, perhaps.
A companion. A female. Like me, so she won't hate me.
Yes. I want this over and done with.
I'll be waiting. And watching.
She's not for you.
One-two-three, one-two-three, twirl- two-three...
So have I
And not a word of them to Father. He's agitated enough not hearing from Victor.
Give me that child before you fill his head with drivel!
You will.  What do you want, Victor?
All my life I've known.
Is that what makes it so delicious?
I will be here when you return.
Not as weak as I.
...until our wedding night. When our bodies will join.
I know only that he is a killer. And I shall bring back his carcass.
We need each other now, I need your comfort and strength, not separation and solitude.
A month at most, that's all I ask.  Elizabeth, please. Things have not yet resolved. I must take steps to see that they do. For our family's sake. For our sake.  You are life itself. We shall seal our vow. The moment I am done.
I have been waiting for this ever since.
Open this door for no-one!
Aye, Captain.
Do you foresee this happening in our lifetimes?
They'll hang him all the same.
It was wrong, Henry! It shouldn't have happened! The bastard deserves to die.
You can't. Death is God's will!
No. He had more important work.
That is my concern.  I'm involved in something just now. I want to finish it in Waldman's memory.
You'll be leaving then.  Just as well. You never were cut out for this, Henry. Goodbye.
A... week?
Victor. This place looked like a charnel house. What went on here?
So you have claimed. Yet you have no explanation for this.  The locket last seen in the hands of the poor murdered child was found hidden in your dress the morning following the murder. The locket you so coveted.  How did it come to be in your possession?
What is your name?
Why? God alone knows what it means. Until it has proven value, it's nothing more than a ghoulish parlor trick. Hardly fit for the classroom.
It is a thrilling direction to explore. Thrilling and dangerous.  Nature can be wonderful and terrible. Science is not a realm for the reckless; it needs a conscience. We must proceed cautiously. Assess as we go.  What I do on my own time is my own business. The same holds true for you. You wish to expand your mind? Fine, do so. You can even join me here, if you like. But not at the expense of your normal studies.
Ah. An explorer.
I guess...
Push on this side. Alice, this is Jack, Marcie and Ned. Push.
I don't know. Probably be best for everybody.
Thanks, Alice.
Almost five.
I'll go take a look.
Marcie?
I meant everything.
Oh, you...
Whatever you make yourself.
Wait, wait! When I was finding these goodies in the shed. I also found this letter which a camper never sent home. Listen.
Makes me want to hold on and never let go.
Ned!
Lead the way!
Girls can't be cowboys.
Those things can be nasty.
They'll be okay if they know enough to stay in outta the rain.
For two lonely nights.
No, but I passed by it a couple of times. It's out in the middle of nowhere. It seems like a rowdy place, so there wouldn't be a lot of police. And it's open from dusk till dawn. You said meet you in the morning.
Did they look like psychos? They were fuckin' vampires. Psychos don't explode when sunlight hits 'em, I don't care how crazy they are.
You can't, but fifteen percent instead of thirty for my stay at El Ray is a good start.
I'm exhausted.
Jacob.
Okay, Jacob, get up and sit your ass down on the bed. Make a wrong move and I'll shoot you in the face.
On the dresser.
If you're taking people, take me. But my kids aren't going anywhere with you.
My children are not going with you, and that's that.
Yes.
I think I've gotten about as up close and personal with you as I'm gonna get. Now if you need me like I think you need me, you're not gonna kill me 'cause I won't answer your stupid, prying questions. So, with all due respect, mind your own business.
You best better get it done, Pops.
Well, you just keep thinkin' of that gun next to Kate's temple.
Then stop, 'cause that's where we're going.
He's smilin' at us. But behind his smile, he's sayin', "Fuck you Jack." I hear that loud and clear.
I'm gonna just sit here and drain this bottle. And when I've drunk the last drop, if I still feel then, the way I feel now, I'm gonna take this bottle and break it over his melon head.
It's just, all our lives you've been a pastor. For twenty years you've preached trust in the lord. And then one day you wake up and say fuck him?
Where are you taking us?
In the room. Were you serious, or were you just foolin' around? I'm just bringing it up, 'cause if you really want me to do that for you, I will.
Okay.
Noooo!
Well, when you run out of weapons, just start cold cocking 'em. Make 'em sing for their supper.
You use 'em on the first couple of these parasites that try to bite you.
Later.
-- you got your shower --
Not even for lunch?
Well that don't matter now, 'cause you got about two fuckin' seconds to live! Richie!
What dya mean?
One... Two... Three.
He didn't recognize shit.
No.
They don't have anything except four walls and a roof, and that's all we need.
-- This conversation is over.
What?
Duly noted. Now, shut up.
What does that mean?
When we get to El Ray, I'll take care of it.
That's what you look like.
It don't look together.
No problem, lieutenant.
Okay, but... You didn't have to do what you did.  Not for me.
Standing right here in my office.
So.  We're still coming to terms with the exact protocol for this -- for integrating the Spec-Recon training.  It may not always be smooth, but we're trying to make it as painless as possible for you.
Don't worry about it.  If it's off your collar and out of your eyes, that's all I'm going to ask.
No, sir, WHAT?
And if you just happen to wash out, I won't have to contend with you bitchin' to some hairy-chested female Senator?  And please note I did not identify any one in particular.
West?
O'Neil.  Our air's gonna crap out as soon as we get down there.  You know that, don't you?
I'll act surprised.
This is just a test case, O'Neil. But if it works out -- if you work out -- it could well change the Navy's official policy on women in combat.  Or, actually, its official non-policy.  Now who's your immediate superior there?
Hmmm.  Maybe I'll ask when I see you in person.
What changed?
I wanted the choice.  The chance to prove myself, my skills, my work, me.  That's how it should've been.
... two... one... MARK!
Sir?
Every class has its surprises, Pyro. This one'll be no different.
Get it up!
You'll try what we tell you to try, O'Neil.  Go regulation.
I believe he earned it for saving a man's life in Saudi Arabia.  He wanted you to have it.  He was very clear on that point.
Probably hear back from CNN first.
Is this my glory, sir?
Royce.  We're the same age, we started the same time -- and now you're sitting in the upperdecks while I'm still down in the bullpen. What does that tell you about the Navy?
Well, guess I don't even need to be here...
Wick.  They got your crew, too?
That's a good story.
Maybe I'll just head over to McP's with the others, have a drink or four.  Don't wanna come, do you?
I can't go out.  Not like this.
Grab an oar, find a way to weight it down, we're gonna need it.  Cortez, help him.  Flea?  You take one of the two full minis -- and just follow my lead.
Green Eggs and Ham.  You're not going to get anywhere.  You might as well put me in the cage.
No.  Yes.  I mean, depends on --
I think you're the liar.
That your desk?  I'll take this one.
So am I.
Christ, I don't want to see her take a fall.  She thinks I do, but...
Even tough I don't talk to her every day -- I still talk to her every day.  Know what I mean?
No! I just couldn't see myself with some boring egg head who spends his summer picking apart cockroaches. I wanted to have some adventure, some fun...
Sure I was. I thought Lucy was gonna kill me.
No.
No, I'm into earthworms now. You wouldn't be interested. They're real "boring" creatures. Very reliable, dependable, no surprises...
You're still mad at me, aren't you?
What else do you know about it?
I don't get it. If it's the first of its kind, how can it be pregnant?
He was my college sweetie! Look at him. He looks so handsome on t.v. What the hell is he doing in Panama.
Remember my friend we saw on t.v.?
Are you serious? He's going to consider me for he job? What else did he say?
Mr. Caiman...
Not anymore. Mr. Caiman, I quit.
You mean to tell me that there is no one who holds a special place in your heart?
Allez, allez!
Major, what do you think could have done this?
Don't tell me why it's not, tell me what the hell it is.
Um, excuse me, sir, but the situation's more complicated than that. The blood I recovered revealed that the creature is either about to lay eggs or already has.
Are you sure? How do you know?
I am not permitted to speak of such things.
I'm sorry, sir, I was only-
Yes sir... The use of your waste facilities were strangely absent from the historical records, so we had to extrapolate purely on the basis of your anatomy.
Thanks.
Friend. You stole all my best lines.  You cut me out of episode two entirely!..
I won't and nothing you say-
I heard something. A squeal.
Okay... Let's go, buddy, they can take It from here... I'mo-
No. I can't go out there! I won't say that ridiculous catch phrase one more time. I won't.  I can't!
They're drifting toward me... I think they're magnetic!...
You think you could do better "Laredo?"
The ships are gaining...
I have sectors 1-28.  I think Hector has the upper levels.
... But I want you to know that I am not a complete braincase, okay? I understand completely that It's just a TV show. There is no ship, there is no Beryllium Sphere, no diagital conveyor... I mean, obviously it's all just a-
Brandon.. . The crew and I are in trouble and we need your help.
Okay, you can go on in... I'm going to get Kyle. He knows the utility tunnel system better than anybody alive.
We'd never have the budget for this.
Okay, so do you see a door marked "CORE UNIT?" Should be down at the far end to your left.
It's fractured...
... What does that mean?
I...Well, uh... Yes, absolutely.
Right.
I don't like this... I don't like this at all...
Hey. Thanks for one nice intro... uh.
I think he just likes pointing at things.
C'mon, we're wanted up on the command deck.
Wait... Jason, Here!...
We shouldn't have to DO this!  It makes NO LOGICAL SENSE! Why is it HERE?
Well forget it!  I'm not going.  This episode was badly written!
You... You mean Earth?
Then how did he find out about the device?
You what?.. What are you talking about?
We have become aware of these concepts only recently. In our dealings with Sarris. Often Sarris will say one thing, and do another. Promise us mercy and deliver destruction... It is a concept we are beginning to learn at some great cost.  But if you are saying that any of you could have traits in common with Sarris.
A model, only as big as this.
I didn't say that.  I said "wouldn't it be great if we could always, work together." That's what I said.
Okay, let's go.
We've got to get out of here.  C'mon, hurry
Commander?... Call me Laredo?
Get oacK on their tail.
Fire at will. hI~D  NT. PROTECTOR
You'd have to travel hundreds of miles through the wilderness.
They died well.  Otherwise, they didn't do much right.  But if we have war, the British will surely send their best troops:  right now they have no other enemies.
Oh, they have reasons... there's a lot of confusion these days.
Don't do anything rash, please, Benedict.
The army can survive without me.
Someday, George, you may need to act for the good of the people no matter what Congress thinks that is.  It may come down to us, or them someday.  You or them.  Cicero was right:  was is 'a time when the laws are silent'.
There's this whispering campaign against me ever since Gates won at Saratoga.
Tell Mrs. Washington I am compelled to stay a while longer.
None of the servants is to touch a gun!  You know that!
Yes, William.  I am apologizing.
By red, what rank would you say this black, officer, soldier is, Colonel?
The British!  These men cannot stand against them!
Marquis!  Get these men reformed, send Steuben and Wayne out on the left...
To learn to shoot cannon?
We better, Congress invented him.
Did you know that Arnold left the entire defenses of this fort in complete disrepair?  Most of our cannons are so neglected they may as well have been spiked!?  You realize what would happen if this fort fell?  The whole Hudson would be open to them!
Is this a coup?  Alexander, are you trying to tell me that I might be assassinated if I don't agree?
But it's more than just that, am I right?
Of course the army will acquit him, that's not the point... Arnold is a man and will understand.  What I need to understand is, John, Sam... what is happening here?  Who are those people in there?  The fat ones in silk?
They are... friends of Congress.
He's from Virginia -- there is no more classist, elitist... English place on earth than Virginia.  And, what in hell has he done for our cause?  Washington has been preaching compromise, compromise, compromise!  Hancock acts, he led the Boston Tea party!  That's why New England loves him.
Makes you gag.
These men have suffered but I believe they will fight.
The British Army is right back there, across that river!  Sir!  I think it must be something else that detains General Lee.
What's the difference?
I understand, George.
Well, George, Congress just passed a resolution censuring Arnold for destruction of government property. I wouldn't cast my fate with that man.
They are also very religious.  So, we will attack them three days from now, on Christmas.  One force under me, and another to the south under Colonel Cadwalader...
How many generals do we have like Arnold?  He's got guts -- he's vain, and he fights!
Are you all going insane!? Benedict Arnold!  The man who stopped the British on Lake Champlain!  Who carried the day at Saratoga!  Goddamn-it, Joseph, you own two mansions, ride in an expensive, Tory coach!  You are all nothing but a pack of greedy pigs!
What I want to know is sir:  where is your daddy?
The one with 'Philadelphia' spelled correctly is the counterfeit.
These supplies...?
General Lee, sir!
Of course, if it were that simple.  These people?  They're after something else...
I'm very aware of that.
It's an anti-Christian dogma!  I cannot believe you are so calm about it!
Leave me, now sir, I am tired.
We're leaving them?
Then, maybe I do see what you're after -- perhaps... you get to chose again...
Yes sir, it's a wise idea...
But not more than your comfort.
And what is this, then?  Been off to fight the French because you are a patriot?  Or is this you, gaining your long sought after rise in society by becoming victorious in war!?
George, I'm sorry.
Africa?  That's so far?  How do they get here?
Capture them?  Well, I've never seen anything like it, so... of course I'm curious.
In the minuet, George, every movement is significant, like the strut of cranes...
It's the freest land on earth.
You're out of your mind!
Yes!
An Oldsmobile Silhouette.
I guess still in the locker.
Plan B. Here ya go, honey...
The money. Fuck. I gotta think...
Hey, he should have a weapon, a knife or something.
You serious? This is how you guys do business? I can't believe you aren't dead.
I don't need a gun. Where is it? If it isn't on you, it's around here someplace.
Sure. Family. I know how that goes.
Now why would you do that? Put the money in a locker?
He's around someplace.
I went to UC San Diego.  We're gonna spend the weekend at the Universal Sheraton. We're gonna take the tour. See the shark. Check out the Miami Vice Action Spectacular. After, we'll come here, get our money.
Yeah, Morgan Freeman. But he's a colored guy.
Man, I can't wait for you to be dead.
Boy, this town. Word gets around, doesn't it?
Chili Palmer showed you my script?
It's not the kind of thing you do.
I'm already in town, but it don't matter. We got dick in the bank. We dumped it all in Harry's movie.
Who is this? I'm the one telling you the way it is, okay, asshole? That's who I am. Now you want your three hundred grand or don't you?
The three hundred grand a guy named Leo Devoe scammed off an airline. The three hundred grand Chili Palmer now has in his possession.
Yeah, I'm here. I just don't like the anonymous crap. It means your either chickenshit or not for real.
Who?
Harry Zimm. The man happens to be a major Hollywood player.
'Cause the guy's a customer now, stupid. His ass belongs to me.
Yeah? Which terminal?
He owes me money.
Not yet. I just started.
I want you to keep looking right here, okay?
Dick Allen's a very dear friend of mine. How far you want to go with this?
They don't want to deposit yours and have it bounce. That annoys them. So your dear friend Dick Allen's been calling, leaving messages on your machine, but you never get back to him. I happen to be in Vegas on another matter, and Dick asks me as a favor would I look you up. I follow you over here, see you in the window with this woman, looks a lot like that actress Karen Flores, was in Grotesque, except she's not blond anymore...
Come on, Harry - Mesas? The worst they might do is get a judgment against you, uttering a bad check. I can't imagine you want that to happen, man in your position.
Wait a minute, you're not the guy, are you? The dry cleaner?
You wouldn't be talking to me if you were.
But you work for the casino?
So you don't work for the casino?
"Mr. Lovejoy".
No, his best part was the cripple gay guy that climbed Mt. Whitney.
What do you get out of this?
Read it. It's a grabber.
Cash. It happens to be waiting right at this moment in a locker at the airport.
'E.g.' means 'for example', Ray. I think what you wanna say is 'i.e.'
Ask your man here.
Martin. It was a beautiful role. All I had to do was find the character's center, the stem I'd used to wind him up and he'd play, man, he'd play.
If you'd like to tell me, yeah.
Like this?
Here's another tip...
A hundred and fifty-six. Some'll charge you more'n that, go as high as six for five on a short-term loan. So three a week's not too bad.
Yeah. It's a real gift.  I'm just saying it'd be nice, one time in my career to get the chance to say one great line. You know, like in that Bette Davis picture, "Cabin in the..."
Then you've read it?
Yeah well... I like movies. I figure if I help Harry make one, I'll find out what you have to do outside of have an idea and raise the money. That doesn't sound too hard. I was in the money business and I get ideas all the time.
You were supposed to wait for me with Harry at the restaurant.
Yeah. There's a girl in it now.
Hey, Chili? Look at me.
You're as bad as Harry...
Guy's got a fucking pink toilet, for Christ's sake.
Yeah, the guy owes Momo a few G's.
Tomorrow, I see on the TV weather, it's gonna be nice and warm. You won't need the coat.
Don't worry about it. I won't say any more than I have to, if that.
I'm going into the movie business.
What're you talking about? You wanna be a movie star?
Hey, Chil? I think you're fulla shit.
Hm?
What he was, was a hack, couldn't get a job writing for anybody but you.  I'm being honest. He was a lousy writer, but he was a good husband. I just didn't know it until too late.
Be quiet and listen.
He happens to be loaning me five hundred grand, no strings, I write any kind of agreement I want.
Really.
Passenger vessel "Chimera." I will spell: charlie hotel india mary echo romeo alpha. No registry information is available at this time. I have determined to the best of my ability that the vessel has been abandoned on the high seas at position one seven four west, five seven north at...  Two zero one four hours zulu time. Over.
Roger, North Island. Please advise pending further information. Over.
Roger that, North Island. Arctic Warrior whiskey alpha sierra bravo four zero niner two. Over and out.
I'll sleep good tonight knowing that.
Take it easy, Dodge. It's only a piece of metal.
Damn mind of it's own.
What?
What?
Smugglers maybe.
How long to fix?
How much longer's that gonna take?
Then we're rich. We're damn, filthy stinking rich.
Yeah, reconsider fucking his shit up.
So whoever did this might still be around.
I think you better see this for yourself.
Well, they're gonna be asking a lot of questions. About us. About those bodies. About the gold. Seems like we oughta be prepared is all.
The radio. Oh, yeah, the radio.
You smashed it!
Right.
Show your tatoos to that coxswain last night, did you Epps?
I bet you did.
Sudden flashes of light.
Salvage fees on a vessel like this could come in around four million bucks. At least. Who knows, could be more. Could be a lot more.  What I'm proposing is... we split it four ways.
Some charts. A crew manifest.  Looks like her last voyage was January 1953. The question is where the hell's she been since.
Nope.
She was a two-masted brig boat sailing out of New York in 1872.  One day she was sighted off the coast of Portugal by a merchant vessel, the Dei Gratia. As the crew of the Dei Gratia got closer, they discovered that no one was at the helm of the Mary Celeste. On boarding, they found her completely deserted. The captain, his wife, their daughter, and the entire crew, all gone. The last entry in their log made no mention of any trouble. The table was even set for dinner. And in the nine days after the last entry, she sailed 700 miles without anyone aboard.
You think she's sailing without a crew?
For now the best thing we can do is to keep quiet about this.
Greer?
Somebody took it out of commission last night.
The page's missing. Then their SOS was real.
Let 'em ask. This ship's legally ours now.
Epps, over.
Right here.
Over the gold.
If the weather holds it might not be so bad.
Murphy, don't you see what's happening?
It's the ship. The ship's making you think this way.
I don't give a damn about the gold.
I wish I could believe that. Either way, you know what I've done. I've got no choice.
What do you say, Dodge?
Besides a little rust, everything's pretty well-preserved.
Yeah.
Guess I must've fallen back to sleep. Where's Epps?
Not for fifty million. An ocean liner maybe. But fifty million in gold, they come looking for.
We'll have to take it easy then. I don't think we'll find much aboard the ship, but it's probably worth looking around.
Last thing I remember I was aboard the Chimera. Down somewhere in there scavenging around.
The mooring hasn't come taught.
Must've heard something below deck and went down to check it out.
Doesn't look like it much matters.
Leave it.
What's this?
No, no. You got leak.
How should I know?
Maxine.
I've got some important news to tell you, but it can wait till later if you're not feeling...
Well... as you know, Maxine and I have been seeing a lot of each other, and we decided it might be a good idea for all of us if she came back here to live at the end of the Summer, just so we can all get to know each other and to make sure this is what we want.
Really? I never really cared for those. Why does the fat one always have to be so mean to the skinny one?
I uh... I feel that I need to uh -- there's something I feel I have to say... I uh, I've never said this to anyone before -- believe me, I've stayed in horrible relationships for years just so I wouldn't have to do this, but I uh...
Well, no - it's more like a "found art object."
The whole business with the art show and the newspaper -- it's absolutely --
Look, I already told you I'm not going to give you a ride.
Look, I'll be done in a minute. Just wait outside.
SHH! He's back there. I can see his hair bobbing up and down.
No, I'm serious. Give us your whole basic philosophy in a nutshell.
But this guy is like a one-of-kind, rare butterfly, and we have to follow him back to his natural habitat...
I guess.
Remember that stupid hippie art teacher who failed me sophomore year? I didn't think that just because you get an "F" that means you have to take the class over again.
Just look at them!
I know, it hasn't really hit me yet.
We should follow them!
You know, sacrifice virgins and stuff...
Maybe they're slowly poisoning us or they're planning to brainwash us and --
Okay, well here's yours...  "Who said all the most eligible bachelors are taken? Not this one! Stunning bod, very snugglelicious ocean sunset dreamer."
What does it stand for?
Shh, it's his answering machine...  We hear the indistinct traces of a musical message followed by a faint BEEP.
I can't believe it!
I know... wouldn't you be totally pissed off?
I think it's cute - look at his little weasel teeth.
Ew, it's like some gross rat...
I dunno... I kind of like him... He's the exact opposite of everything I really hate... In a way he's such a clueless dork that he's almost cool...
Forget it, I can't explain it...
You just want an excuse to dress like some stupid fashion model without me making fun of you.
Should we leave a note?
Hey, you have to see my new good luck charm.
Wait...
No way... when?
He does that every single day.
You hang out with me because nobody else can stand to be around you.
You're gross.  See that guy?
Haven't you heard about the miracle of masturbation?
Seventh... you wanted to move out right then!
That must have been when my dad was married to Maxine...
If it makes you feel any better, I don't think you could've gotten more than ten bucks for all this stuff.
Well, are we still going shopping tomorrow?
No, really...
I'm sick of waiting - we need to start getting stuff if we're ever going to move.  Aren't these the greatest towels?
What happened to Seymour?
I can't believe it - he actually scored!
I just mean it's weird to me... I've never been anywhere near here in my life.
He came into work.
Why? What did he say?
Well, what am I supposed to say? "I can't wait to live in some depressing shit-hole in the middle of nowhere"?!
I need to talk to you.
I don't know - I'm not sure it's a good idea.
Just because.
Well I'm going to major in Business Administration and, I think, minor in Communications.
See, that's exactly the kind of thing we're trying to avoid. 
I'm taking a remedial high school art class for fuck-ups and retards.
Oh yeah, like he even noticed.
That's okay...
Him. Seymour. He's the man with the records.
If you really want to "fuck up the system" - you should go to business school -- that's what I'm gonna do: get a job at some big corporation and fuck things up from the inside!
Norman.
Fuck you, you stupid redneck hick!
Later, "Dude".
You're crazy -- it should be like two dollars!
Okay.
NO!!!
You're right about that.  So this is your record collection?
I mean it -- You leave everything to me -- I'm going to be your own personal dating service!
Jesus!
I'm just not one of those guys who has a "type"...
Josh? He's nobody's boyfriend... He's just this guy that Becky and I like to torture.
Well, offer her a seat! You want me to do it?
I'd rather end up like you than those people at that stupid bar...  At least you're an interesting person... at least you're not exactly like everybody else...
What are you, a fry cook or something?
Nothing so glamorous... actually, I'm an assistant manager at their corporate headquarters.
It's just my stupid back. I'll be all right in a minute...
Never mind, it's way too complicated...  Did you have problems like this when you were my age - where you're totally confused all the time?
It's just somebody's idea of a joke...
Seymour! I promise you that wasn't a joke -- you have to call her back!
What? You're kidding me...
No, actually Joe told me you were here... so how come you never call me anymore?
Sort of... she doesn't dislike any of that stuff... she's trying, anyway... actually, we're supposed to go antique shopping for her apartment this afternoon...
...so... is he your boyfriend now?
Well, you know... what do I know about clothes... I've never been the most fashionable guy -- it's nice to have someone do all the work for me...
What does she mean by that - "somebody like me"?
In whatever way you think I mean.
Can you at least let me in?
I dunno... I always feel like everybody secretly hates me. I'm just paranoid I guess. I mean, you like me don't you? We're good friends, right?
They're Seymour's.
Don't worry about it. He's not gettin' any and neither are you.
Yeah, I'm really, really happy. Really having a good time.
He has every reason to freak out -- this is a totally fucked-up thing to do to somebody!
It's my response to the issue of a woman's right to choose... it's something I feel super-strongly about.
She just mentioned him a few times and said that they had been dating - I thought maybe she was...
On that pathetic fake blind date.
What fake blind date? What are you talking about?
Do you have a check for me?
There is no reason for fear.
Games?  Look at me closely, Patterson: I am a monster. My only pleasure is tormenting people who work for me, such as yourself.  One mistake and I promise you this: I'll make you hate me.
I'm sure you've examined my record. So you know I've never yet been late on a bridge.
Don't they, though?
So work must be going well?
What have they done besides kill Starling?  How many have they killed? 
-oh please- if I'd been against your taking this, you would have abandoned me. You've been desperate to see Africa your whole life.
That is correct.  Nothing.
I assure you we came close many times-
I've got medical supplies to deliver. Come along to the hospital when you're done. 
Might be exciting for you.
What?
You mean nobody died?
We need to talk.
No, but you do-  -see, you were needed after all.  And fifty warriors at the camp before dawn.
Has it ever done that before?
...don't know...
Only in life... 
Don't they have to be?...
Actually, I could have done it much more easily without you, but for whatever reason, I'm glad you came. 
Because they are here.  Because Tsavo is the worst place in the world.  Come, John- to the bridge. 
Thank you. The truth is this: you have to work at it constantly.
This is more difficult-
Since his beard was red.
Hold your son high. 
I'm sorry.  Perhaps some other time.
No, everything's fine.  Honestly.  Thanks anyway.
I hate and despise you and everything you stand for with all my heart and soul.  I could never forgive what you've done to me and my child.
I'm trying to determine whether human emotional states have a measurable effect on the psychomagnetheric energy field.  It's a theory Ray and I were working on when we had to dissolve Ghostbusters.
No.  Not that I can recall.
Okay, okay.  It's not my job, but what the hell.  I'll do you a favor.  He takes the grocery bags from her.
As a matter of fact, I stopped by to tell you that I haven't forgotten your problem and that we're still on the case.
I'll get Ray and Egon to check out the bathtub.  You better stay here.
I'll put him down for you.  You are way too short!  And your belly-button sticks out!  You're nothing but a burden to your poor mother!
Does she know anything about babies?
Janine Melnitz, are you kidding?  Do I have a vase?  I brought some of your clothes.  Wear something intriguing.  I brought along some interesting possibilities.
Okay, but it's not a date.  It's a dinner.
I have a hamper?  Next time ask me first, okay.  I have more than two grades of laundry.  There're lots of subtle levels between clean and dirty.
I'm not even good for me.
Peter, do you think maybe I have some genetic problem or something that makes me vulnerable to these supernatural things.
Valentine's Day.  That's got to be a bummer. Where did you get that date, Elaine?
Yeah, you can get your hand off my chest.
What are you doing up here?
I was trying to get that smelly green thing. The guys asked me to help out.  I'm like the fifth Ghostbuster.
No, I celebrate at the beginning of my corporate tax year which is March first. That way I beat the crowds.
I'd like to, but I told Dr. Venkman I'd babysit.  Do you want to babysit with me?
So they bartered room and board in exchange for housekeeping services, which was a good deal for all of them because then they didn't have to withhold tax and social security, which I'm not saying is right but it's just a story, so I guess it's all right.  I can finish this later if you're tired.
How are you?  What's that you're working on, Johnny?
Yes.
Why can't you just have them released? You're a doctor.
I fixed you up with Diane Troxler and she put out, didn't she?
Yeah, I had to give her free dermabrasion for a year.  Forget it, Louis.  I could get in a lot of trouble.
They love you, Lib.  Keep it up.
Good idea.
This is about as deep as you can go under Manhattan without digging your own hole.
And we're the ...
Butt out, you pencil-necked geek.  I've had it with you.
Something good --
Okay, let's heat 'em up!
We're running tests to see if we can get an equally strong positive reaction.
Yeah, and a lot easier to get to than that island.
No, I just thought --
Wonder what?
Have I done the right thing?
Hi, Louis.
Great!  Bring her, too.  But you better hurry.  I made nachos with non-fat cheese and they're almost gone.  I'll make some more though.
This is terrible.  Either there's a monster in my kitchen or I'm completely crazy.
If it's any comfort to you, I don't think you're crazy.
On a purely scientific basis.
Okay, okay.  But if anything else happens, you have to promise you'll call me.
You must have gotten the last copy.
Well, the name Zuul refers to a demi-god worshipped around 6000 B.C. by the ... What's that say?
No, we're moving you OFF CAMPUS.  The Board of Regents has decided to terminate your grant.  You are to vacate these premises immediately.
Definitely some sort of fighting Spaniel, I think.
That's so romantic.
Keep it anyway.  I have another one at home.
Thank you.
Oh, really?  Well, I've quit better jobs than this one, believe me.
Heavens, no!  The owners don't like us to even talk about it.  I hoped we could take care of this quietly tonight.
Are you Peter Venkman?
You could say that.
See!  They are using drugs.
Yeah, yeah.  I just want to see 'em.
Oh, this is big, Peter.  This is very big. There's definitely something here.
Egon, somehow this reminds me of the time you tried to drill a hole in your head.  Do you remember that?
I'm always serious.
I blame myself.
Hey, Lady?  Lady!  Can you talk?  Who are you?   This is not working.  Think of something else.
Do you know what a patent clerk makes?  I liked the University.  They gave us money, they gave us the facilities and we didn't have to produce anything!  I've worked in the private sector.  They expect results. You've never been out of college.  You don't know what it's like out there.
My parents left me that house, I was born there.
It wasn't a date.  It was an investigation.
Sure.  Each of us is wearing an unlicensed nuclear accelerator on our back.  No problem.
All right.  Let's cool the negative vibes. These things can sense them.
Well, that ought to do it.
Well, has it ever occurred to you that the reason you've been so busy lately is because the dead have been rising from their graves?
For the gods, spit it out!
The fans of Narcissus.  They were on vigil outside the school of Proximo. They believe he's dying.
You can't do that... listen to the mood of the crowd.
You want control of the crowd -- you can't get it by killing their hero.
Or perhaps into a new one.  But here's to your God and the courage of our legions...
Do we really need to repair this fort?  It seems like an expensive undertaking.  I propose we burn it to the ground.  That way if the Germans cross the Danube here there will be nothing to help them build an offensive position.
You flatter me, Caesar.
At least stay for the running of the animals.  You are paying for it you know...
You don't want to kill him.  If anything happens to him now you will be blamed... and he knows it. Besides, that gladiator school is a fortress.  It would take the army to break in there.  What you want is to... offer him the wooden sword. If he takes it, he's no longer the champion of the people, is he?  He's gone.  And you are a hero for awarding it.
The trouble is defining exactly what 'right' is.
You're a citizen and a soldier.  Not a gladiator.
It's not because he's young, it's because he's ignorant and arrogant. His sister is a better man.  That's why I have undertaken to begin sweeping changes in the relationship between the emperor and the Senate.
Everyone talking about it?  I wouldn't wonder.  All I seek is a genuine balance of power between the Emperor and the Senate.  Thus I have transferred legal power -- which was theirs to begin with -- back to the Senators.  This includes a shared right to taxation too but some bite in the plan.  It's a start, only a start.  If the Emperor and the Senate can share power then the people will be ready to take their share.  This means Commodus has to bend; does he strike you as that type?
Tomorrow?
Well, we can try...
The 'people'?, listen to the people, they know what they want:  A government that gives them what they need and doesn't bother them with messy thoughts of issues.  You know, messy... thinking.  They want a dictator!  As far as the children, there is only one thing that every Roman child dreams of:  being you! A famous gladiator!
Can you stop that slaughter?!  Can you free these men?
Me?  Well, I believe in Rome... you'd have to after what I've seen, how people outside the empire treat each other.
No!
-- to fight?  We'll see...
Think about it!  Just think about it!
Lucky it didn't step on his head.
Make us rich, Proximo, make us very rich...
Spend my days beheading country bumpkins?  I don't know, Proximo, who has better wine than you? Besides, I'm beginning to think of the Colosseum as my home.
No.  Tell them I'll do it.  But I want more posters all over Rome.
Right, right, what am I thinking of?
I want another interview with Cos. Tell him to bring plenty of ink.
No, I couldn't.
All right.
You're the first -- you're the first thing for so long that I've liked. The first person I could stand to be with.
That woman --
Where did he say he was going to meet you?
Here? In Berkeley?
Yes.
Well, I have this very pleasant room on Carter Street -- and I've been getting to some classes --
Come in.
Because -- I am.
What do you think?
Elaine -- I love you.
How could you do that, Benjamin?
I might.
Tomorrow?
Carl who?
Who -- that guy at the Zoo?
He said he thought we'd make a pretty good team.
I certainly hope you --
There is a great future in plastics. Think about it. Will you think about it?
I want you out of here.
Get out!
Did you get a room?
It's in the main ballroom.
I mean I'd -- I'd rather not go to the trouble of bringing it all in. I just have a toothbrush. I can get it myself. If that's all right.
Of course.
Fine, thank you. The bathroom is down at the end of the hall.
Is what a girl?
What?
Right.
Well, why can't you just lock the doors and go to bed?
What?
Mrs. Robinson, will you forgive me for what I just said?
What is wrong with me?
Very much.
Will you unzip my dress?
Is that what you're trying to tell me?
I'm going home now. I apologize for what I said. I hope you can forget it. But I'm going home right now.
Do you understand what I said?
Why don't you get it.
That's fine.
Isn't there something you want to tell me?
What?
I'll get undressed now. Is that all right?
Benjamin -- do you find me undesirable?
-- of bring -- inadequate -- I mean just because you happen to be inadequate in one way --
Good. I mean are we dead or something?
All we ever do is come up here and throw off the clothes and leap into bed together.
I'm not. No. But do you think we could liven it up with a few words now and then?
Well?
How about art.
Art. That's a good subject. You start it off.
What one.
He's asleep.
We're talking, Mrs. Robinson. We're talking.
Now. You say the driveway's on your side of the house. So I guess you don't sleep in the same room.
So you don't -- I mean I don't like to seem like I'm prying but I guess you don't sleep together or anything.
What?
I never did, Benjamin. Now let's --
Wait a minute. Wait a minute. So how did it happen?
Was he a law student at the time?
We'd go to his car.
There's nothing to tell.
But why shouldn't I?
Benjamin?
No sir. I am not proud that I spend my time with a broken-down alcoholic!
Mrs. Robinson, you stand there and tell me I'm not good enough for your daughter.
Did I say that?
That's all right. I think I can understand why I'm disgusting to you.
It's not! I enjoy it! I look forward to it. It's the one thing I have to look forward to.
All right, for christ's sake. I promise I will never take out Elaine Robinson.
I can makes things quite unpleasant.
I'll find her.
I don't think so.
I'd like you to know my sister, Miss DeWitte --
Then what do you do? Do you meet someone?
Meet someone?
I don't know. I want it to be --
Now listen, Ben. I think it's a very good thing that a young man -- after he's done some very good work -- should have a chance to relax and enjoy himself, and lie around, and drink beer and so on. But after a few weeks I believe that person would want to take some stock in himself and his situation and start to think about getting off his ass.
Standing guard over the old castle, are you?
Yes, sir.
Oh no.
That's a hell of a good age to be.
Thank you.
I wish I was that age again. Because, Ben --
Sir?
You'll never be young again.
Yes, sir.
Oh yes.
I will.
I am not threatening you.
The point is -- I don't love your wife. I love your daughter, sir.
And what are you going to do?
The pearls are in her room.
Now listen to me. The others are getting suspicious of you. I was on the telephone to Amsterdam today, they think you're scared.
How?
I'm not going to get those pearls and neither are you.
I have an idea working in my head... 
Oh, my large and noisy neighbor -- really? That? 
You?
Oh -- work!!
Oh!
Money -- Ever heard of it?
Unfortunately no -- to bad -- tomorrow though.
Yellow Room where they dance -- 
I fell in love last night -- the real thing.
Yes --
Why do you hide in my room?
I was so alone -- always alone -- and suddenly you were there and said that.  No. I am not afraid. It is strange.
Don't cry -- it tears my heart to see you sob like that.
Certainly.
And -- and --
Strange man...
Am I quite strange to you?
Yes -- I do understand.
I'm not going -- You know I'm not going -- Let me stay here?
Because I can see something in the mirror that you cannot. My dear -- 
Beautiful but so sad. I did not know it was so dangerous to look into a woman's bedroom.
I want to be alone.
Flix. -- And how do you live? What kind of a person are you?
But now, you must go... I give you the pearls. But now you must go ---
And now?
I have no money now -- I must get some first -- I must get some.
Not at all, sir. 
Permit me -- my name is Kringelein -- from Fredersdorf.
Hello, Mr. Kringelein. How do you feel now?
If we could scare up some men to play.
Good!
No -- not at all.
Certainly -- always when Grusinskaya dances.
The war dropped him here and forgot him.
Look here, sir -- I'm completely at your mercy -- I'm desperate -- it's a matter of life or death -- I had to get some money -- tonight.
Telegrams?
No, doctor.
Yes -- Oh -- oh -- yes, -- 
No - absinthe.
You don't like to see me enjoying myself.
You loved the Baron, didn't you?
Then why did you have anything to do with him?
Of course I do -- I never knew what money really meant till I started spending it. Do you know --  I can hardly believe that anything so beautiful should come to me from Preysing -- I'll take care of you. Will -- will you let me?
I'm the stenographer.
Moreover...
...weight into the balance...
Is that Mrs. Preysing.
Oh -- too bad. Did you quarrel? 
I must speak to you, Miss Flaemm -- business.
Tomorrow morning.
Do you gentlemen know each other, Mr. Kringelein -- Mr. Preysing -- Baron von Gaigern.
Well?
I understand perfectly.
Of course -- of course. 
I had to arrange about the trip.
All right.
Mop rags --!
All you have to do is phone for it.
What a session this has been.
Now is the time to cancel to stop entirely. I feel it -- everything tells me -- enough -- enough.
When a lady falls in love she does her hair differently.
In the middle of the night -- those flowers make me think of a funeral. Laurels and tube-roses.  Oh, think, Suzette -- the Villa and the sun at Tremezzo -- quiet -- simple -- happy -- we'll have a guest, Suzette.
Oh!
Such nonsense.
Wait a minute. I've got to ask myself.
What -- what is it? Last night...
Please.
No -- no -- wait -- the man was a burglar -- he was going to steal my money.
Where is that girl -- she was working with him -- she enticed me into her room.
I can answer for this, it was self- defense -- I can answer for this -- but that girl -- the scandal -- my wife -- my daughters, you know them?
The scandal -- we are men -- you -- you could take that affair of the young lady upon yourself -- take her and hold your tongue. Then you can travel -- I'll give you anything -- anything -- she was with you.
We must call the police, your excellency.
Have I kept you waiting?
No news yet?
Bluff -- Bluff -- all bluff.
Zinnowitz, would you say she was pretty?
I want to keep my teeth.
You want a drink?
A person that don't look out for himself is too dumb to look out for anybody else. He's a liability, right, Bobo?
You know it, Lilly.
Oh, everything's the same size, same price.
You're right! And this boy tapped into that main link between Tokyo and the New York Stock Exchange. He can give us, when it's really useful, a seven second delay in that movement of information. Do you know what that means?
Seven seconds. I don't see how you do it.
Mrs. Dillon, your son was in some sort of accident. He's had an internal hemorrhage, he's bleeding to death inside.
His blood pressure is under a hundred. I don't think he'll live to get to the hospital.
You know who I work for.
Why? What's wrong?
But what's wrong?
But they must be! They cut glass!
Why, of course it is. I can offer you -- well, five hundred dollars.
Lead on.
I didn't realize. Yeah, you do look a little pale. How soon will you be ready? A week?
Well...
I guess I owe you my life.
You don't have the stomach for it.
Somewhere else, that's for sure.
No, you wouldn't. That's what she was after, though. But why hit on me?
As though you do what I say.
You've already made a start. Doesn't look that clean, though.
Don't be sorry. You're not taking it.
What?
NO!
This time...
In your other hand.
You called the doctor, huh?
Every day in every way.
I'll see you when you get home.
See you soon.
Working the what?
You're on the grift. Same as me.
I've heard the name.
He'd explain he had to have cash, so there wouldn't be any paper trail for the SEC. And a lot of cash, or it wasn't worth while. The least we ever took was forty thousand, and the most was one hundred eighty-five thousand dollars! From one sucker!
Yeah? How?
Where?
Take a hike, you mean?
I went out to Delmar.
Wait a minute! When did this happen, that we're partners?
The last I looked, we were just talking things over.
But the setup's there. It's there now.
That's what I say.
No; history. Sooner or later, the lightning hits. I don't want to be around when it hits you.
Well, let's get the shock over with.
Sickness comes to us all, Mister Dillon.
It's Blake.  Meet me at Grand View.
Charming.
I think someone broke into my house.
Checking out your place.
And miss the big game?  No way.
Don't think so.  But they sure did a real number on your office. Crap everywhere.
You're so predictable.
To the bathroom.  Can I do that alone or do you want to watch?
What?  Where is she?
John...
Alright.  I'll come out.  Just be quiet.
Looks great.  It does.
It's not going to happen.
Bye Will.
Are you going to leave, too?
You say, "The key to my heart," and I'm gonna hurl.
You're so easy...
Nope.  Hey, you think I'll win scariest costume?
Have enough fun for the both of us.
Shit, Beth, why do we have to be the ones to organnize this friggin' fair? It's only Halloween.
Answer what?
You can't expect us to stay here --
There's nothing to be scared of, baby. It's just another storm.  Try to get some sleep.
A man came by the house.  A psychiatrist by the name of Loomis.
I've come to help your family.
Black magic ...  'In ancient times, Thorn was believed to cause sickness, famine and death. Translated literally, it was the name of a demon spirit that delivered human sacrifices ... on the Celtic celebration of Samhain.'
'When applied directly to another person, Thorn could be used to call upon them confusion and destruction -- to literally visit them with the Devil.'
It was Jamie Lloyd.  She came back, as I knew she would one day.  And whatever has brought her back has brought Michael back as well.
I'll meet you over there.
I know he's alive.  People in this town -- they want us to believe he's dead.  But I know. I've always known.
It's a bitch.
I'm gonna wet my pants.
I'd really feel stupid if we didn't bring anything back home.
Go home!
Thank God we found the fucking diamonds!
Go home.
So long, Colonel.
Good night, Colonel.  It's been beautiful.
You ever own a motorcycle?
You told me.
You'd get this funny look in your eyes, and I'd say to myself, "Oh, Jesus--he's going to tell me what a retiarius is again."
It helped more than you know.  Down deep, people were deeply affected.
You're so low!  Look at that beautiful red meat.  You haven't touched it.
I wouldn't want to be married to me. We're too crazy.  You know?
Tit for tat--as simple as that.
You.
If I hadn't done it.  If I'd said to myself, "Screw it.  I'm going to let all those people down there live."
They were enemies.  We were at war.
I just want one true adventure before I die.
We got to get another pilot.
Hello.
Hello.
Are you--
She went to the fight with Herb Shuttle, I guess.
I was going to a funny movie, but I changed my mind.  If you're depressed, laughing doesn't help much.  When did you know my father?
Even this--"Herb Shuttle", you said?
Ah!  And what sort of man is this worshiper?
What a pity!  Educating a beautiful woman is like pouring honey into a fine Swiss watch.  Everything stops.  And the doctor?  He worships your father, too?
He was a stretcher-bearer in the Korean War.  Were you in a war with Father?
Behind a desk for a little while.  A desk!  They had him planning air raids.  A city can't flee like a coward or fight like a man, and the choice between fleeing and fighting was at the core of the life of Harold Ryan.  There was only one thing he enjoyed more than watching someone make that choice, and that was making the choice himself.  Ask about Spain, where he was the youngest soldier in the Abraham Lincoln Brigade.  He was a famous sniper.  They called him "La Picadura"--"the sting."
Wow.
Uck.
Don't care for cold steel?  A knife is worse than a bullet?
It's rather a disappointment these days.  It isn't there any more.
The Germans shot everybody who lived there, then leveled it, plowed it, planted turnips and cabbages in the fertile ground. They wished revenge for the slaying of the Beast of Yugoslavia.  To their twisted way of thinking, your father had butchered an Eagle Scout.  Play lots of contact sports?
She's a real heavy sleeper sometimes.
Can I get dressed first?
Leave a tip.
Beat the shit out of someone who hates you.
No.
Of course it is.  Is it loaded?
I don't want to fight you.
Yes, sir.  It was a very unusual automobile. It was a Cadillac, but it had water buffalo horns where the bumpers should be.  And what to drink?
I couldn't help overhearing that you were about to get married again.
Situation.
Seemed the most honest way to begin life together again--natural, unrehearsed.
You and your damned bedside manner and your damned little black bag full of miracles.  You know who filled that bag for you?  Not Alice-sit-by-the-fires like yourself.  Men with guts filled it, by God--men with guts enough to pay the price for miracles--suffering, ingratitude, loneliness, death--
Ghastly, cruel, unnecessary.
We all do.  But now it's body time. Relax.  Ideally, the body of a woman should feel like a hot water bottle filled with Devonshire cream. You feel like a paper bag crammed with curtain rods.  Think of your muscles one by one.  Let them go slack.  Relax.  Let the brain go blank.  Relax.  That's the idea-- that's my girl.  Now the small of the back.  Let those knots over those kidneys unsnarl.
All right--bring me a side order of Mrs. Wheeler.  Oh, hell--sit down, Colonel. Penelope will bring you some chow.
Fish can't feel.
And they have very mixed feelings about women.  They hate them in a way.  One reason they like war so much is that they can capture enemy women and not have to make love to them slowly and gently.  They can scrog them, as you say--  for revenge.
Yes.
His most cherished possession?  His violin, I guess.
And no one's there now?
No you're not!
I came for Paul as well.
He'd never seen a corpse.  He's seen a dozen now.
I want you to tell me that you loved me once.
Last I heard, his mother was going alone.
Then you'd better fix your bayonet, because there aren't any bullets in the gun.
There it is.  Give it to me.
Then listen to me.  You're both disgusting--with your pride, your pride.  I hate you for coming here--like a federal marshal in a western film. I loved you when you stayed away. But here you are now--high noon in the Superbowl!  You fool, you fool.
You've killed women?
Do it, Norbert.
It's always locked.
We tried to be.  We tried to be.
He's dead, you know.
We'll miss you so.
Will you please go?  An emergency!
I've literally got to run!
I came back.
I was going to ask.
Pacqualinincheewa root.  Means "cougar fang." Cures anything but a yellow streak down the back.
What for?
We do survive, don't we?  You're going to have to apologize, of course, for calling me a bastard. That's a matter of form--not allowing you or anybody to call me a bastard.  No rush about that. Just remember to apologize sometime soon.
I'm to be left behind--in primordial ooze?
No quarter asked.  No quarter given.
Poison.
You can never take yourself seriously again!  Look at all the creatures you've protected us from! Did you shoot them on the elevator, as they were on their way up here to eat us alive?
You aren't going to hurt me.  You aren't going to hurt anybody any more.  Any violent gesture will seem ridiculous--to yourself!
You're making a mistake.  Obsolete old carnivores like me are most dangerous when wounded.  You've wounded me.
So that's it! "Kestenbaum, Kestenbaum." Everybody was yelling "Kestenbaum, Kestenbaum." I thought it was some foreign language.
Thought you were another wife, maybe.
Is it?  I have this theory about why men kill each other and break things.
Something's made you sore.
You bet I'll worry about it.  I said something wrong?
It's my father's birthday--that's all.  That's all.  Who cares about that?
I had not the slightest inkling.  Why didn't you say so?
Kid--kid--
Everybody talks about how rotten kids act.  Grownups can be pretty rotten, too.
Wouldn't you rather have your mother marry me than him?
Still lives with his mother.
It's beautiful.
It is you, isn't it, Harold?
Okay.
I'll get ready, Herb.  I didn't expect you this soon.  Please--won't everybody be nice to everybody else while I'm gone?
He'd kill me.  He'd be right to kill me, too--the kind of guy he is.
I don't want to go to Vanderbilt.
I see.
You figure!
A what?
Thank you, Herb.  You're a wonderful man.  You really are. Everybody respects you for what you've done for scouting and the Little League.
I'm saying no--and thank you.
I didn't make my move fast enough. That's it, isn't it?  I was too respectful.
She quit this afternoon.
Throw out all this junk.  Burn it! This room crawls with tropical disease.
It is?
We've got to dump Shuttle.  He brings his vacuum cleaner on dates?
To show myself how brave I am.  The issue's in doubt, you know--since I'm always for peace--
We've got to rescue him.
If he is in the park, luck is all that can save him now, and there's plenty of that.
It's a jungle out there.
We met here earlier this evening.
Tell her to have a nice trip.
I'm glad you brought your vacuum cleaner.
Is that a fact?
That's not true either--or needn't be, unless we make it true.
Chinese maniacs and Russian maniacs and American maniacs and French maniacs and British maniacs have turned this lovely, moist, nourishing blue-green ball into a doomsday device.  Let a radar set and a computer mistake a hawk or a meteor for a missile, and that's the end of mankind.
You're preparing him for a career in the slaughterhouses of Dubuque?  Take care of your body, yes!  But don't become a bender of horseshoes and railroad spikes.  Don't become obsessed by your musculature.  Any one of these poor, dead animals here was a thousand times the athlete you can ever hope to be. Their magic was in their muscles. Your magic is in your brains!
What a beautiful demonstration this is of the utter necessity of rites of passage.
I feel like I've been double- crossed.  If you'd just told me it was Harold's birthday--
It was almost worth the trip--to find out that Jesus Christ in Heaven was just another guy, playing shuffleboard.  I like his sense of humor, though--you know? He's got a blue-and-gold warm-up jacket he wears.  You know what it says on the back? "Pontius Pilate Athletic Club." Most people don't get it.  Most people think there really is a Pontius Pilate Athletic Club.
You sure? We have regular sessions, too. Only twenty dollars?
There's something wrong here. Kristen is not the type of girl to just up and leave.
If he has anything to say about it, yeah. I've been asking a lot of questions and I don't like the answers I'm getting. He's made a lot of people nervous, including some poor faggot who thought he was going to be a movie star.
Do you want to take a session?
You may do that in the privacy of your room.
What?
What do you mean?
Just one.
We offer...
I'm looking for Tod. Is he in?
I was told there was a real nice girl here named Joanne. Quite young.
I like it, Mr. Van Dorn.
Yeah, overpowering. That was the word I was looking for.
Yeah. How did you know?
No.
You know her?
When do we start?
Ulcers.
Jesus.
And your wife? Where's she?
Hey, don't worry about it. Your daughter's around. We'll find her in a couple days.
Okay, tell me. Why do you live like you do?
What does that mean?  What does he do?
Yeah.  Well, mostly.
Just a guess. She ain't dead though is she?
Don't get upset. I lied too. I don't make no five hundred dollars a week. Everything I make goes to Granville.
...What do you have to offer?
If I was you, Mr. Mast, I'd watch my language.
What have you found out?
What do you mean?
Do you know what a "hardcore" movie is?
Where did you get that film?
But this is my apartment.
Don't do anything more. I'll find out what I can.
Does she know anything about this?
Yeah. She's quite upset. I'm going to fly out today. They want me to bring some pictures.
Leave me alone. Go home. Go away.
You don't want to know.  Now, Wes, leave, please. For me.
Do you work for the San Francisco Police Department, or do you have any other affiliation with any law enforcement agency?
I want to meet Ratan.
Yeah. I heard you and Ratan just came from Mexico. And that you had a film of a girl being, ah you know...
Is this with a girl named Kristen?
Okay.
I don't know what you're talking about.
You ain't goin' nowhere alone.
I don't know nothing, man.
No.
Not exactly...
What do you think of that? Or this?
You never heard of that?
I'm worried about Jake.
I'm off that case. He fired me.
Who's that?
Well, he can just fuck himself.
'Was.' He and that shitheel Ratan went down to T-J. Maybe I shouldn't say that. Anyway, I hear he's back in Frisco now.
Yes, I am.
I just don't think we have one, unless it's in the glove compartment. Could you look, Harold?
Out!
Not very.
Me neither. I heard he was eighty years old. I'll be eighty next week. A good time to move on, don't you think?
Harold Chasen.
Do you sing and dance?
Well, it's a new experience for me.  Good on curves. Shall I take you home, Harold?
Yearse!
Well, if some people are upset because they feel they have a hold on some things, then I'm merely acting as a gentle reminder - I'm sort of breaking it easy -- Here today, gone tomorrow, so don't get attached to <u>things</u>. Now, with that in mind, I'm not against collecting stuff...
Well, then, you must come back and visit.
She seemed yare to me.
It goes on and on.
Sterling silver. It was my dear mother-in-law's, part of a dinner set of fifty pieces. It's one of the few things that survived.  Oh, but I do rattle on so. Tell me about yourself, Harold.  What do you do when you aren't visiting funerals?
Oooh, but they are not. Look.
An ice sculpture. It's Venus - the Goddess of Love, the completion of which is his unfulfilled dream.
Yes.
I've never met her. My mother set it up.
... of you. You'll all end up like this.
I don't know. Perhaps.
Oh, Harold. 
I thought eighty was a good round number.
I'm getting married.
Perhaps it is.
Fifteen.
No, I suppose not. How do you feel about your mother?
Yes. It does.
No.
Huh?
Yes.
Your classmates?
Then why did you leave?
I'd have liked to talk to him.
Jeez, sir. That's pretty strong stuff.
I hope so, sir. Golly I never knew it could be so exciting.
Oh sure.
Crazy parasite! Commie bastard! Get out of here.
She's a Commie pig. We're going to nail every last one...
Well, I didn't.
You knew?
What's the matter with her?
Kyle, you don't have...
Steve...
Don't worry. He's O.K. We sent him home hours ago. Jeez, what a story.
See what??
I break it, they see us, Happy Halloween. No more hiding.  Outside. I could be outside --
Half transmission. Nonsense -- German ghost stories!
Karl Ruprecht Kroenen, one of the Reich's top Scientists. Head of the Thule Occult Society.
There is a place -- a dark place where evil slumbers and awaits to return. From there it infects our dreams. Our thoughts. Grigory gave us a glance tonight --
Grigory Yefimovich Rasputin --
Well, I won't be around forever, you know?
1945, you mean. Hitler died in '45.
Oh, please. I'm not "pure of heart."
Agent Myers is your new liaison.
Nah. I'll be around, Red, just back in the field.
"Myers", huh? You have a first name??
I can live with that.
When we do: No mumbo-jumbo. Double- core Vulcan-65 grenades.
Each of us gets a belt.
You call that thing a cigar??
My job.
No, no, no, it's fine: I do my job, I take a break.
Could've fooled me. Go away.
Well good n-
Just a scratch.  I wanted to see you.
Good.
My uncle used to say... we like people for their qualities but love them for their defects.
What -- ?
Pardon?
Who are you calling a fucking ass- hole? It's this bastard bed that's your fucking problem!
You solved the box. We came. Now you must come with us. Taste our pleasures.
No tears please. It's a waste of good suffering.
HE did. I've seen him.
It's important.
I'm sorry. Of course. You're very welcome.
Forget him.
I'm very happy.
What do you want me to do.
Better. Very much better. I'd like something to wear. And some cigarettes. Will you bring me some?
Not know.
Yes. They'll never find us.
There's a towel in the bathroom.
This afternoon.
We'll sell it. Sell everything.
What's wrong with you?
What are you talking about?
I try not to drink at lunch-time. Makes me sleepy in the afternoon. You like to keep a clear head, eh?  One soda, one whisky.  I do it anyway. No will-power. Got a busy afternoon?
There's a first time for everything.
No, not much.
Am I?
My father doesn't answer. I have to go find him.
Steve.
I found a room.
I do. I'd just feel happier if you were with us.
Me like.
Surprise.
I've forgotten.
It's like she's waiting for something.
Sure.
Of course.
I don't believe it.
Show her.
That's right. Cointreau.
Just upstairs.
What do we do if there isn't?
I've been better.
No, it's good to see you.
IT WON'T GO ANY LOUDER.
Bullshit.  The guy was going to buy one record -- which we didn't even have -- and leave and never come back again anyway.  Why not have a little fun?  Big fucking deal.
What am I missing?  What do you have to be happy about?
Shut up. "Let's Get It On," Marvin Gaye, from Let's Get It On. "Airbag," Radiohead, from OK Computer.
But in your opinion, would I definitely go?
My band.
Liar.  We saw it in the Lawrence Kasdan double-bill with Body Heat.
Not really.
I heard you, man.  Don't give me that "what" shit.  You just told them that you're gonna put out a record with them.
We're getting that anyway.
We're not as bad as you think, Rob.
It's the new --
On Clark Street!
We work there!
He's not worth it!
Where's Rob?
I'm Caroline Fortis from The Reader. I want to do a story on you.
Right.  Why?
What do you mean, four more?
What's his name?
Oh, well, the Kinky Wizards are -- you know what?  Why don't I just make you a tape?
Why did you break up with me for Marco?
Can I help you?
Fine.
I want a tape.
Marie LaSalle is in the store!  Here, she's here, and now!
-- FUCK OFF!
I am fine...  I gotta go.  Goodbye.
Mmmm, no.  Not a good idea.
Conflict resolution is my job, Laura.
Funnily enough I haven't been too thrilled about it.
I dunno.
I dunno.
I thought I could give you a lift back.
-- and who says I like Marvin Gaye, anyway?
Yeah, sure.  More so then than I am now.  That's life though, isn't it?
What?  Gimme a fucking break.  Is that what you think?  That your not big enough a deal for me?  Jesus, gimme a little credit, Rob.
I don't know.  It's one of the things I thought of.
What's the obvious stuff?
I don't know.
Well then why don't you quit it while you seem to not be ahead?
Is it better?
I don't know.
I think the big question here is where are you, if you don't mind my saying so, and I think I know where you are.  You're running.  On the run.  You're running from a point that everyone hits in any relationship, and you're just going to hit it again with Ian but it's going to be with a World Music bunny- rabbit-looking earth-shoe-wearing "Doctor Who"-watching twit who doesn't really understand you, not the way that I do and will more in the future, and you'll have just wasted more time and arrive in the exact same place that you're in now, only later. And with... him.
I don't want to.  Don't need to.  I love you.
He's at home.  Listen, I can't believe he went to the store.  I'm mortified, actually.  I'm really sorry.  He had no right to do that, and I told him so.
I hate him too.  So I just call him "Mavis." Or "Sissyboy." Or "Mavis the Sissyboy."
They're not really, though, are they? I know you bought them for me, and that was really sweet of you, but that was when you were trying to turn me into you.  I can't take them, I know they'd just sit around staring at me, and I'd feel embarrassed by them and... they don't fit in with the rest of what's mine, do you understand?  That Sting record you bought for me... that was a present for me.  I like Sting and you hate him.  But the rest of this stuff...  Who the hell is Nick Lowe?  Or Gram Parsons?  Or the Boredoms?  I don't know these people.  I...
Sure.  I'll see you on Friday.
Mmnn.
Yes, of course.  There's nothing to worry about.
I didn't mean that.  I mean... was that all you used?
I can't go to work with my hair dyed pink.  And I can afford to go shopping more now, and I've met a couple people I like over the last year or so.
Hi.  What are you doing?
Nothing.
I'm going to talk to you about whether you want to get married or not.  To me.
I mean it.
I know.
Hey.  It's Liz.
What's happenin'.
Enough of what?
Maybe I've been a little unfair. But is this really the time?
Good.
God, I hate that time.  That pick up stuff time.  I just went through that before I came here.  You know that song "Patsy Cline Times Two" I play?  That's about me and my ex dividing up our record collections.
It's a great song.
Yes.  You?
God, you ask a lot of questions.
It's got nothing to do with marriage, if that's what you're getting at.
That's why I'm trying to compromise. What about fifteen-hundred?  They're worth five times that.
Fine.
Oh, come on!  Let me give you ten dollars for this, and you can give the rest away for all I care.
Well we don't.
We're not there yet, Justin.
Some guy named Smith was asking about him in Church Hill.  I passed his name around with your buddies downtown but they drew a blank.  So he isn't a cop.  District anyway.
Claymore.
Huh?
Don't know about any of that. Suppose nobody does.
There was this one fella.  Asked a lot of questions.  I was out of town but I heard he spent near a full day in the records office.
Very traditional.
-All but one out of a hundred, I know.  All left to be led like donkeys back home.  Now if you will please-
He called you "MacLeod".
You?
Are you?
You had to do _nothing_!
You make it all sound so simple.
The only real difficulty comes in changing over the ownership of property I've aquired.  That requires certain records and most importantly a personal appearance at the county seat in Gettysburg.  But that's where you come in.
I wish I could.
I thought it might be a nice break from all of this.
Yes.
I'm not even sure why.
Hardly a reason to run off with a murderer.
You are a very perceptive young woman.
Of bodies.
You kill with your left hand?
Is that a threat?
All of it finished.
Yes.
I've got a morgue filling up with bodies.  That's my right.
You're an asshole, Moran.
You always were hard to impress.
You see that desk?  _Your_ desk?  You see the crap piled up on it?
-In nomine sanctus esperitu-
You're not from these parts.
Aye.
You know me home.  Me name.
Yes.  Always.
You feel you know me.
You recall how I spoke of the push you feel and how I make it less?
Hide.  Run to the ends of the Earth till you learn.  You must learn to defend yourself.  In this I can help.
Go to hell.
I am a small player.  But if by helping you I can keep that monster from being the last, then perhaps my life has meant something.
I am not ready for this.
Of course.
But I did live.
Leave me alone, Conor.  Please.
You surprise me.  Eliminating a rival like that.  Such are the actions of a man of conquest.  I was mistaken.  300 years have turned the boy's fear into ambit- ion.
So sure?
My father taught me.
What name is he using?
He got him.  He always does.  Eventually.
He knows I'm here.  How?
It's good to see you, Kahn.
Neuvich, the clown of the crusades.
But then rides up Pope Pius who calmly brushes the dust from his papal cross, climbs off his papal horse, draws his papal sword and asks just what the hell is going on.  And what did Neuvich, dear dear drunken Neuvich do?
How do you do it, Kahn?  How do you live so full of life for so long?
Tasting and enjoying life is the only thing of value we have.  All else is just marking time.  You're marking time.
You don't run as hard, MacLeod. You just don't run as hard anymore.
Of sorts.
I do hope she enjoys a good show.
I want you to come to me.
Yes.
I was walking by when I heard a shout.  Your men came right after.
No.
It doesn't.
He was carrying a Syrian passport and had been in the country less than a week.
American.
That's none of your business.
For the moment.
Oh yes, more than enough.
We were very close.
Yes sir.  When you get older your priorities change.  It's the simple things that count.  Without them growing old can be a very lonely thing.
A double guard's been thrown around the jail, municipal buildings, railroad terminals, and elevated stations to prepare for the expected general uprising of radicals at the hour of execution.
No, just a farewell appearance, batting for Sweeney. I'm going into business for myself.
Seventy-five.
Au revoir, mon capitaine.
My job, Bruce. I started it -- and I'll finish it.
Well, at his age, twenty payment life, a little over a thousand dollars.
And what's the matter with a thousand dollars?
I lost my wallet.
The check, Bruce!
The Criminal Courts Building.
But, gee, Hildy -- he gave us that insurance business -- and you promised --
Bruce, you know I'm mad about you and stop talking like that.  Walter!
Then suppose you give me the money. Four hundred and fifty dollars.
Thank you.
I'm Bruce Baldwin!
You see, my wife -- I mean, your wife -- that is, I mean Hildy -- had led me to expect that she was marrying a much older man.
Where are we going?
Well, I honestly feel that way. I figure I'm in one line of business that really helps people. Of course, we don't help you much when you're alive -- but afterward -- that's what counts.
Well, of course, if you put it that way.
Get out!
What did you say your name was -- Pinkus?
Done what?
Divorced me. It sort of makes a fellow lose faith in himself. It almost gives him a feeling he wasn't wanted.
Well, I don't want to brag, but I've still got the dimple -- and in the same place -- I just acted like any husband who doesn't want to see his home broken up.
Well, suppose we did? That isn't what I got married for. What's the good of -- Look, Walter, I came up here to tell you that you'll have to stop phoning me a dozen times a day -- sending twenty telegrams -- all the rest of it, because I'm --
What?!!
I haven't any hard feelings.
You mean you're not coming back to work here?
That's the first time you've been right today. That's what I --
Why should I? I thought it would be a novelty to have a face around here a man could look at without shuddering.
I don't care whether he did or not. He's supposed to be covering the Earl Williams case and there he is -- waiting at the hospital! Is there no sense of honor left in this country?
Get away, Svengali.
You can't sell me that, Walter.
Say, sounds more like a guy I ought to marry. What's his name?
Well, I'll give you a hint. By tomorrow they'll be calling me Mrs. Bruce Baldwin.
Now you got me.
Because it happened to be a colored policeman.
Oh, nothing! Of course, you might cancel the check. Yes! Wait a minute! What would be his first payment on that policy?
It cost me four hundred and fifty bucks to tear it out of Cooley.
No, this is on the level, Walter. I'm not good enough to make this one up. The Sheriff gave his gun to the Professor, the Professor gave it to Earl, and Earl gave it right back to the Professor -- right in the stomach! Who? No, Egelhoffer wasn't hurt badly. They took him to the County Hospital where they're afraid he'll recover.
Hold on a minute.
You know! You've got the brain of a pancake! That wasn't just a story you covered -- it was a revolution! Hildy! This is the greatest yarn in journalism since Livingstone discovered Stanley for the New York Herald! 
Wait a minute -- wasn't it Stanley who discovered Livingstone?
Where's Bruce?
You been in a fight?
What am I going to say to Bruce? What'll I tell him?
If it was my own mother, I'd carry on! You know I would. For the paper!
Don't tell me you were worried!
Uh-uh. As long as we were in there together pitching -- they couldn't lick us. Well, it's been a lot of fun.
Yeah - but that time we stole Old Lady Haggerty's stomach off the Coroner's physician. We proved she was poisoned though, didn't we?
On the nine o'clock train. That's the one he took, isn't it?
Sure, I can't last forever. I want a son I can train to take my place on this paper.
Well, I'd like to be lady-like and think it over.
Walter, you can't do that!
It'll be Heaven!
Now everything's fine. She's probably squawking her head off in some police station.
Who do you want?
Sure, boss.
I'm busy, Duffy.
First we talk. How did Earl Williams get that gun?
Came up here -- had hysterics and passed out. I've been trying to get her to come to.
Now, where is he?
Oh, that'll be all right, Hildy. Go ahead, run it. And you can say I treated him well, too.  'Lo, Earl. How are you feeling?
They got him!  Wait a minute -- hold the wire.  They got Earl Williams surrounded -- the Riot Squad has -- in his house.
Tell 'em to hold the wire.
Now what do you say?
I don't know, Fred. There's that reprieve if they ever find out.
I was just going to!
Yeah, you don't want to tire him out, Doctor.
And who accused him? Diamond Louis! One of the worst crooks in town! Why don't you arrest Louis instead of innocent people that he frames?
I can't.
Phone for you, Hildy.
I'll go right after it.
This is Hildy Johnson...  Oh, I can give it up all right. Without a single quiver. I'm going to live like a human being -- not like you rats.  Oh, is that you, Walter dear? Oh, I didn't mean "dear." That was just habit, I guess. Oh, be yourself, Walter. I've got some news for you... Yes, I got the interview, but I've got some news that's more important.
Of course not. I couldn't kill anybody -- it's against everything I've ever stood for. They know it was an accident. They're not hanging me for that -- they're hanging me for my beliefs.
I'd do away with the profit system and have production for use only. There's enough food and clothing and shelter for everybody if we'd use some sense.
Is that how you came to shoot the policeman?
There's nothing crazy about that, is there?
No, no, you're right. I don't want to kill anybody. All I want to do is be let alone.
Keep away!
It wasn't the Lord! It was the devil!
There's somethin' funny going on around here.
Ssh!
I'm a messenger at the State House. This is from the Governor.
How much do you make a week?
Who do you think!
A very fine-looking women.
We want to see you.
Wants Hildy -- and sounds very excited.
You're a dark horse, bowling googlies at your age. Toss me up another.
Yes, you was. Make him talk.
What's that?
The Germans are dropping men on bomb sites.
I don't mind.
Bloody.
Ask her yourself.
You do it. You're a girl.
We're not supposed to say, but we're being shipped out tomorrow.
Thanks. I hope you can come for the launching.
Except the servicemen.
And it was the last. Hasn't written a letter since. Not even a birthday card.
I wish you could have told me yourself.  Oh, Grace, it's not for long. They say it'll be over by Christmas.
How do we know they didn't plant it there? They know we're mad on jam.  They could poison half the country.
This phoney war get's on my nerves. If we're going to have a war, I wish they'd get it started.
That's why you never liked me. I'm different from you. Well, everything's different now, so it doesn't matter. So there.
There, there, my baby.
Or what?
You might still have a house.
Father, that's enough now
You know something, Molly? I like it on my own. I never got used to sharing a bed, not really.
Happy as can be. In the old groove.
Maybe, maybe, maybe... hey, you know what word I hate?
Who's your Daddy!
Couple more miles up this road.
Come on.
Almost there... are you in a hurry or something?
Yeah, come on.
That's not something to joke about.
Are you two gals all funny with each other?
What?
You shouldn't a done that.
Yeah, well we like to get fucked up and do fucked up shit, you know what I mean?
Actually it's G. Ober... Gerry Ober, but the guys drew in the other O, fucking assholes.
Great story Goober, how much?
The Duke?
But if you did.
Dude, talk about baggage, that ain't no carry-on shit, that's some heavy duty Samsonite shit.
Perfect.
Really fucking awesome.
I don't know.
What's that?
Cat fight, cat fight.
No problem.
I know, this is fucking nuts.
Alright, alright. I know... I wanted to be the photographer.
Let's get going before that thing tries to eat the car or something.
Don't worry, I'll be quick. Just stay here, no sense everybody getting drenched.
I gotta open the gate.
Drive through it!
Hmmmmmmmmm?
Aw, she was with some nosey, smartass high-rise kids. They were poking around... asking stupid questions.
Shit, this ain't worth nothing now that my name gotten all over it. I was a fixin' on trading it to Jackie Cobb.
Yeah, doesn't hurt himself, just spins it around next to his eyeball.
That seems likely.
Yeah, so how does that fit with the story of four morons with a flat tire looking for a dead tree?
Yeah?
I can't... I can't move my arms. I hurt so much.
I know, but we can make it out of here. We can do it.
Christ, I hope this isn't more crappy folk art. It's so quaint... it's so primal... it's so crap.
God damn it, I knew this witch-hunt was fucking bullshit.
What? I didn't hear anything.
Shhhhhh, quiet.
Yeah, it's really your fault that we're stuck in this shithole in the first place.
Just in the wrong place at the wrong time.
Huh?
Well, I thought I'd maybe take in a hoedown.
Oh, you mean on TV.
Aw, come on Jerry. We've gotten all we're gonna get out of this place and its starting to rain.
I think we should go straight. I mean we know for a fact there ain't nothing back that way, right?
Negative. Shit, we are so deep in the sticks we could walk for hours and find zero.
Well, even though I know it seems childish to you all. Tonight is Halloween eve and it special to us so you are all invited to stay for dinner.
Well, I... mmmmm... no, I ain't seen her, sorry.
No, I can't say that I ever seen 'em before...  ...he looks familiar, is he on TV?
Go down stairs and play nice... I'm a gonna go 'round back and handle things like I always fucking do.
Yes! I'm the one who beats you when you're bad...
Where we headed?
That is the wrong fork, young man.
Hey, ma. Did you bring any clothes? I'm freezing my ass off.
You decide. Today is your day.
Oui.  Now you've got me talking French.
Yes. Happy happy.
Thank you so much. Merci. It's very wonderful to hear a man say such a nice compliment.
The way you are taming him, it sends chills down my girlish spine and... everywhere else, too.
Urgh.
Hi. It's Nathan.
I've been seeing Johannsen in chemistry.
Just give me some time to let Lila down easily. She's a really nice girl and I don't want to hurt her more than is necessary.
That's Lila?
I don't know.
Oui.
I know. And that's great. But it would be great in a better way, not a better way but a different way, if I could find him and bring him back.
Very well.
Somehow it came up that you were a friend of mine. Mr. handsome, animal- loving psychologist said he would love to meet you.
Holy shit. Your brother didn't tell him about the nature of our relationship, did he?
Lila, it's Rosie.
Please, honey, let me in.
Heavens no. My work now is... Right now I'm teaching mice... well, table manners, to be candid.
Yes, and...
You really enjoy my company?
I like you, too, Nathan.
Fifteen.
If it's a person, why should we go see it? It's not like it's nature or anything. It's just a person.  Sometimes people who live in the woods don't want to be seen. They live in the woods because they're anti-social, Lila. We have to respect that.
Actually, I just had an amusing thought.
Feral, huh? Totally uncontaminated?
Look at him. He doesn't understand English. He moves like an animal.
Nathan, what the hell are you talking about?
Apes don't shave, you son of a bitch!
I'm glad you're female.  Do you think our boy witnessed the primal scene?
I guess.
Oh yes, baby! I think that this is a wonderful project you're doing, taking this poor unfortunate, uncivilized creature and turning him into a human being! What a wonderful wonderful compassionate man you are!
Should I come with?
Seemed fine. Quiet evening enjoying his new digs.
Yeah, well, I'm sorry. The human heart is a strange thing.
Lila...
Lila?
Extra dessert?
Look, why don't you and Lila stay here and have your natural life. I'll just go on my way. You'll never see me again.
Do you suppose it has anything to do with Lila's unusually hairy body?
Well, it seems that since Lila broached the subject of children, you've been on edge and I know you have an issue with the, uh, body hair.
Oh, I see. Yes, that's something to think about. That's very good. That's what you get the big bucks, right? Ha ha.
Yes.
Mm hmm.
Next game, ten bucks.
You want a chaser?
And a fact is a fact.
Well, nobody has to sell.
Listen, Miss Ladybird, you're here on a rain check and I know it. You're hanging on by your nails. You let that glory whistle blow loud and clear for Eddie and you're a wreck on a railroad track. You're a horse that finished last. So don't make trouble, Miss Ladybird. Live and let live. While you can.
What did he say?
I like it. It's good for you. Besides, you start drinking whisky gambling and it gives you an excuse for losing. That's something you don't need -- an excuse for losing. How did you make out in the poker game?
I got drunk.
So I stay. Stay until I hustle up enough to play Fats again. Maybe by that time I'll develop myself some character.
No, three thousand at least. He'll start you off at five hundred a game -- he'll beat the pants off you. That's the way he plays when he comes up against a man who knows the way the game is. He'll beat you flat four or five games -- maybe more, depending on how, uh... steady your nerves are. But he might -- he just might be a little scared of you, and that could change things. But I wouldn't count on it.
Thanks for the drink.
Oh yeah, I figured that. How much?
That's a -- that's a pretty big slice. Who do you think you are, General Motors?
You think I can lose?
You saw me beat Minnesota Fats for eighteen thousand dollars.
I don't know when it was.
Hi. How's business?
Sign up.
What's that supposed to mean?
Hey, whaddya say something like that for?
How much?
Level with me, Eddie. You ever play billiards before?
I got time, Bert.
You want me to tell her for you?
You gotta be hard, Eddie.
Want some free advice?
Comes right in this poolroom every night, eight o'clock on the nose. Just stay where you are. He'll find you.
Go ahead. Set 'em up the way they were before. Bet ya twenty bucks. Make that shot just the way I made it before.
I'll be alive when I get out, Charlie.
Fats, let's you and I shoot a game of pool for a thousand dollars a game.
Get with what?
You can't see it, can you, Charlie? I mean, you've never been able to see it. I came after him. And I'm gonna get him. I'm goin' with him all the way. The pool game is not over until Minnesota Fats says it's over. Is it over, Fats?
You don't need a drink.
Aah! I've got no stomach for that any more. I've had that kind of life.
That's right. When?
Oh yeah, yeah. You're tired.  And beat.
Yeah. You must come again.
Now, look, fella, I saw you playing at Ames the other night.
Ten dollars.
Heads.
I don't rattle, kid. But just for that I'm gonna beat you flat.
What?
Thanks. I will.
Thanks for the, uh, for the breakfast.
Can I buy you another drink?
You don't look like a college girl.
Eddie. The name is Eddie.
Eddie, where do you go when you go out?
When I'm sober. They get a little mixed up when I'm drunk. Most of the time they're mixed up.
Haven't you opened it?
Yeah. For a little while.
A loser?
Yeah. I met this guy -- Gordon, Bert Gordon. He said I was. Born loser.
I'm going to Kentucky. To Louisville. With a friend. Try to make some money. I need it, the money. I'll be leaving early in the morning.
Leave now.
Oh, grow up.
Why should I?
Well, that old lovin' horse paid twenty-two forty.  Let's see... two hundred I won from the jockey last night. And today at the track... I got five hundred and forty bucks.  Here, you hold it.
California? Is your name Felson? Eddie Felson?
Now I know why they call you Fast Eddie. Eddie, you talk my kind of talk...  Sausage! Rack 'em up!
You lived like this once.
You want to kill them.
If I'm a hunter it's because you taught me to be!
I don't know.
Before... when I was one of them. I would look at this and it was just strangers.  Now I... remember.
They are... sinister.  They want to kill me.
Besides, if we get a lot of work done this summer it'll be done.
You built things.
Was there anything over the hill?
Yes -- but ...
Where, Jimmy?
We'll be very careful.  But we have to see.  If something landed there, there would be a big scar in the ground. Wouldn't there?
The State Police.
Don't go over the hill, Mom. Please.
This afternoon.  It's wonderful up there -- you still haven't seen the best part.
Oh?
All right.  I'll be right back.
You're being paranoid.
Connie, don't hang up.
I wanted a career. Didn't you ever want to be part of something special?
If anything goes wrong I'll have to think quickly, adjust the signal, who knows?
He used to run the NASA. He knows where all the bones are buried. Comes in handy.
You're in meal penalty for disturbing my lunch.
That's the good news?
You don't move soon. I'll begin to decompose.
I'm only saying, it's been what? Four years, you still haven't signed your divorce papers.
You punched the President in the face?
We've gotta burn the rain forest, Pops. Dump toxic waste, pollute the air, rip up the ozone. Maybe if we screw this planet up enough they won't want it anymore.
Looks like they're preparing the invasion.
Then God help us.
And there are scattered reports of sightings over Miami, Ft. Worth, And Memphis.
We're down to approximately fifteen percent, Sir.  If you calculate the time it takes them to destroy a city and move on, we're looking at world wide destruction of every major city within the next thirty six hours.
That's not your call to make, Mr. Nimziki.
We're trying to communicate with them on all frequencies but we're getting nowhere. Atlantic Command is working on a type of visual communication.
Christ, why didn't you say anything about this when they first arrived? You could have warned us before we launched a counter attack that cost us hundreds of American pilots!
Baby, you know how it is. I have to report to El Toro right away.
Be careful.
Naw. I'll just tell my other girlfriends they can't come over tonight.
You know how I like to make a big entrance.
Sorry for what?
Dick-weed.
No. Exotic.
I thought you didn't recognize me.
Don't get premature on me, Jimmy. We don't light up 'til the Fat Lady sings.
I didn't even see them fire!
It's all fuzzy.
You're gonna break it. Just leave it alone. Here, take your medicine.
We're leaving.
If we don't strike soon, there may not be much of an America left to defend.
Two words, Mr. President. Plausible deniability.
I said call them back.
Many worlds...
Peace? No peace.
What is it?
I'll tell him we'll take two.
Dear me, the man is dense. This is a castle, isn't it? There are tapestries?
Well, like yourself, Doctor Jones, I have a passion for antiquities.  Have a look over here. This might interest you.
What good is it? This Grail Tablet speaks of deserts and mountains and canyons. Pretty vague. Where do you start looking? Maybe if the Tablet were intact, you'd have something to go on. But the entire top portion is missing.
Not "supposedly," Doctor Jones.
Didn't I warn you not to trust anybody, Doctor Jones?
Nazis?! -- Is that the limit of your vision?! The Nazis want to write themselves into the Grail legend and take on the world. Well, they're welcome. But I want the Grail itself. The cup that gives everlasting life. Hitler can have the world, but he can't take it with him. I'm going to be drinking my own health when he's gone the way of the Dodo.  The Grail is mine, and you're going to get it for me.
I knew it was you --
Tomorrow I'll steal you another.
Pretty sure.
You said go between them!
Mine, too.
Don't know. Think of something.
Junior!
I came here to save you.
Oh yeah? And who's gonna come to save you, Junior??
Oh, yes. But I found the clues that will safely take us through, in the Chronicles of St. Anselm.
Good.
Relax.
And do I detect a rebuke?
What you taught me was that I was less important to you than people who had been dead for five hundred years in another country. And I learned it so well that we've hardly spoken for twenty years.
What does that mean?
The penitent man is humble...
I can get it -- I can almost reach it, Dad.
Come on -- come on!
I don't need camels.
But, Indy --
Because you're looking for the Holy Grail.
No, Doctor Jones. It's yours!
Of course. Admittedly, it's taken time. Britain's controlled India for almost two hundred years now.
I remember first hearing your name when I was studying at Oxford. I am Chattar Lal, Prime Minister for His Highness the Maharajah of Pankot.
No? Well, I guess he just hasn't met the right woman...
Dr. Jones? The eminent archaeologist?
I am only his humble servant, but the Maharajah usually listens to my advice.
Well, I don't know... we came here from a small village and the peasants there told us that the Pankot Palace was growing powerful again -- because of some ancient evil.
Dr. Jones, in our country a guest does not usually insult his host.
I think that's enough of this nonsense, Dr. Jones...
Sure, I found him. Then last night I had a little trouble. Somebody tried to slit my throat.
That's it. Pankot Palace.
No.
Read you loud and clear, Indy!
That's what you've got these children -- these slaves digging for?
No. Now there is new Maharajah -- and palace is powerful again.
Somehow I feel safer in here.
Okay, I want you to lift your hand -- and pet the snake.
THE WHAT?!
Pet it on the head! Go on, pet it!
Well, when my nightclub career was run over by the Depression, some pinhead convinced me that "a girl could go places in the Orient..." So, look where I got.
I'd be safer sleeping with that snake.
You want me so bad, why don't you invite me?
I think you're too used to getting you own way, Willie...
Don't catch cold.
You know, Willie, I'll bet he's mad because they were eating his friends for dinner.
No... the heart's still beating!
You're gonna get killed chasing after your damn fortune and glory!
Figures...
They got no food to feed them. So they taking the elephants away to sell them.
I know you did!
It wasn't him.
Al.
Yes.
Then how'd I get here?
Of course you do!
Yeah JOE Why there's a little man in my head?
If I get you back to the lab, will you get out of my head?
He's not the problem. It's the van in the back.
I am. You are.
What do you mean we.
Think of the scientific data we'll gain. Come on, lets get out of here.
That's not a good idea.
Just scratched my arm, why?
The airport! Hey, wait a minute.
I'm at the airport.
Use my credit cards.
I can't do that.
Nothing, but it's yours. Change it. Change your whole persona.
The beach?
How else do you get seaweed under your nails?
Swim.
A girl.
How should I know?
No...you idiot!
Yeah. I did it.
What's nothing look like? ...it looks like nothing.
Not blue enough.
You want sophistication, it don't come cheap.
That place. By the window.
Who, me?
Just hold them close and stay still.
She's the toughest to read.
No. What will you do.
It wasn't like that.
On what?
Relax. Let me do this.
Too late.
A hard left. A hard left.
Neither can they.
No. You can't trust her.
I've got an idea.
While he makes the run.
He didn't. He left us that walkman chip to confuse us. Would have kept most people busy. We were too fast for him.
Aim what?
...Shit! It's just money.
Dieter!
Losing power. The laser drained it.
Where've you been?
Never mind that, where are we now.
We are in a dungeon. How do we get out?
About what?
You were the one who was always suspicious of her!
No. She just stayed with us. Like she did all along.
Works like a charm when I use it. You didn't say it right.
In my own way...I want you to know that...I love you.
Trouble...is, if we both get stuck here.
**?!! 
We met on the beach.
What about it?
Much better now, thank you. Just sit here quietly...see there's nothing to worry about...just be my old self again....soon...
Dinner...tonight.
...right here too.
Do what?
Hires you for what?
They kidded me a little.
He didn't.
This is a tough place to keep Kosher.
What's he done?
We're very close.
A chip. Goes in a computer.
How?
I asked him.
Sure I can, can't I?
Looks like they can. What did they do?
You can say that again. What do we do?
I knew it. I told him.
It keeps me busy. Everybody always wants something.
...Piece of mind.
Someone is selling. You followed us. If it's not him, it must be you. If it's not you, it must be him... You scared him off.
...Mr. Athol will be with you as soon as possible. Will you be able to wait?
Why?
You can't take that.
It is?
It will.
Poor bastard.
Whoever took it does.
Okay.
I heard them.
Push it.
What? Forget it.
Suein Hwang and Milo Geyelin.
Then what are you going to do?
If we could take a look, Mr. Wigand...
I'm told unusual promises were made to Wigand.
No, only that we would hold the story until it was safe for him...
And, I'm told there are questions as to our "star witness'" veracity.
Hey, listen, I hear you guys are sitting on something sensational over there.
Catch you later.
Okay.  Lowell?
You're sure you want to do this?
Did I tell you you were wrong?
No.  I'm assuming the cave-in begins with the threat of litigation from Big Tobacco. Are we talking... are we talking Brown & Williamson, here?
Try the car.
Right now?
Thomas Sandefur...
Yes.
It's Stuart... he's in Mexico City...
Will he go on-camera and talk about the Mexico City branch?
So, it's a big country with a free press. You can go work somewhere else.
Okay. Thank you.
You disappeared on me. How long you staying?
No, I usually sit around in my hotel room, dressed like this at 5:30 in the morning, sleepy look on my face.
I see a rhetorical question on the horizon.
Give me a break!
No, you give me a break! I never left a source hung out to dry, ever. Abandoned. Not 'til right fucking now! When I came on this job, I came with my word intact. I'm gonna leave with my word intact. Fuck the rules of the game! Hell, you're supposed to know me, Mike. What the hell did you expect? You expect me to lie down? Back off? What, get over it?
How have you liked your stay?
Good. I want to talk to you.
To straighten something out with you. Right here. Right now.
It happened after I talked to you. I do not like coincidences!
Okay, so, here you are... you go to work for tobacco.  You come from corporate cultures where research, really, creative thinking, these are core values. You go to tobacco... Tobacco is a sales culture. Market and sell enormous volume. Go to a lot of golf tournaments. The hell with everything else.  What are you doing? Why are you working for "tobacco" in the first place?
Good.  You have kids?
Oh, yes, yes, yes, I did... I wanted to talk to you. I wanted to hook up and talk to you. About what we were talking about in your car.
I drink. A couple of occasions more than I should have.  I was cited for shoplifting once. But it was a mistake...  I pushed Liane one time. We were both stressed out because of the pressure. She went to her mother's.  I got fired because when I get angry I have difficulty censoring myself. And I don't like to be pushed around!
I'm not pushing you around!  I'm asking you questions.
I believe that? Yes, I believe that.
You believe that because you get information out to people... something happens?
They do this with impunity!
I heard.
No.
Everything... you... say! And I can't defend you, man, with one hand tied behind my back! Because you keep from me... what they can discover. And they will discover everything! Believe me.
ABC Telemarketing Company.
A can opener! A $39.95 can opener. I canceled payment... It was junk.  You ever bounce a check, Lowell? You ever look at another woman's tits? You ever cheat a little on your taxes?  Whose life, if you look at it under a microscope, doesn't have any flaws...?
You try and have a good time.
He doesn't seem to be listening...
She's okay.
Now, they tried to get the Mississippi Court to honor it, but the judge threw it out...  However, for you, there is a more perilous effect to the Kentucky gag order...
...I believe Mr. Sandefur perjured himself because I watched those testimonies very carefully.
And that's what cigarettes are for...?
And you sent the document forward to Sandefur?
I sent the document forward to Sandefur. I was told that we would continue to work on a substitute, we weren't going to remove it as it would impact sales, and that that was his decision.
"The former executive has reason to bet on being sued, for major cigarette manufacturers..."
"There are times... I wish I hadn't done it. But there are times that I feel compelled to do it..." "I've -- if you asked me if I would do it again or if it's -- do I think it's worth it. Yeah. I think it's worth it."
I appreciate all that, Jeff. But, upon reflection... we've decided to expand our zone of comfort with you.
I told you we know each other, baby. Mr. Massey represented my ex-brother- in law. Martin Reiser?
I just want to make sure that you both --
-- and we are sure...
I'd just like to have a word with her.
Well -- I, uh, that is to say Mr. Dumbarton -- would like you to uh, neutralize a, uh, business associate by the name of Marylin Rexroth Doyle Massey uh Dumbart -- uh, Massey.
Here's her picture...
Oh Joe, be happy for us. I'll pay you the twenty thousand.
Uh... poetry recitation.
Not this one. Not unless her HMO covers plastic surgery, which, incidentally, she does not need.
Why would you need two time zones? You never leave Beverly Hills.
I already made my move, Kenneth.
Prior to your marriage, what was your profession?
Ruth Rabino.
You like kids.
I can't have a baby with a man I don't love... And I can't submit a child to divorce.
Maybe she wanted a free trip to LA. Maybe they offered her money. Massey is very seductive. Who knows.
Maybe they put a horse head in her bed?
Did you see the tape?
I told you. I was hungry.
You just haven't met the right person.
That is correct. Not to blow my own horn, but they devote an entire semester to it at Harvard Law.
Yes. He's a diamond in the rough. And I have a feeling that someday soon you'll be taking that diamond and leaving the rough.
Did you invite me here to score some cheap laughs.
You really think I engineered the whole thing. You think the marriage and the divorce was part of some scheme. You came here to celebrate because you think I'm without morality or soul. You --  sound like my mother.
Marylin? When did I say...?
She never particularly cared for me.
No. She loved me. She would never not love her son. She just didn't... I wasn't her "type." She said I was a very, colicky baby. You know? Difficult. Not a good sleeper? Didn't eat well? We got off to a bad start, and she never seemed to recoup --
No.
Huh?
Well, I suppose I could "girly" it up for you with a little Fortuny, and some passementerie --
Miles.
What do you want?
Are you threatening me, because I'm sure that's a violation of the terms of your bail.
You can't prove anything.
I don't have to. That's what the IRS guys do. And they do it with great zeal. See, they work at these tortuous civil service jobs, and when five hundred dollar an hour boys like you take their trade out in luxury goodies, these saps feel.. well, they feel like saps. And they feel bitter and they feel vengeful and they feel WRATH.  What is this? A Romeo and Julieta?
That's blackmail.
Marylin?
Miles? Miles! Where have you been? I've been trying to get in touch.
Just listen to me. I'm sorry, Miles. It's true that my initial intention was to...
I fell in love Miles.
I'm not leaving you. I took self defense
Look, Marylin, can't we have a civilized discussion about this?
Are you alright? You lost weight.
He's not what I expected. He's very -- he's so -- happy.
He would invite these girls home from the staple factory to our condominium in Palm Springs. He had a device he called the Intruder.
I'm sorry, Mr. Massey, but I felt certain you'd want to know -- Marylin Rexroth wants to see you.
She's here now.
A yert.  Ruth is a living legend, Rex. At a time when most women are in Boca, having early bird specials -- she's working so her husband can be in Montana. In a yert.
Oh, just a routine mammogram. She said to say hello. She's going to Positano with your brother's family.
That's delusional.
Yes. Maybe you're right, Miles. Maybe we're being too conservative. Seventy five percent.
Don't give me that crap. That's MY crap.
But then... But then...
That's the problem. I can't afford to give her anything.
Well -- is that possible?
We wanted Ruth here for your protection as well --
Mother?
You were never invited to meet your son-in-law?
I'm worried, Lovington. After all, something might have happened to her. 
Yes. I know. Still in the dumps, huh?
I'm afraid I'm a little confused. You see, I assumed you were coming here for
The average man would go after the reward. All you seem to
Yeahwith all the trimmings. Now, how about the check. Do I get it?
She grabbed herself a perfect running mate. King Westley! The pill of the century!  What she needs is a guy that'd take a sock at her every daywhether it's coming to her or not.
You can't tempt me.  Do you hear? I won't eat!
Please don't shout.
Who is he?
Well!
He's marvelous!
Well, under the circumstances, don't you think we ought to call this thing off?
Yessir. She refuses them all.
Sock her!
We've done that already.
Any others?
Yessir.  There's a report here from every State along the East coast. Want to hear them?
But it's King Westley on the phone.
Ooooooh.  Hello my would-be ex-son-in-law. I've sent you a check for a hundred thousand. Yes. That's the smartest thing you ever did, Westley, not to contest that annulment. That's satisfactory, isn't it? Yeah. Well, it ought to be. Oh I'm not complaining. It was dirt cheap.  Don't fall out of any windows.
There's another wire from Peter, sir. They're in Glen Falls, Michigan.
"Young people in love Are very seldom hungry. People in love Are very seldom hungry . . ."
Huh?
You win!
Yeah. I knew you'd catch on eventually.
Don't tell me your ticket was in it?
I don't want it reported!
Why, you ungrateful brat!
I hated to wake you up.  How about some breakfast?
Just a spoiled brat of a rich man. You and Westley'll make an ideal team.
Never mind. You know I had you pegged right from the start, you're the spoiled brat of a rich father. The only way you can get anything is to buy it. Now you're in a jam and all you can think of is your money. It never fails, does it? Ever hear of the word "Humility"? No, you wouldn't. I guess it never occurred to you to just say, "Please mister, I'm in trouble. Will you help me?" No; that'd bring you down off your high horse for a minute. Let me tell you something; maybe it'd take a load off your mind. You don't have to worry about me. I'm not interested in your money or your problems. You, King Westley, your father, you're all a lot of hooey to me.
Oh, you did? What am I expected to doleap for joy?
Well, thank you. Thank you very much, but you've been very kind. 
Oh, this?I like privacy when I retire. I'm very delicate in that respect. Prying eyes annoy me.  Behold the walls of Jericho![4] Maybe not as thick as the ones that Joshua blew down with his trumpet, but a lot safer. You see, I have no trumpet.  Now just to show you my heart's in the right place, I'll give you my best pair of pajamas.
Yeah. I got a name. Peter Warne.
I met some very interesting women at the showers. We got to chatting about this and that. You know how time files.
Hurry up and get dressed.
He apologized for last night.  Said he didn't know we were married.
It's a wonder I'm not panic stricken.
It has its moments. It got to be a sort of game to try to outwit father's detectives. II did it once; actually went shopping without a body-guard. It was swell. I felt absolutely immoral. But it didn't last long. They caught up with me in a department store. I was so mad I ran out the back way and jumped into the first car I saw. Guess who was in it?
Um-hm. We rode around all afternoon. Father was frantic. By 6 o'clock he was having all the rivers dragged. 
Don't look at me. I didn't marry King Westley.
Well, you don't have to lose your temper!
He didn't make a pass at me! I told you a million times!
I don't trust that chatterbox.
You didn't give that boy all your money?
Must be some strange power Westley has over you women.  How do you expect to get there?
To New York?
Here. Eat your head off.
Nothing.  Nothing you'd give two cents for.
No!!  It's a wonder you couldn't get me something I can eat.
I hate the horrid stuff.
You're an expert, I suppose.
You think it's simple, huh?
Oh, that's nothing. Now take number three, for instance. That's a pip. It's the pathetic one. When you're brokeand hungryand everything looks black. It's a long movement like this  with a follow through.
Now watch me. I'm going to use Number One. Keep your eye on that thumb, baby, and see what happens.
What happened?
I'm glad you think so. If you ask me, it's foolish. I told you there's no sense in our staying here tonight. We could make New York in less than three hours.
Why don't you stay and watch the fun? You'll enjoy it immensely.
I would. But I've got a weak stomach.
You can't be hungry and scared at the same time.
Sorry, Miss.
When does the bus leave?
Thank you.
No, he ain't! And the car's gone, too.
Serves you right. Oughta be careful who you take up with on the road. You can't go plyin' your trade in my camp.
But can't you wait until morning
Thanks.
Throw it in the basket.  What's it say?  "Have I got a story! It's getting hotter and hotter. Hope you're the same."
Yes.
Don't "Joe" me.
Okay, Joe. Listenyou know I've always liked you. Anytime I could do you a great turnanytime I ran into a story that looked goodI always came running to you, didn't I? Well, I got one now. Those wires I sent you were on the level. It's the biggest scoop of the year. I'm giving it to you, Joe.
Never mind . . . Listensuppose I should tell you that Ellen Andrews is going to have her marriage annulled.
That she's going to marry somebody else.
Would an exclusive story like that be worth a thousand bucks to you?
Say, Buddy
A gat! A gat!  Got any fireworks on you?
You love them, don't you?
Al, you can't tell a mink from a coonskin unless you see the fur up close.  Goddamn, Sam!  If we don't start reading between the lines here! Y'all gotta start thinking on a different level - like the CIA does. We're through the looking glass. Here white is black and black is white.
The interesting thing is the extent to which the Warren Commission went to make him a Communist.  They got almost 150 pages and 130 exhibits of the report on this Mexico trip and the picture doesn't even match.  I'm beginning to think the point of the Mexican episode was to lay the blame at Castro's door.  If Oswald, or someone purporting to be Oswald, had gotten into Cuba, come back, then killed the President, the American public once again would've screamed for a Cuban invasion...
My instinct is that Ferrie is going to keep on deteriorating, and we'll end up getting more out of him when he finally cracks.  If we call him now, he might freeze up and we could lose the best shot we've ever had.
You tell them the day after the assassination you were called on the phone by this "Clay Bertrand" and asked to fly to Dallas and be Lee Oswald's layer.
You can't ever say crime don't pay in Louisiana, Jim - only not as good as it used to.  Good chowder, ain't it?
Did you speak to Oswald in Dallas?
I think I'll cut out here, chief.  I gotta get home.
Yeah, I guess you do.
Senator Long set your boss up, my friend.
When something's rotten in the land, Bill, it generally isn't just one fish, we'll get corroboration... find this Clay Bertrand.  If I were a betting man, I'd give you 10 to 1 it's an alias.  Start checking around the Quarter.
And the six of us, with almost no budget and in secret, are going to solve the case that the Warren Commission with dozens of support staff and millions of dollars couldn't solve.  We can't keep up with the crimes in the Parish as it is, Chief.
There's a word - orders.
I don't doubt their involvement, Bill, but at a low level.  Could the Mob change the parade route, Bill, or eliminate the protection for the President?  Could the Mob send Oswald to Russia and get him back?  Could the Mob get the FBI, the CIA, and the Dallas Police to make a mess of the investigation?  Could the Mob appoint the Warren Commission to cover it up?  Could the Mob wreck the autopsy?  Could the Mob influence the national media to go to sleep? And since when has the Mob used anything but .38's for hits, up close? The Mob wouldn't have the guts or the power for something of this magnitude.  Assassins need payrolls, orders, times, schedules.  This was a military-style ambush from start to finish... a coup d'etat with Lyndon Johnson waiting in the wings.
Boss, are you calling the President a murderer?
He'd die pretty quick, either a heart storm or a ruptured blood vessel in the brain.
...and have you ever met David Ferrie?
It leads farther than that.
Photographs - compromising stuff. And he'll use 'em.  The Agency plays for keeps...  I knew Oswald.  He was in my Civil Air Patrol unit.  I taught him everything.  A "wanna be," y'know, nobody really liked him cause he was a snitch.  I treated him good.  He'd talk about his kid, y'know, really wanted her to grow up with a chance, but... He got a raw deal.  The Agency fucked him.  Just like they're gonna fuck me.
You think I was a getaway pilot for the assassination, don't you?
Dave, can I just ask you this directly?  Did you ever work for the CIA?
But you were a qualified pathologist. Was this Army general a qualified pathologist?
No, you don't!
The truth is that I heard between four and six shots.  I'm not going to lie for you.
We have that taken care of.  You only heard three shots and you are not to talk to anyone about this. No one, you hear?
Makes sense - he's a spokesman.
None!  The State Department issues him a new passport in 48 hours and loans him the money to travel.  He's never investigated or charged by the Navy for revealing classified information or, as far as we know, debriefed by the CIA.
This is a man whose secrets cause us to change our radar patterns in the Pacific!  He should've been prosecuted as a traitor!
But who meets him when he gets off the boat in New York in June '62?
We recently talked to a number of men who claim to know you.  Are you acquainted with a David Logan?
No.  I'm sure I've never met anyone of such a bizarre appearance.
Please answer the question.
Nonsense.  What next?
Mr. Garrison, you're reaching.  I am an international businessman.  The Trade Mart which I founded is America's commercial pipeline to Latin America.  I trade everywhere. I am accused, as are all businessmen, of all things.  I somehow go about my business, make money, help society the best I can and try to promote free trade in this world.
Well maybe you're right, Jim.  I'll give you one hour to solve the case... until the kids are in bed.  Then you're mine and Mr. Kennedy can wait 'til morning.  Come on, everybody say goodnight to Daddy.
Honey, in all my years in the service I never knew a single man who was given a Russian test.  Oswald was a radar operator.  He'd have about as much use for Russian as a cat has for pajamas.
Liz, I'm really sorry.  The meeting went much longer than expected.
It's not funny, Jim, I'm scared.
Get a hold of yourself.
I remember he had some kinda thing wrong with his left leg.  He limped. Don't get me wrong, he's not one of those, you know, limp wrists.  He's a butch John.  You'd meet him on the street, you'd never snap.  You could go fishing with him, play poker with him, you'd never snap in a million years.  So one night we were over at Ferrie's place.  Having a party. Sometime in the late summer of '63.
No word yet.  But they think it's in the head.
Let's get outta here, Lou.  I saw too much stuff like this in the war.
Lou, you were in the Marines.  Who would be running that training?
What are you driving at, boss?
You know who the mayor was?
Allen Dulles?
I will not have any damned ultimatums put to me, Lou.  I'll accept your resignation.
I sometimes feel things've gone downhill since John Kennedy was killed, Senator.
Honey, another one of these.  This one's as weak as cricket pee-pee. Yessir, you mark my words, Jim, Vietnam's gonna cost Johnson '68 and it's gonna put that other varmint Nixon in - then watch your hide, 'cause there ain't no offramps on a freeway to Hell!
That's exactly my question, Jerry. Maybe I'd better show you some pictures so you can begin to understand what I am talking about.
Just speculating, I guess.  How do you think it started?
...don't think so.  When they start to drool, they get rid of 'em.  These guys are proud of what they did. They did Dealey Plaza!  They took out the President of the United States!  That's entertainment!  And they served their country doing it.
Just think... just think.  What happened to our country .. to the world...  because of that murder... Vietnam, racial conflict, breakdown of law, drugs, thought control, guilt, assassinations, secret government fear of the frontier...
I keep thinking of that day, Tuesday the 26th, the day after they buried Kennedy, L.B.J. was signing the memorandum on Vietnam with Ambassador Lodge.
I expected that two months ago, and they're wasting their time... The bad news is the National Guard has just asked me to resign after 18 years.  Well, maybe that's good news - it was never as good as combat, but this is.  Bill, any more on Oswald and Shaw?
You were lucky.  I spent three years in the Pacific.  I've never seen an avenue with such a profusion of bail-bonding companies. Why is that?
That's all you've had all this time?
Stop your investigation... it was a magnificent effort but it's over and done with.  The press is already on your behind and that's only the beginning, my boy, only the beginning.
Do you walk home?
Mr. Ruby, I really can't see why you can't tell us now.
What are they?
Are you kidding, it looks great. You wear this to a business meeting, you're the badass in the room. But you can go out dancing in this too. It's a total power suit.
I went. I did. I took my mother and little brother.
I'll call her.
You.
Naw, man. They just tryin' to put a fright in your ass.
I went to give him his refund, so he wouldn't have to come here.
What's she want?
This is Special Agent Ray Nicolet with Alcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms. Would you mind if we looked in that bag?
If I were to tell you "no it isn't..."
I'm tellin' you, I don't know nothin' about that fuckin' shit.
Thanks.
I'd love one, but not there.
That doesn't sound dark.
Why does it need to be dark?
She was more helpful than the fuckin' Public Defender.  I don't know -- I guess what I need is a lawyer, find out what my options are.
You mentioned a guy from L.A.P.D., but you didn't mention the Federal.
I didn't?
Ray Nicolet with Alcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms.
You went out this morning and bought a gun?
Who is this?
It's different with men.
Yeah.
How was it?
Yea, but I'm going to dress it up. Put the money in a shopping bag and hand it to someone I meet here.
Make the delivery somewhere in the mall.
I don't follow your logic. What does his being nice to you have to do with him wanting Ordell's money?
You know some interesting people.
No, I mean you, right now. Not it you were somebody else.
You know where it came from. It's not like it's anybody's life savings. It wouldn't even be missed.
The day you got me out of jail?
Do you think they bought it?
Oh, yeah. I got them thinking Ordell's real nervous. They love thinking he's scared of them.
Yeah, your fee. I had to figure that out, since there wasn't no note.
You know what's in the bag you're taking?
He say is a surprise.
I need it tomorrow. If I don't show up for work tomorrow, I'm fired.
He told me. Besides, why else would an A.T.F. man be after him?
What are you doing?
Not really.
What's her story?
You didn't count it?
I have no evidence of your taking anything. You didn't pay for your snazzy new suit with marked bills; I was glad to see that. You've been helping us out, you gave us Melanie and Louis. Melanie had a packet of marked bills stuffed in her shorts when they found her, which goes a long way backing up your story.
I'm waiting for the phone.
Gimme one anyway.
Are you getting that black suit?
Yeah.
The cops didn't try and strangle my ass.
Go sit over in that chair.
All your money's in Mexico.
It's right on Hawthorne Boulevard and Manhattan Beach Boulevard. It's red brick...
Oh, wait, you mean that place that has the big sign with a rooster on it?
You don't have to. I told 'em you're real careful. You never pick up money yourself. You always send someone, and I never know who it is.
And they follow the wrong one thinkin' she's bringing it to me.
I'll give ya ten.
What'd you care?
She don't know shit about the money.
She waits for you to go in the place where you try things on.
I'm gonna be sittin' at the titty bar In downtown L.A. till my man over here calls me and gives me the O.K. sign.
Ray, the A.T.F. guy.
If I wasn't, this wouldn't work. Now once I deliver I'll have to trust you.
I'm impressed. He knows a lot.
Susanville.
Really, I'm impressed.
It's a diet thing?
No, it's what body builders drink to beef up.
The roller disco one.
I thought you were sixteen.
With Ordell?
So what are you trying to tell me? I should get out of here?
No.
You live with him.
Uh-huh?
Yeah, down the end.
Okay.
I dunno.
He put himself in a situation where he was gonna have to do ten years in the penetentiary, that's what he did.  And if you know Beaumont, you know there ain't no way in hell he can do no ten years. And if you know that, you know Beaumont's gonna go any goddam thing Beaumont can to keep from doin' those ten years including telling the Federal government everything they want to know about my ass. Now that, my friend, is a clear case of him or me. And you best believe it ain't gonna be me. You know what I'm sayin'? You gonna come in on this with me, you gotta be prepared to go all the way. I got me so far over a half-a-million dollars sittin' in lockboxes in a bank in Cabo San Lucas. Me and Mr. Walker make us one more delivery, I'm gonna have me over a million. You think I'm gonna let this little cheese eatin' nigga here fuck that up? Shit, you better think again. 'Fore I let this deal get fucked up, I'll shoot that nigga in the head, and ten niggas look just like em.  Understand what I'm sayin'?
She one of the women I got set up. I got Melanie in Hermosa Beach. I rent Simone a small house in Compton, and about four blocks away I got me this nineteen-year-old country girl named Sheronda. I found her waitin' for a bus two days outta Alabama, barefoot, country as a chicken coop. Took her to my house in Compton, told her it was Hollywood.
Yep.
Well, why the fuck keep her around?
When I see you. Pick me up at Sam's. You count the money?
I haven't even looked at it yet, it's still in the shopping bag.
How long was she in there?
Maybe a minute. She came right out.
If she's got it, why didn't she take it all?
They don't have your winning personality.
Cost you a thousand for the bond.
Beaumont. That's the only name I know.
Man, he won't like that. Beaumont don't got a doin' time disposition.
Now I need you to count your money.
The bond for possession is only a thousand.
What?
Somebody with a grudge blew Beaumont's brains out -- hey, that rhymes -- blew Beaumont's brains out.
Who says she does anything for me? She's my friend. When my friends get into trouble, I like to help 'em out.
I'm telling you what I have to do. What you have to do, in case you forgot, is come up with premium of a thousand bucks.
I got it. I just don't got it on me.
Man, you know I'm good for it. Thousand bucks ain't shit.
Man, you need to look at this with a little compassion. Jackie ain't no criminal. She ain't used to this kinda treatment. I mean, gangsters don't give a fuck -- but for the average citizen, coupla nights in County fuck with your mind.
Falsely accused of Intent. If she had that shit -- and mind you, I said "if" -- it was just her shit to get high with.
Is that what I think it is?
Mister Robbie, isn't it? I have the ten thousand you put up. Isn't that why you called.
She got off, huh?
How the fuck did he find me?
You get used to it after a while. Now tell me where my money's at.
She wanted to see me, why wasn't she home?
She was afraid.
Uh-huh.
No.
We been shoppin'. Can't have my boy running around lookin' like a bum on the street.
He's around.
What are you then?
You want to see me? Well, here I am.
Do you want some help? I can call upstairs.
No, don't. But thanks.
What do you want from me?
That's right. We did.
There's nothing to expose.
Maybe it's not the army, Jake.
I'm hanging up.
There was a bang.
Don't go?  I'm not going anywhere. I'm right here, Gabe.  Come on, go back to sleep. You can still get a couple of hours.
I don't have to do any such thing. I'm eating my lunch, okay?
Turn on your right side.  How about the other "right?"  I don't understand you philosphers. You've got the whole world figured out but you can't remember the difference between right and left.
I was absent the day they taught that in school. What did she say?
Right. She doesn't stop talking about you. You're always on her mind. That's love, Jake.
Her problem is that you spent eight years getting a PhD and then went to work for the post office.
I had to get in there. A deep adjustment. Rest a moment and let it set a bit.
I don't know. I've been having them recently.  You know, you look like an angel, Louis, an overgrown cherub. Anyone ever tell you that?
I know.
Not tonight, Louis. No more rest.
Last I heard you were offered a posi- tion in the West somewhere. Tuscon was it?
I see them, Prof. Everywhere. They're invading my life.
Carlson? Is he new here?
That's ridiculous. I've been coming here for years. Listen to me. I'm going out of my fucking mind here. I need to see him.
Of course not. You have all the blankets. It must be ten degrees in here. I'm telling you, Sarah, if you want to sleep with fresh air, you sleep on the fire escape. From now on that window is closed.
I don't want to know.
She was good in bed, though.
No. Of course you're not. You've just hurt your back. That's all. You're going to be fine. It'll just take some time.
I don't know. Santa Claus. I had my son's picture in it. Gabe's picture. It's the only one I had.
The room!
Who? Jed?
I don't let anybody call me that.
And look what I got.
Pictures. Your wife was gonna toss 'em so "what's his name" brought 'em over on his way to school.
Well, you didn't marry her.
How's it going?
Am I home?
Baby, I'm sorry. I feel terrible. I'd stay and talk but I'm so late. Look, don't be upset. We'll talk when I get home. See you around midnight.  Bye. And don't brood. Watch T.V. or something.
Stay away from me, Jez.
How do you know he's telling the truth?
I tell you, it was so wonderful. I felt like a little boy. I saw Paradise, Jezzie.
It's so hard to believe.
I can waitress. I'm good.
I love you when you're angry.
No! What's going on? Where's my family?
With wings.  You transport me, you know that? You carry me away.
Hold me, Jezzie. Hold me.
I don't know you.
Goddamn it. Why do you say that?
You can have anything you want.
Where's West? New Jersey?
Don't play games with me. There's nothing more to say.
Wake up! Stop playing with yourself. It's finished.
Your capacity for self-delusion is remarkable, Dr. Singer.
A couple days later they decided to use the Ladder, on one test battalion. Yours. Just in an infintessimal dose in the food supply, to prove its effectiveness in the field. They were sure your unit would have the highest kill ratio in the whole goddamn offensive. And you did, too. But not the way they tnought.
So why tell me now?
For what? For seeking the truth?
Speaking.
I need to see you, Jake.
No joke. Fuckin' army! That goddamn war. I'm still fightin' it.
Why the hell we drivin' here?
How did it happen?
Bring it in.
Alright, asshole.
What if we blow the walkways first? Leave Jason over here to go up with the ship?
Rizzo did.
He came for me, I had to run!
Cool.
I think I broke my arm.
Faster! Don't we have another gun?
I am an expert!
You're a teacher.
Fine, just stay out of my way.  Hit it.
At least try to get him alive...will ya Brodski?
Fuckin A...
No you don't!
Not so bad.
No thank you, you crazy old woman.
Oh I like her a lot.
Kay-Em, you've saved our lives, you know that don't you?
Remember to roll his balls around a bit.
Would you?
Teleportation? Some way to beam us the hell out of dodge?
I'm just saying.
You need to get laid!
Are there any other shuttles?
Oh, hush. I disengaged your pain programming.
Who are you apologizing to?
Oh, alright.
I missed you too.
I just know.
Then open the doors!
I didn't say he was alive.
Exactly.
Dad, the ponds are for old ladies.
Sure, Dad.
Here --  Take him home.
And incidental damages, if any...
Older, sillier.
It's his birthday present, and you closed the beach, Honey. I told him not to go in the water after what happened yesterday. I don't believe he'll ever do it again.
Do I need any more authority?
I was only reacting to what I was told.
No, it was local jurisdiction.
Be careful, for chrissake.
There's no limits to where he can strike, and we've had three attacks and two deaths in the past few days. It happened like this before, in 1916, when a Great White killed five swimmers at Jones Beach, in Long Island.
I wish it would rain...
You were on the Indianapolis? In '45? Jesus...
And nobody else saw her in the water?
It's only two-thirty. What, are you tired?
Twenty years.
Better than Cousteau, or Compagno with computers, telemetry, Defense Department funding...
C'mon, it'll give us time to think about what they're going to say.
-- and an America's Cup Trials...
I'm not talking about day sailing or pleasure boating. I'm talking about working for a living. Sharking.
At least you handle the boat all right. Stop. Here... Cut the engine.
Nothing! A pleasure scar. Look here --
No way! He can't!
I'm not hungry, oddly.
Go Carole.  So, guess what?
Yeah, typically. That's what happens when our moms and teachers get pregnant.
Sorry, Bleek... Going for my ultrasound. Gotta note and everything.
Okay, cool.
I'll try to drop by later.
Not this time. You don't have any reason to be mad at me. You broke my heart. I should be royally ticked at you, man. I should be really cheesed off. I shouldn't want to talk to you anymore.
Forget it, Bleek. Take Katrina the Douche Packer to the prom. I'm sure you guys will have a really bitchin' time!
Oh my God, SHUT UP!
Well at least you don't have to walk around with the evidence under your sweater. I'm a planet!
You shouldn't be carrying that heavy bag. I'll take it.
Oh. It's fine. What's another ten pounds?
Why?
No, you're naturally smart. You always think of the funniest things to do. Remember when you passed me that postcard during Spanish class, and it was addressed like, "Junebug MacGuff, Row 4, Third Seat From the Blackboard"? And it said, "I'm having fun in Barcelona -- wish you were here"? That was hilarious.
Plus, you're the only person who doesn't stare at my stomach all the fucking time. You actually look at my face. And every time I look at you, the baby starts kicking me super hard.
You think you're special because you get to play Picture Pages up there?
I'm not ready to be a Pop-Pop.
Oh God yeah. But I was hoping she was expelled or into hard drugs.
That was my first instinct too. Or D.W.I. Anything but this. And I'm going to punch that Bleeker kid in the weiner the next time I see him.
You could have sent it to them. Why would you drive an hour out to East Jesus, Nowhere?
It's called a spinal block, and you can't have it yet, honey. The doctor said you're not dilated enough.
You know, you've been acting like this ever since I went up to see my brother at Mankato. I told you, nothing happened!
Yes they are, Josh. Since Mankato, they have been lying eyes.
Good, I'll be sure to do that, Amanda. I'll make a note of it.
I mostly work from home. I'm a composer.
Commercials.
We definitely want it to have junk.
Hey, I like this.
Nothing. She just hates when I sit around watching movies and 'not contributing.'
Why?
Okay, stop surfing porn and get back to work. Just wanted to say hi.
I don't know. I just liked being your friend. I sort of liked becoming furniture in your weird life.
Well, it was nice seeing you.
Just, you know, shopping with my girlfriends.
Elbow.
My dad used to be in the Army, but now he's just your average HVAC specialist. He and my mom got divorced when I was five. She lives on a Havasu reservation in Arizona...
No, no, I'm definitely not asking for anything. Except maybe mercy. Like, it would be really great if nobody hit me.
Paulie Bleeker? I didn't know he had it in him!
Please stop now.
Dad, it's not about that. I just need to know that it's possible for two people to stay happy together forever. Or at least for a few years.
I drank like ten tons of Sunny Delight. Anyway, yeah. I'm pregnant. And you're shockingly cavalier.
Keep your voice down dude, my mom's around here somewhere. She doesn't know we're sexually active.
I was thinking a graphic designer, mid-thirties, and his cool Asian wife who dresses awesome and plays bass. But I'm trying to not be too particular.
I just thought she'd look really old in real life.
Eww, he's all beardy!
He asked her. I heard they were going to Benihana, then the prom, then to Vijay's parents' cabin.
Yeah, well, Bleek trusted me. We're best friends.
Are you looking for any other compensation?
Of course we're ready. We've taken all the classes. The nursery. The books --
I know we're prepared. I just don't know if... I'm ready.
I suppose anything's possible.
I haven't... I'm a fast learner.
Could I try that?
No it is not!
What'll we do out there?
Early, sing me a song.
Brian.
Who?
You wanna hear mine?
Ain't you goin' to record it?
Nah... how much money have you got?
They picked up hitchhikers... young men... and brought them back here.
What happened to Adele?
...just like that?
What are you going to do?
You mean 'Ted Bundy's' finally agreed to leave?
Where's Adele?
No, never. Excuse me.
He wasn't going to shoot her, you murdering son of a bitch!
Yeah.
How?
And she goes, yeah that picture was taken less than a year ago. I look younger without my makeup.
I mean I'm dreaming about going all out, crazy shit.
She's probably smash you in the fucking face.
Hell yeah. Fuckin' starvin'. Wait up a sec.
Yeah.
Three pennies and a ball of lint.
Unzip my pack, yo.
No, I'm serious man. I'm dead ass. Do you wanna try? We could be like the fuckin X-rated "Wonder Twins"!
Who?
Yeah. She's so little, so pretty, and innocent.
What are you talking about?
Yeah.
Naw. But we should run by the park and get a dime. Maybe Darcy will be at the park.
Casper, where's Telly.
Yo, we might have killed him. You think?
Hell ya. We broke that mothafucka.
What?
Hold on.
Yeah. After I saw you last week.
She won't? Why not?
Yeah. I can understand that.
Tonight?
Come on. You can rave on another night.
How do you know?
Oh man. You gotta see this. It's a spectacle. A real spectacle.
I don't feel so well. Have you seen Telly anywhere?
No.
Yeah, I guess so.
Are you in trouble with the law?
Yeah?
Oh yeah, sure. When I was a kid I had a crush on the prom queen. Darlene Louis. She had a big black mole in the center of her face that used to get me so excited. Darlene Louis. You know you look a little bit like her.
Of course. How am I gonna forgive him after what he did?!
Did you bleed?
Mine are like my neck and my chest.
And it's like. How much more can I bob here? You know.
That's it. I'm gonna have to tell my little brother, I'm gonna die. I can't make him his lunches anymore.
Do you know where he went?
Yeah. She should be at Nasa tonight. Why you lookin for him? You like him now or sometin'?
Whah?
Yeah I get bored.
Yeah.
Four-thirty in the morning?
Hello?
I think you're lying.  That's what kind of problem.
I used to.  With my old man.  He taught me how to hunt and trap.  Trapping's a lot harder than most people think.  We used to go after Raccoons mostly. They'd get into our garbage, our fields.  When an animal can't live peacefully with those around it, it has to be destroyed.  But they're crafty little devils.  You see the trick is, you can put your trap down, but no Raccoon is going come near it unless you lay down the scent.  You ever smell Raccoon scent?  Smells like shit, but to a male Raccoon it smells just like pussy.  He'll walk right up to that trap, even though it don't look nothing like a Raccoon and stick his Goddam head right in it.  You know why?  Cause he can't help himself.  The scent drives him.  So, if you want to catch a Raccoon all you gotta do is figure out where he is -- lay down the scent -- and sooner or later he'll walk right into the trap.
Sit down!
No.  She just moved here last month from Portland.
I'm sorry, this is just too convenient.
Could someone this disturbed give the appearance of being normal?
You weren't mad at him for picking up the phone?
Jesus, you're sleeping with the guy. You've lost your perspective.  You can't possibly be unbiased.
You couldn't find your dick in a wind storm!
Who is this?
Yes.  Why did you kill Debi Rutlege?
So is mine, within the framework of my rules.
If it's so important, why don't you just tell me?
I couldn't tell you that.  It would ruin the game.  Not that you're playing it very well.
Let me speak to my daughter.
Oh, I put a few games on for your daughter.  I hope you don't mind.
No problem.  We're in.
Set up some pieces on the big board?
1985.  Hans Korshaud.
Yeah -- that's what we've always thought -- but what if he wasn't?  What if I had nothing to do with the reason he came here?
You're losing me.
I see.  You forgot to bring you're night-light, didn't you?
That has nothing to do with it.
For what?
Not much.  There's no sign of a break in.  I think she let him in.
No Frank.  No prints.
That means she was dead before we even finished figuring out the message.
Well, the fact that he views this as a game suggests that he is trying to prove some sense of superiority -- and the way he murders confirms a need to be in complete control of his victim.
I know that.  I've seen the photo's.
What are you saying?  That I'm seeing what I want to see?  That I'm protecting a murderer?  What?
What does that mean?
No.  He was wearing a mask... but I saw the cut on his wrist.  It was Peter.
She called to give me my schedule for tomorrow.
I don't know.  I was afraid there'd be hours of questions.  I can't afford to miss a game.
Maybe, but I don't think so.  I think it's just a tease.
Look, I'll do anything you want!  I'll sign anything you want!  Just send a car out to the hotel.
I suppose you have something in mind?
No.  I don't.
Do you always open quickly?
She could be dead after the game.
This isn't a game.
Of course.
How the hell can I relax after seeing what I just saw.
I know it was bad.
I'm sure you are.
You always want to talk about me.  What about you?
If I have to.  I'm going to take a shower.
--admit what?  That I was right about you in the steam room?  That you're willing to do anything to find out what you want?  Would you like me to leave so you can search the rest of the room?
Where's the note?
No, listen.  You have no idea of the kind of pressure I'm under right now.
Of course it isn't.  It's always difficult when someone you love dies. But you can't feel responsible because she had a car accident.
But I do.
No, I want you to do good.  That way when I beat you at the end I'll look that much better.
You're getting sloppy, Yurilivich. You're nervous?
I have no intention of getting used to it.
Thank you, but I can wait.
About what?
I can't wait either.
Colwyn.
Come quickly, Colwyn. I can see the eyes of the Beast.
You can't reach her!  Through the door.  Quickly!
You will not follow the Slayers, you will obey my command!  You have no chance alone, boy. You must try to break through to Ynyr. He has great knowledge. Only with his help can you save Lyssa.
I have no extraordinary powers.
Your powers are greater than you know.  Have you ever seen one of these?
There is no other way.
But there is another entrance to this place.
I am too old to climb down a rope.
<u>Why</u>?
Can she be forced?
Never.
Cut. <u>Cut</u>!
Staying alive.
Because you would not rob if you had no children to provide for.
Naturally.
I intend to keep you alive, your majesty. So you can abdicate your throne and become my Warlord.
A <u>boar</u>? Those incompetent louts couldn't catch a piglet, much less a boar.
Tonight and every night, my friend, for this is the second time you've saved my life.  I am Ergo the Magnificent, short in stature, tall in power, etcetera, etcetera.
And what do you think a small person lives in, you one-eyed fool? Leaving me here to mope while you and the boy were arranging my assassination.
Sugarballs?
Smart lad.  Bring me my spices!
Your boast is a bigger mouthful than your roast, Magnificence.
Look at its insides.
It is important to assure the succession.
I knew.
That I am, my lady.
He leads a group of Slayers, under the leopard banner.
Such a vision will be opposed. Who seeks it?
The new King.
I was beautiful then.
Then the other Lyssa will share your fate. She will grow old in the Fortress as you have grown old here.
Huh? I see, but this is the FBI, little girl, and I can't let you in.  But if you leave me his money, I'll give him it myself.
OK. Mister Stansfield, Norman STANSFIELD.
No?
Well... Did you sleep with him or not?
...This is what I don't like, you see: you don't refrain me, but at the same time I can't get out!
Why?
There are better things.  You see the importance of the "moment".  Ten minutes early or late, he'd have seen death. He'd have suffered it.  This way, he already departed. Without knowing.
...Later.
Well... 1... 2... 10... 100... 1000? How many, approximately?
Maybe it's the time to do something, isn't it?
It will take them five minutes!  How long ago did they arrive?
Good morning, Mister... It's Danielle!
...One second.
...No... he's my lover...
Because you have to pay.  It's like a parking meter: if you stay, you pay. It's the rule...
Huh... Yeah, yeah... Of course.
Yeah, but I don't give a shit about.  I trade at left, at right and that's dangerous in there...
No... Dino's.
For a walk.  I don't know.
Adelle... Maurice is in the paper.
I have to walk -- by myself -- all the way -- every inch.
No it's not.
If you can't redo these six hundred miles when you're rested and ready, how are you possible going to walk another two thousand-five hundred miles in your present condition?
What?
I won't let you die.
I think my uncle is suffering from a condition called Mania which is linked with depression.  It is a time when an individual will act over-confident, and will act out impractical, grandiose plans. Sometimes these plans can be dangerous.
A couple days to a few months if untreated.
It's hard to say.  It's a delicate surgery.  There's no getting around the fact that it's a very high-risk situation.
Routine, I assure you.  I just wanted to gage my health.  Am I healthy?
I'm going to ask you a question that may sound peculiar.
You have?
Twenty miles?  I see.
It's a tremendous amount of work -- moving.
You don't think I love you?
Why are you polishing it -- in bed -- in your pajamas -- at 11:15 at night?  Are you going to show it to someone?
... People that were made to be parents, and people who were not made to be parents... My parents, were people who were not made to be parents but had kids anyway.  I don't want us to be that way Ellen.
Don't bring it in here -- it probably has all kinds of diseases.
When I was ten, my family lived in Pacifica for a year.  I used to go to the beach everyday that summer. I never felt so happy, carefree. It was a magic place for me... That's where my heaven will be.
Doubts?  About what?
It's going to look beautiful when he turns out to be that animal who paid a visit to the Steadman's house.
Jumped where?
You tell stories?
You know what -- that was a really good story... Tell it again.
By car right?
Umm, no.  It's just that --
Write from your heart.  That's why the classics are great.
Tomorrow.
... Round The World In Eighty Days. ... Hello Kris.
She wasn't certain... I never really showed her.
I said, 'I would do anything for her'... and she didn't believe me. I said, 'I'd walk across the country for her'... she didn't believe me.
So I've been informed.
What, come on?
Mr. Parker, I'm supposed to give you your fish sticks.
How are you feeling?
No alcohol. You gotta get something else. Everything's ten dollars. What do you want?
Orange soda?
Coffee?
You were going to get my door.
To death?
It's not about sex, Ben. I'll make you up a bed on the sofa. Do it for me. We can talk till late and then sleep till late. As you know, I am my own boss.
I don't know.  I'll go and sort it out today. Why don't you come?... We'll find a real room for me. You can pick it out, a tower on the strip.
Let's face it, Ben, we're having fun here. I've never done so much talking in my life.
That is what I want. Why don't you go and get your stuff?
What?
Very well... umm... I never expected to have to ask you this again... but how did our evening go? I remember getting to the casino... I remember kissing you... that was really nice but everything after that is a blank.
Can we just forget it?
Can we just ignore it?
Thank you, Sera.
Sorry. Look... you seem like a nice girl. I'm just sick of everyone in this town trying to get my money.
What do you think... you are sixteen years old on Hollywood Boulevard?
I didn't do it! I walked in, saw my husband lying on the floor, bent down to check his heart, screamed my head off and Chutney and Enrique ran inside.
You're fired. I have new representation.
That's not what's important.
He means well. He's really brilliant and all.
No.
Not that I saw. But like I said, I went straight upstairs to take a shower.
Yes.
Who's askin'?
Huh?
That's touching, Elle, but we need an alibi.
About the alibi --
Not really. I know how competitive it all is --
Uh -- both?
Forget it. I've already spent too many hours crying over you.
Definitely! I love him!
That's because men are big, fat retards who don't -- Oh, my God...
No. Sometimes I say "Okay" instead of "Fine".
I'm still can't believe you didn't tell Donovan the alibi.
Well, I don't want to look like I know what's coming...
Neat.
I wasn't gonna --
Aside from that.
Why?
She married an old man, she's made a living on telling women they're too fat, she hawks her crap on the Home Shopping Network...
But maybe it is --
No, she can't move for an hour.
That is a direct result of anti- blonde discrimination!
Well, you should -- If you look good, you feel good and if you feel good, you project joy into the world.
Law school was a mistake. Getting this internship was a mistake.
Is he the only one?
I don't know! I don't know anything any more!  I just need to be by myself.
What, like on va-kay?
Oh, my God! I completely forgot to tell you!
I can't believe you're a Laker Girl!
I'd rather have a client who's innocent.
You're applying for my internship, aren't you?
And I fully support that.
Elle, c'mon, there's no way you'll get the grades to qualify for one of those spots. You're not smart enough.
Are you serious?
Chuck.
This is another victory, my friends. What began with the lash shall be concluded with a caress.
What do you want with me?
I like well what I see.  It pleases me.
You... you're a beast!
Protection?
I prefer to think, more like the sagacious owl.
To be my bride, of course.
What will become of me then?
I'm pleased you're not troubled by the prospect...
Your soul...?  Why should I bother with such a paltry trifle?
Later, beloved... Now I wish only to be with you...
Or looked so beautiful...
Precisely, my darling.  Your animal strength, your primitive power has surfaced... you are what you desire.
Dlagon not like that.  Dlagon is spilit of life... spilit of stlength and goodness.
It's terrible.
Why, Jack, then tis your death song I'll be strumming.
Please don't misunderstand.  I am grateful for your hospitality and --
If you're looking for enchantment, Jack, that I can give thee...
Did you hear?  Twas the killing of the unicorn caused it.
Aye.  Black Baron's mischief.
Save your mischief for the Black Baron.
We march on Castle Couer de Noir within the hour.
I'm sure.  It spoke to me.
Beware.
The foulest.  Mayhap I can cut them free.
Here is a bold champion's reward; to serve as a dwarf's doorstop.
Something the matter?
Tis not the sword that counts, but the man what swings it.  Rest easy, Jack.
We'll find it.
Been telling you that all along, lad.
What magic have we on our side?
What weapon?
I've not heard a note out of you.
Listen to him.  Not in the mood...
I'm not denying it's a joyous day --
Were the Princess Lili to join me I would sing till my lungs burst!
And did you?
Nay.  It was lost.  When I came up for air the pond was frozen over.
Very thrifty.  Even got your arrow back.
Good, lad... Here, Jack, give me a hand with the windlass... There's a good fellow...
Never.
I may have said perhaps...
Sport, indeed.
I detest serpents.
That viper has envenomed the water. No animal will drink here now.
I'm not your judge... nor have I any desire to witness the trial.
I don't know.  They've hurt the unicorn.
Who?
I didn't know... I didn't...  It was so lovely... he was in my lap like... like a baby... and... I...
My own father...
If I were your bride, would the kissing ever stop...?  Do you wish to marry me, Jack?
Oh, la...
In the dark... where I join him...
But... I am a Green Man.  I have no title, nor lands... scarce even a few vines and threads to keep the cold from my body.
And I love you, my husband.
I bring you the only treasure worthy of your loveliness... for naught else in the universe rivals the reflected glory of your beauty.
Well spoke, boy.  You have discerning taste for one so young... Just who might you be?
Where do I find the Baron's castle?
Princess?  I know of no princess.
Tis not the time to speak of cheer.
I'm partial to oaks, as are all faerie folk.  Mayn't I come visit sometime?
I'd be honored.
And charmed, of course.
Do I not please you, Jack?
How so?
You... you... you mortal you!
And as barren of love as stone.
Of course they're alive.  All nature is living.
No speeches!  What's a little swim after sticking worms and ogres?
To Castle Couer de Noir?
There'll be spoils aplenty if you guide us there.  Once we breach the walls, help yourself to all you can carry.
Nay.  Castle Couer de Noir is Devil's work... built with sorrow and grief...
What are you doing?
I would have anyway.
Here, honey!
I'd be more comfortable if you hadn't slept with Josh.  And George would be more comfortable if he weren't dying.
Marilyn Manson...and I guess he's into guys.  I hate nose rings.  And the blue eye shadow thing really isn't working.
Nope.
Monday.
He's not gay.  I found out purely by accident, believe me.
I mean drugs.  I thought you said he was?
You're a good girl.
Let's shut up and not kill her.
I'm supposed to be in Tahoe.
I can't even take a shower here.
I'm okay.
I thought I was helping you.
He's at work while I'm here.
No.
You've been good this week.
Oh...nothing.  Thirty pounds.  I just haven't been very hungry.
I'm sorry.
Alyssa said you don't even have plumbing over there.
We're getting out of the ground today.
The plumber's due out on Friday.
Where are you?  You're driving me crazy, waiting like this.  I want you in me now!
I'm not going!
You don't have a choice.
I warned you yesterday.
You can't promise me anything!  You don't have anything to promise!  You live in a garage!  You don't have cable!  You're not hooked up to the internet because you don't even own a computer!  You don't have a job!
A friend of yours is here.
I'll apologize for everything but today...Today I give a shit.
I'd be in Tahoe having fun if you had given up.
Sun glasses?
After everything he did to you and your mom?
After everything.
That's so weird...
No, but I count them.  In a sock isn't new, you know?
I still don't know what that means.
I wanted you here so we could have a few months together.  Maybe everything happens for a reason.  Something bad to force something good.
You know what mortise and tenon is?
Thanks for telling me.
At least your father tried, George.
Ring the bell before you try the door.
What did you do with your dog?
How many years did I live with your beams and boards?  First in the garage, then in the living room.  We're going to do it, Robin.  Next year.  Next year.  Salvaged floorboards from a house in Pasadena. Doors from a church in New Hampshire...
Where will you live?
I'll be by Saturday to pick him up.
He doesn't want to spend the weekends with you anymore.
At least we'll have a house to show for it.
He's not spending the entire summer with another kid in Tahoe.  If he leaves, I will follow him up there and I will drag him home by his nose ring.  He can hate me.  You can hate me.  He can try to kill me while I sleep.  You can call the police.  You can call your husband or your attorney, but Sam is spending the summer with me.  He's my son.  He's sixteen.  That's it.
That wasn't a dream.  That was Sam.
You're not well.
That thing about I was the most, you know, beautiful person you had ever known.  What was that?
You bit my finger.
What?
No.
Don't even...I'm there.
Who?
Not for me, it ain't.
Well you can't stay here, Biscuit. This ain't no life for a man. Any one of these fellas would give their right arm to be in your shoes. I sure know I would.
Do yourself a favor and find another place where they let you in the front door.
Sharp.
Oh, she's fine. She's just not coming today.
Real nice guy, too. Trumpet player. They moved down to New Orleans.
I'll be right back.
Goodnight, Claude.
He's right, Gibson. Put down the gun and we'll work this out.
Of course I did. He said he'd file an appeal right away. You didn't tell me he was so good looking.
Sure, Claude, whatever you say.
Ten dollars. But I need it to get home.
Sure I do. What's your name again?
Good old Monroe.
Did those two muscle heads shake you down? Swear I've seen them down at the track with Sure-shot Riley. That's it, ain't it? A gambling debt.
Start your job? What kind of job?
That thing? Who'd you steal it from?
I must have left my appetite outside, which is where I think we ought to be right now.
Reward?
What ain't there?
He does it all by himself.
You know what I'm saying.
What do you know about boats? I bet you can't even swim.
You still got that map?
New York's a long way's off. Let's just keep moving, okay?
That gripes my soul, man. We're out here in the middle of nowhere. There is shit nibbling at my balls! Don't tell me you don't know where we're going!
The hell you talking about? What train?
Hell, yes, Yankee Stadium. Bombers are playing a double-header against the Red Sox.
What am I gonna eat?
I'm sick of watching Camp 12 win the championship. Every year they get to roast the victory pig and we get dick. This year I want that pig.
That's the way it is.
That was five years ago.
You haven't driven in 40 years, you ain't even got a license. Man's taking his life in his hands, putting you behind the wheel! Where you taking him?
This boat's gonna sail without you, too. I don't care if I last one day out here. At least it's one day of freedom. Now gimme those keys.
We'd be in the hole by now. Hey, man, you're peeing on my shoe.
What'd you say?
I saw that hot dog guy in the bathroom urinating. He didn't wash his hands.
I try to moisturize regularly.
What happened to 'em after that, Willie?
1932? That's like, that's like...
Of course nobody believed Ray and Claude.
Don't argue with me. You need it more than I do. I know how a little money can help in a place like this.
Sure I've been to the Cotton Club. It's pretty sweet. But it don't hold a candle to the Boom Boom Room. That's where the real action is.
I'm talking about old Satchmo nearly blew the roof off the joint.
Alright, Ray, you've got a deal. Pick your man and get going.
How about this? I stay here enjoying my Schnapps and you go back.
Hey, that's Dad's throne! How did Adrian get that? Is Dad okay?
It's just such a slap in the face.
You mother...
Weed lowers the body temperature.  I read that... in, uh... er, science magazine.
My brothers told me my mother was a mountain goat. Which would explain my chronic halitosis.
That turn you on there, RuPaul?
I also have this odd pain in my mid section. Kind of a hollow feeling...
Okay, just point me in the right direction next time.
Maybe you love her. But what do I know? I'm baked out of my mind.
Sure, pop. Whatever you want.
Put it back on my head. I'm falling apart here.
Cassius, didn't I tell you to stay out of your brother's mind?
Metallica, Dad. Come on.
How bad?
Please, Nicky, get back up there.  Try to hurry.
Could you maybe not tell anyone about this?
Boogerland!
That's nice, Grandpa. Why don't you just enjoy the fishing?
I can't enjoy anything. I go fishing. I catch nothing. I go to orgies, I catch everything...
I'm just a demon, Nicky. I don't got devil blood in me. I'd last two minutes up there with your brothers.
You're not saying it's up to me?
You're the spawn of Satan. You got it in you.
Yeah. You do it.
That way.
So I followed him...
I was DeNiro!
Dude, it's us. Let us in.
I'll just go to Heaven.
I'm sorry. It's really tough when your parents get older.
School?
Why would you be floating?
I don't know. Maybe it's because of your sweet voice.
Yes...
...to decompose. And I love my Dad very much. So I came to Earth to save him but then crazy eyes stole my flask and I met you and... well, my dog tells me I just might be in love with you.
And sorry, man, but no dogs allowed.
Shut up! Shut up your damn mouth!
I am.
Has anyone ever broken in to where the babies are?
Of course not! I'm curious, not sick. 
What an old, old man you're getting to be, Francis. Weren't you ever a Yellow? I bet you were even wilder than --  come on, Sandman.
You? Why? You're already beautiful.
Did you ever see anybody renew?
Of course.
Holly. Holly! Please... The other Sandman. Remember the one who came after --
I never go upstairs. You're a nice old lady.
You prefer women?
Jessica.
No.
I thought I had to do something.
Then it's still no.
About running, dying what?
Insane. Nurseries are better than any mother could be.
Uh-uh.
I don't remember exactly... except I was a Green.  What would you like to relive, Logan?
But what is this -- why?
Where? Sanctuary? Can you take me there?
I -- I can't.
Why, Jessica? You're still a green.
I doubt it.
How would anyone know? Even if we find it -- we can never go back.
You know, Jessica.
"Beloved Husband". "Beloved Wife". What can all that mean?
He had a mother and father -- and he knew them.
Where are you going?
Do you want to see Doc?
A Sandman can get as sick of his face as anyone else. Where's the doctor?
My name's Holly... Holly 13. In ancient times they said my number was unlucky. Do you believe in luck?
I have always been here...
Have any other people ever passed through?
Mother and -- ? You knew your mother and father?
No -- I'm sorry. It's not possible.
No, no, no
Not yet.
It doesn't matter who we are. Follow the tunnel to the end.
It kept going off for some reason. False alarms.
I forgot. Anyway, I hate the idea of acting paranoid.
As best we can.
Yeah.
Pete... Don't...
Are you gonna be a man about this, Pete?
We gotta get the stuff and get out of here.
They wanted to know if we'd had a chance to find out what happened to you the other night. They wanted to know if you remembered anything.
No.
His physical condition.
Warden, it's not him. It was not Fred Madison in that cell.
Of course, it's Madison!!! Who else could it be?
He's in the infirmary, being examined.
Yeah, Mack?
Nothin'.
Aspirin... fly head. I gotta have more aspirin.
Called? When?
All right.
But...
He's got some fucked up friends.
I thought there might be somebody inside.
Andy's from Utah. He says there you have a choice... You can die by hanging or by firing squad.
Do they aim for the head or for the heart?
The heart, I guess.
Whatever you say, Mr. Eddy.
I'm really glad you're doin' okay, Pete.
That's good, Pete. Hey... I want you to talk to a friend of mine.
What do you mean?... You've been acting strange lately... Like the other night.
Come on... get in.
I'll dispatch a convoy to meet him.
Uh-huh.
You see, from this vertebrae I shall be able to reconstruct the entire skeleton.
Look here
Well, you just reverse it. Your left hand is  What difference does it make what 'hand' you are? The north is the north!
Believe me, it's no fun. When you fellas picked me up at Baskul, they'd been on my tail for a year.
colossal nerve you have sitting there and talking about it so calmly - you, the swindler of thousands of people
You know, that's what makes the whole thing so funny. A guy like me starts out in life as a plumber - an ordinary, everyday, slew-footed plumber - and by the use of a little brains, mind you, he builds up a gigantic institution, employs thousands of people, becomes a great civic leader. And then the crash comes - and overnight he's the biggest crook the country ever had.
Okay, Lovey.
Horns? What kind of horns?
So that's where you are. I might of known it. No wonder you couldn't hear me.
This doesn't obligate me in any way.
They were in a quandary, and
Come on, Lovey.
Not for me, thanks. No, I'm too weary.
Please! Please! Do not wait for me! I eat so very little.
Say, what about that gold deal?
We find, in the Valley, it makes for better happiness among the natives. We rule with moderate strictness and in return we are satisfied with moderate obedience. As a result, our people are moderately honest and moderately chaste and somewhat more than moderately happy.
You have no disputes over women?
And very true. Your lives are therefore, as a rule, shorter, not so much by natural death as by indirect suicide.
That's all very fine if it works out. A little amazing, of course.
The High Lama arranges everything, Mr. Conway.
Leave Shangri-La! That's not likely. You couldn't drive her out.
No doctors?  That's fine. That's just fine.
Now, what would you like to do?
Thank you.
Pardon me
Are you so certain you are away from it?
You've been lying to us ever since we got here! Apparently it's worked with some people. Perhaps it's because they lack the courage to do anything about it. But not me, Chang. You're up against the wrong man. I'll get out of here, if I have to blow this fantastic place into the valley! I'll get outporters or no porters!
What is it, my son?
Sondra Bizet.
Hello? Colonel?
Yes, Bob.
Hurray for us. Did you say that we left ten thousand natives down there to be annihilated? No, you wouldn't say that. They don't count.
Do try to sleep, Bob.
Dead?
It means we're in unexplored country - country nobody ever reached.
Thanks.  I suppose all this comes under the heading of adventure.
It's far from over, from what I can see. This place gives me the creeps, hidden away like this - no contact with civilization. Bob, you don't seem concerned at all.
Something happened to me, when we arrived here, George, that - well - did you ever go to a totally strange place, and feel certain that you've been there before?
You're a strange bird. No wonder Gainsford calls you the man who always wanted to see what was on the other side of the hill.
That's what you said.
George, I've been putting things together. Do you notice the resemblance between those natives and the pilot? And why did those clothes materialize so conveniently when they met us at the plane? Chang himself just said that they never venture beyond that point. What brought them there? Unless it was to meet us?
Chang's first question was about the pilot.
It's that girl - that girl has twisted and turned
She came here in 1888!
I don't believe it! I don't believe a word of it!
I've already asked them. They're afraid to make the trip. We'll have to send an expedition back after them.
Hiding? Oh, no. Hunting - I was in the interior - hunting fossils. This morning I looked up suddenly
We'll smash his face in. That's what we'll do.
You mean to tell me you're not going to do anything until we land?
Why, you - you Look here - he may dash us to pieces!
We'd be eternally grateful if you
That was easy. I read your books.
I saw a man whose life was empty.
Father Perrault. Of course I can't quite get used to this age thing.
Oh, you're going to make life very simple.
I can't quite explain it, but everything is somehow familiar. The very air that I breathe. The Lamasery, with its feet rooted in the good earth of this fertile valley, while its head explores the eternal. All the beautiful things I see, these cherry blossoms, you - all somehow familiar.  I've been kidnapped and brought here against my will. A crime, a great crime, yet I accept it amiably, with the same warm amiability one tolerates only from a very dear and close friend. Why? Can you tell me why?
You see, it's not a dream.
How could I know that a war was going to break out right over my head!  Right over my head. Oh, my word! I tell you, those Chinese were pouncing on me from every direction. I had to get into these ridiculous clothes in order to escape.
Be quiet! Fenner's the best pilot in China. He knows what he's doing.
Please don't go.
I'm sorry.  I haven't even got any cigarettes left!
Perhaps.
All right, I'll be there.
Thank you.
You'll tell me some of the things I want to know, won't you?  You'll tell me who runs this place. And why we were kidnapped. And what they're going to do with us!
Hesitated, sir.
I gotta be honest about something.
They don't.  Now, son.  If you get the job, you're going to be working with some very particular people who like to do things in some very particular ways.  Here's a little piece of advice:    Don't use this so much.
No. But You'll get used to it.    Welcome to the Men in Black.
I know, that's usually the only time I actually have a shot.  And what if I wanted to see her again?  I'd have to completely re-introduce myself.
I guess it's simple, huh?  They're either gone... or dead.
Hold it.
There's a god damn good reason.
What?
That's the Loch Ness Monster.  And... Kay-- that's... 444-Eyes?
Get back in the car!
You know something?  I actually never think of that.  I gotta get some coffee.
That's my point.  For thirty years you've been looking through things and under things and behind things. Well what I'm saying is maybe this is a time where you should look right at things.  He said our enemy in already here.  Well maybe it is.  Maybe our enemy is, literally, already here.
I haven't been training a partner -- I've been training a replacement.
Oh no, I can't do this job by myself.
With exclusionary frecto-inhibitors?
Do have any idea what I just said?
Well, first of all, it's entomologist.
Man, hey-- maybe you are an entopologist after all.
Out of focus?
Yeah ... ?
I understand.  I understand, thank you. --How about a transmographic dexahydrochlorophallomixaloosalyser?
Yes.  Yes, that's eminently fair of you.
How could it not?
I don't believe you, Mikey.  And you know why I don't believe you? Cause last time you said that you and your pals left eight dozen empty beer cans on the other side of the moon.
I dunno. One?
Did he say where?
How'd you know that?  Kay?
They're not even gonna be your enemie-a if you don't give that to me really soon.
I wanna make a deal.
Seriously.  I'm not going any further until you tell who you are.
So whattya say, kid?  You in or out?
What do we have?  Are we showing anything?
You were right.  I'm not being set up.
I have to go back.
Agatha, you're never going back there.
She died?
Found?  Where?
It's all I could safely move.
Tell you what, since you and I go way back, I'll give you my Old Pal discount.  How's that sound?
They were performance pieces.
I know you're in a hurry, so I juiced up the nano-reconstruction around your new eyes.
It's actually kind of a rush.  They say you get visions; that your life flashes before your eyes.  That all your dreams come true.
I hear you've been spending a lot of time in the sprawl.
How could Witwer have accessed the case file?
Get him some coffee and tell him to wait outside.
You don't have to do this, Chief.
From solar position, Trig & Image confirms it at approximately eight oh-four a.m.
Yeah?  So?
We're in motion on something.
Any ID on the shooter yet?
Your secretaries were all kind enough to give me a look around the office...
You're certain?
Yes.
You ever get any false positives? Someone intends to kill his boss or his wife, but they never go through with it.  How do the precogs tell the difference?
I have a warrant in my pocket that says different.
Possession alone will cost you six months, not to mention your badge.
No.  No way.  I wouldn't even know where to begin!  Those thoughts about my cousin Elena -- they were just thoughts. I would never --
Are you kidding?  There's absolutely positively no way, on my best day, I could ever beat twelve seconds!
The funny thing is, I started to believe he really was my Dad.
I was looking for you...
What the fuck is going on?
The what?
Heal who?
So many of them... despite what we did for them.  Or maybe because of what we did to them.  It doesn't matter.  It's a perfect system now, isn't it?
So you won't help me?
I used to joke with Lamar that we were the mother and father of Precrime.  Well, in my experience, parents often see their children as they want them to be, not as they are.
Why should I trust you?
-- and then walk out.
Which one is that?
No, it isn't, Lamar.  There was nothing anyone could do.
My God...
I know.  He came to me, told me about the missing data stream.  He was concerned that you might find it.
No, I wanna kill my boss!
It's not at all that you don't trust me to be alone with the Chief.  That you think I might, you know, fuck with him, if I had the chance...
Knott!
Sure.  Raincheck.
Cream and sugar.
That was our apartment.
But I've seen the three hundred hours of your image he's got stored away.
Tell me how all this works.
What do you think?  So he can kill whoever he wants to without anyone knowing about it.
You're Bobby, right?
Are you sure?
Thank you very much, sir.
Is it the good room?
It's as good a suite as we have, unless you want two bedrooms.
No. That's cool. Bring me back eighty.
Where's the place to go tonight?
Yeah 'women.' If I was a fag I could get laid in a subway.
Don't worry about me getting in. Just tell me where it is.
You girls aren't from Brooklyn or anything?
No.
We're in Fashion.
Holy shit.
I'm having fun, Sean. Can you handle that...? Yeah. He doesn't judge me.
What? You don't think Horrace would leave your white ass in there to hang?
Show uncle Ricky what you made.
Uncle Bobby?
What time is it there?
She's downstairs with Ruth. Get ready.
I want you to take her with you.
But what about them?
Get your hands off of her.
I don't get it.
5-5-1.
Nah, man. He's just making contact. That's our man. The Welsh guy.
She was fast, huh?
Bobby, I love Jessica like she's my own daughter. I would kill anyone so much as lays a finger on her or her beautiful daughter, but that fucking pisher you socked in the mouth has the most expensive dentist in Beverly Hills and wants I should buy him an implant. Your silverback horseshit's gonna cost me eight grand.
No.
You're ready to move up. Christ, the way you busted up the place, you're doing worse already. May as well get paid instead of punished.
You want us to be wherever you want us to be, ASAP, no questions asked.
Take a few days --
What drill?
Nah, man...
I didn't tell him shit. He worries too much. I love that old Jew, but he's gonna kill himself worrying. We started this shit, and we're gonna finish it.
You three are gonna meet him for dinner. Find out if and where. Now any of you motherfuckers got anything else to say?
Bobby.
Soho.
You don't know where you're going?
Any time, bro.
So?
It's not losing record.
No. You've been waiting for this kind of opportunity.
Shhh...  Yeah, yeah... No. No. I'll be there.  You gotta get me to the Magic Castle at four.
Jesus Christ, fine. Alright?
Why not? I grew up in bars. It's fun for a kid.
I'm not painting the fu --, I'm not painting the ashtray. And frogs aren't purple.
This paint sucks. The white shows through.
Nah, don't bother --
Unless we're supposed to whack out the fuckin' pilot, I don't think we're gonna have to work in the next five hours.
C'mon, man...
How much was it?
Great. On my fucking room.
No. Tell me. What's so fucking horrible about this gig? You've been crawling up my ass for six months to get your name on Maxie's list, and here we are.
Oh, give me a break. Don't tell me you feel bad for the guy.
You know he fucks all his girls, don't you?
What the fuck is that supposed --
Missing what? He didn't say shit.
You too?
Yeah, me too. You're a fucking bull in a china shop.
Yeah. Where they gonna whack us?
Yeah. Let's look at the penguins.
You wanna see how fast I get a gun?
I don't want to take any more chances.
Show me. Show me where it says Screech on the fucking list.
You look good, man.
Cool.
Ugh...
Yes.  Would you care for another one?
I know what 'strapped' means, motherfucker. What the fuck you think this shit is? '21 Jump Street?'  Cool out, they're coming back. Just throw up your screw face and don't speak unless spoken to.
What the fuck, 'Red Dragon?'
Pity. What's say we have a drink?
That shouldn't be a problem.
You'll love it.
Not usually. Mostly Trustafarians.
Different.
Four fernet.
We're going to New York?
And the money. Where do we bring the money?
What about my keys?
What?
Frisk me, baby. Give me a real pat down.
Okay, baby. Now you outfitted. You ready to tackle the street?
Yeah, and I'm putting my money where my ugly mouth is. I'm putting you back in the numbers right now.  Baby, what's today?
Then skip it, man. But you slipping, baby. You done slipped.
I don't want your money.
You could of been something, Archie, but the devil got to you.
Man, what do you want?
You need something. It's not a reefer, but it'll help some.
Like what? Looking like me? Like a nigger?! Why don't you want to look like what you are? What makes you ashamed of being black?
I ain't said I'm ashamed.
Let it burn. Maybe you'll hear me then.
Don't con me.
Then what you telling me to study in them for?
You want a new car? You want a new house? Is that it? It's the money, right?
Not exactly, but I want to be one, like you.
Mr. X, I won't make you out a liar.
She ate.
You've been on your feet for days. And didn't even finish your salad.
They want you to quit the Muslims or they won't pay your tuition, isn't that it?
Why do you ask?
Just an idle question.
The simplest thing in the world: I want to have a lot of babies with you. Dear Heart, I love you.
The talk is everywhere!
There's always talk, always been talk, and always will be talk. Don't they say how I'm trying to take over the Nation, how I'm getting rich off the Nation?
I was going to talk to Bembry about it tonight.
What do you want me to do? Our people need me.
Families shouldn't be separated. I'll never make another long trip without you and the kids. We'll all be together.
That's enough, Brother Earl.
Let's cancel.
As Jesus was. Jesus was also a Hebrew.
Then we don't know that God was white.
Are you Elijah's pimp?
But our crime wasn't burglary. It was balling white girls. They gave us the book.
Why? Is it because of your white gal? Folks say you're running around town with her.
All of your children are delinquent, Mrs. Little, and one, at least, Malcolm is a thief.
If you don't move out through that door, you're going to be past all regretting.
To wire your car so it would explode when you turned the ignition. The Ministers say you are spreading untruths about the Messenger. The Ministers say you are a great hypocrite, Judas, Benedict Arnold. The Ministers say your tongue should be cut out and delivered to the Messenger's doorstep.
The hell you are.
You the man!
I'm the man.
You heard the Sergeant. Outside.
Brothers of Brother Johnson.
He told you that?
I want to arrest you for murder! I want to shake your hand and reload your gun! I want to kill my pride and give you my blessing.
[Everything on the cellphone. We wait for calls. We have no number to call.]
[The what?]
[Four-seven-four-seven.]
[The ransom money. At the drop. He said Tazinari, one of the policemen had taken it. He was crazy.]
[Romans, chapter 12, verse 21.]
I don't know, but I know his face.
[How do I recognize him.]
Japanese are here in a big way. Cheap labor. Factory space. But they feel a lot safer living over the border in El Paso. I ferry 'em back and forth. They think I'm John-fucking- Wayne.
Everything happens once if you live long enough.
You do your best. They won't be paying you enough to perform miracles.
I said the plan was right here.
Different door. Not far from here.
They can stay for two weeks. I don't care.
What did you do in Asia? Is that where you met the man with cigarettes?
I don't understand.
I know you're not.
I'm going to keep people safe someday. Just like you.
You got that right.
Los Arcos. Was a little girl kidnapped recently? About twelve maybe?
And now every mother with money in Mexico City wants bigger and better bodyguards. My own wife included.
For a few months. Hire someone cheap. You have to have a bodyguard to keep the insurance. Then fire him for incompetence. The important thing is Lisa's daughter will return to school.
She understands men.
[He has a heart condition. Angina. He responds badly to stress.]
When?
These people are professionals. They don't waste their time taking children whose fathers are virtually bankrupt.
Creasy. Pinta likes him.
[We did voice analysis of the last five high profile kidnappings, including the little girl. The same man 'The Dreamer'. Listen to this.]
I already ate.
You helped him get this job.
The kind that gets divorced, but still stay friends.
What was she to Creasy then?
You told me that she was a little tall, but that she wasn't bad looking at all.
Which one was that?
Oh, yeah.
I'll call her up.
There's a nice-looking little short one for you right now.
Down there. That little one there.
You want me to ride down with you?
I was gonna call that girl from last night. Take her to a movie tonight.
I don't feel like going, Angie. I thought I'd take this girl to a movie.
She wasn't so bad.
You know the old man upstairs in this house. Old Irishman, always drunk. He got pleurisy. He was inna hospital two weeks. He died yesterday.
Oh, Catherine, please! Don't make a tragedy. You come to my house where you know you be happier yourself.
It pains that they should do this.
Catherine, my sister...
Who?
Oh sure.  This girl is a college graduate.
That's the first time Marty ever brought a girl to this house. She seems like a nice girl. I think he has a feeling for this girl. You heard him sing. He been singing like that all morning.
I'm a Catholic, you know, and even to think about suicide is a terrible sin.
I like you. I like you. I been telling you all night, I like you...
I'll call you up tomorrow morning. Maybe, we'll go see a movie.
All right.
No, Mrs. Pilletti. We were just going home. Thank you very much anyway.
It's a very sad business, I tell you. A woman, fifty-six years old, all her life, she had her own home. Now she's just an old lady, sleeping on her daughter-in-law's couch. It's a curse to be a mother, I tell you. Your children grow up and then what is left for you to do? What is a mother's life but her children? It is a very cruel thing when your son has no place for you in his home.
Couldn't she find some sort of hobby to fill out her time?
It's silly of me to argue about it. I don't know the people involved.
I'm stag.
Oh, that's a sad story.
Marty, see that my mother is nice and comfortable, eh?
What girl, what does she know?  Why don't you let her hold the baby once in a while?! Your mother, boy, she wantsa take the kid for a day, that's fine!
Sure! Sure! It's gonna be nice! It's gonna be nice! I'll come over tonight to your house, and I talk with Catherine, and you see, everything is gonna work out all right.
Marty, I don't want you hang arounna house tonight. I want you to go take a shave and go out and dance.
You gonna get married.
Marty...
Oh, it's a sad business.  My sister, Catherine, she don't get along with her daughter-in-law, so she's gonna come live with us.
You don't like her. You only met her for two minutes.
Hiya, Ralph...
You still owe me ten bucks from last week, if that's what you're working up to.
No, that's my other brother, Freddie. My other brother Freddie, he's been married four years already. He lives down on Webb Avenue. The one who got married Sunday, that was my little brother, Nickie.
Oh, Marty, thanks a lot. That really takes a load offa my mind.
Hello, Thomas, how do you feel?
Because I called up Tommy's brother Joe, and I said, "Joe, she's driving me crazy. Why don't you take her for a couple of years?" And he said, "Oh no!" I know I sound like a terrible woman...
I just can't stand it any more! Every minute of the day! Do this! Do that! I don't have ten minutes privacy with my husband! We can't even have a fight! We don't have no privacy! Everybody's miserable in our house!
On accounta...
We want you to do a very big favor for us, Aunt Theresa.
I'll see you at mass tomorrow. We'll sit down and we'll discuss the whole thing.
I don't wanna hear anymore about it, you hear me?
They've hit us on Cherry Hill. I just got word. We have our slack periods but when the action starts, you'll have more work in twelve hours than a civilian surgeon does in a week.
I have been in this Army a long time. I know just what you guys are up to. But there are limits...
Well...  I was going to name you Chief Surgeon...  To consult on both shifts, yours and Frank's.
That's right.
Hospital.
Which hospital?
Not enough to be a pro.
When he sees a little running room, he likes to make a show... you know, stutter steps and cross-overs and all that jazz. Also he never learned to button up when he gets hit, so if you two can get a good shot at him once, you can hurt him.
Perfectionist.
Crabapple Cove. Maine.
Yeah, that's right.  You better get us a chest-cutter before there's trouble.
We didn't have a chance, little Androscoggin College against the Big Green, but there was this blizzard and we held then nothing nothing till the last twenty seconds. Then this great passer of theirs let one go, snow and all...
An application to Androscoggin College.
Same here. You can retire my number.
A football game?
But what about Major Houlihan?
At ease. Captain Pierce, you have a seriously wounded patient for whom you are responsible. Yet I find you in a poker game.
Also I'm curious whether she's a moaner or...
Ho-Jon, give the Father some more martini.
Never mind the conversation. Do it, Dad.
On account he got caught in the doctor draft. He was a surgical resident playing semi-pro ball weekends when the Eagles signed him.
Oh, no. We have dull stretches every week or so, thank God, when there's nothing to do after midnight.
But I'm married.
And absolutely determined to be faithful to my husband. Do we have that in common, Captain?
Ayuh.
Maria...
You're on his side all of the sudden?
It happens to be a matter of life and death.
Yes, I know. Hi, Ho-Jon. How did it go?
They missed the boat.
Thanks.
Poker sounds great. When do you play?
There's only one worth noticing.
You've been drawn to other males? Since you were a kid?
I wonder, if Red's fix swings it for me, what's heaven really like?
They've all tried. Nobody's got to first base.
To Major Burns' tent. Yes, sir.
Splendid, sir. No problems.
I used to throw the javelin.
What's that, Henry?
Um-hum.
Oh, crabby guy, huh?
Against what?
Yes!
Who?
Well, yes, I was. But I was your father then, see?  But the real me, John Doe, er, that is, Long John Willoughby, I was the fellow up there with the book. You know what I mean?
All right, but present it to him as a great cause for the common man.
Mr. D. B. Norton!
You bet I will, Ma.
What's that?
What letter?
Uh-huh. You said you wanted fireworks.
I wish he had a family, though.
Right here. Sit down.
Before you pop too many buttons, don't forget to make out that check for a thousand.
Have you seen him?
Now, that's crazy. It's fourteen floors!
I used to pitch.
No. Her mother's awful worried about her. When she left the house she said she was going on a roaring drunk. Er, the girl, I mean!
Beany!
The heelots!
Tell him about making Sourpuss chairman, honey.
Yeah, sure. Er, you know Grubbel, for instance.
Yeh. Er, and my boss, Mr. Schwabacker made a job in his warehouse for old man Delaney
A what?
No, sir. That spot under the bridge where we slept last night's good enough for me.
Tear down all the fences. Why, if you tore one picket off of your neighbor's fence he'd sue you!
Five thousand bucks!  I had it right in my hand!
John Doe Club?
Hiyah, John.  John, I want to have a little talk with you.  What's the matterare you falling? Come here.
They can't, huh?  Who do you think writes 'em? My Aunt Emma? I know she writes them.
Why, D. B., you're not going to fall for
I want it as soon as possible.
That's right. You got it! Sure! He came in here and I made him change his mind. "Bulletin editor saves John Doe's life." Why, it's perfect. I'll have Ned write it up.  Oh, Ned!
No, no, no, the gal's right. We can't let the Chronicle get the laugh on us! We've got to produce a John Doe now.  Amateur journalism, huh!  I'll show those guys.
Oh, just traveling through, huh?
That's a lie! Listendon't believe what he says . . .
Listen, folks, it's a fact that I didn't write the letter, but this whole thing started
What do you mean, too bad?
What are you doing? Get Connell at the Bulletin !  Why, he's liable to go right past my window,  What was that?!
Well, don't stand there, you idiot. Go and look. Open the window. Oh, why did he have to pick on my building?
No, sir.
I think it must have been a sea- gull.
Maybe we can get a throw phone in there.
"Phoney Frank"? Don't waste your time. He'd tell you his granny was in on the Kennedy assassination if he could dodge a collar.
This cousin of yours... What's his name?
So that we could get the best price. He's got respect for you. He's gonna try to lowball me, Mike.
How can I help you with the particles?
Huh?
Tell him what, what do you want me to tell him?
Is that where you're family lives?
Am I gettin' the car?
I what?
Hi, Kimura. Where's the command post?
Being faxed over now.
And what about bars? We can talk to neighbors to see what bars he frequents.
I'm not wearing a wire. This is just between you and me.
Open the bag, dump everything on the table.
Like it had to be done.
Is there something wrong with that?
I'm not sure.
She's back in Jersey... going to graduate school.
We see each other every couple of months.
It's against my nature.
Yes.
What's the first commandment?
Okay, stop.
I have two words for you... Seek help.
To run late!
COME ON, RUSSELL!
How much you wanna bet?
He's cutting down the visibility.
That it is.
Husband came home. Found that guy and his wife "in flagrante". Now he's holding her at knife point.
I ain't interested in your life story.
What am I giving up? I'm laid off last year. I'm down to my last unemployment check. I'm out on the streets looking for work and this bitch is banging some asshole in my bed.
My name's Scott Roper.
Greg.
Hey yourself. Came by to see Troy.
Mmm, needs a little something.
It's because I wanted to keep you away from that world.
And you think he'll...
Things have been going pretty well between us, haven't they?
You've changed you know. I don't think there's anything you can't do once you put your mind to it.
A deeper level?
Your concern is heartwarming.
Is that what the guy in the Sunday School suit is doing outside?
Is there going to be an expression of your appreciation?
Kimura and Glass will head the investigation.
Halden, how nice to hear your voice.
-- But don't you remember?  I'm already dead.
No, she said she had a son.  In a dream she once called life.
If you could meet God, what would you say to him?
-- No.
Someone who believes in miracles.
Then what?
Not my problem.
Yes.
Yes...
-- But you'll never be able to get it through the maze.
Me?  Of course not.  That's why you're here.
And down here --
And what about the reconfiguration?
It's his nature.
The woman you're stuck on.
-- He won't.
Go!
-- Come on, you know F.C.O. regs. Anyone caught with their R and D hand in the bio-digitization cookie jar spends the rest of their life in federal penitentiary.  It's not worth it.
The truth.
Not his style.
Just like that --
Of course you do.  And the only shot you've got of keeping your ass from sinking in a sea of shit is to tell me where you got this program.
-- Transmit now!
Waiter, busboy, Maitre-De --
-- Standard.
I've never been this sore in my life.
The chamber has been accidently UNCOVERED!  You must return it to the depths. or  anyone should open it and Ivan is released!
Use extreme caution, Rangers. You are dealing with an evil here that is beyond ALL comprehension.
Ryan's Comet!!
Ultra Ninja Megazord complete!
BUT I'M YOUR COUSIN!
From now on it's E-V-I-L, NO exceptions!
What's going on?!
I ain't no fuckin' kike!
And a lot more. Can we talk?
Maybe. But he'd still be the Boss.
You scare me, Charlie.
Up down. Down up. It's the same. You see things through both eyes.
Scared.
Mr. Rothstein, Can I be frank? You're a gambler, and I know you've had losses. I also know you could sell to Maranzano or Masseria for fifty G's, but nobody sells to those guys once. So if ya really got another buyer, and ya wanna welch, I ain't gonna beef.
We got our boys paintin' the house next door. Around the clock. We're gonna keep old man Profaci alive if it takes twenty coats.
That ain't what your mama said.
Guess I'm too confused to think.
I'm very sorry... I didn't...
Lansky. Meyer Lansky. And that's Bugsy Siegel ya got there.
So what is the problem?
Without us, Masseria don't stand a chance, and he knows it.
It's nothin'. I'm gettin' married.
How soon can we pull this off?
It's not myself I'm worried about.
Maranzano will think Masseria ordered the hit, and won't have no choice but to start the war.
Masseria won't have any choice but to trust you. And as long as we keep the Boss alive, Maranzano can't win without you.
I got a place for you. In my family... or in the cemetery.
He'll think something's wrong I ain't there.
I'm still the Boss of All the Bosses! And you'll do what I say!
So tell me when I ain't done it.
Not if they all die at once.
I've heard so much about this club of yours. I had to come and see.
The name's Charlie.
Don, you talk about honor, but you mean vendetta. Killin' an' more killin' until nobody can remember how it all started.
We learn from life.
I turned him down flat.
Just wanted ta say hello.
That a Jew compliment?
Switch hands.
What?
Most we've ever used is half a CC.
Dark Town. Land of nightmares. I'm Bull.
Oh, sure. Now you're gonna tell me it was all <u>his</u> idea. You were completely innocent -
Death, I'm trying to make things right. Take my soul. Turn me into a paper doll. But give me just one lousy hour.
Coming from you, that's quite a compliment.
Death! Thank you!
Thank me next time you see me.
I get it. We could give the public the impression that we were doing something... charitable. Brilliant!!
Being rich is <u>not a trap</u>. That is a dirty lie perpetuated by rich people to keep the failures from killing them.
...In some weird way I respect that.
Kool-Aid!? But who'd would want to -
Oh yeah. Mr. By-the-book, Stick-Up-the-Ass, My- Way-or-the-Highway Death. Believe me - over the course of eternity, you get pretty damned tired of <u>that</u> schtick. <i></i> So I need a job. He sticks me in this broke-down amusement park, with a buncha animals to run it. I'm supposed to be <u>grateful</u>?
But <u>why me</u>? Why'd you pick on <u>me</u>??
You're acting kind of...odd.
Baby, don't lie. I know you went out.
He called me "Doc."
It was you who got the standing O. It was you drawing on the belly over there...
Yeah, I <u>could</u>, but the thing is, if later got here sooner, it would be...better.
Stu - stop it. That monkey is <u>good luck</u>. You thought him up, and everybody loves him, and he's probably going to make you rich. So relax! Enjoy it!
What's the "bad" part?
I might wake up.
<i></i> If you do, I'll be right there beside you. So face it. You're just going to have to be happy!
Baby...you're asking the wrong guy.
When'd you get in?
Listen to me! Is there any way I can <u>warn</u> her what Monkeybone is up to??
<u>I'll</u> worry about the guards. <i></i> OKAY, STU. SEE YOU IN A DAY OR TWO.
Well - yeah - but that doesn't...<u>apply</u>. It was different then. I was <u>depressed</u>. My life is great now. I'm in love!
<i></i> I've got one chance to get back to Julie, and I'm gonna take it - with or without you.
Move it. We got exactly five minutes left.
You want to come inside?
That's why it's good you came to visit me.
What pictures?
Mother!
I'm sorry, I'm a little nervous.  It's my first time in New York.  Just a minute.
Calendar for the day. You'll find the Senate Manual in the drawer. Anything else you want, just snap for a page.
Those busts up there--all around the wall--who are they, sonny?
Swell. Thanks very much.  Good luck, Senator. Keep your left up.
Then--this is *not* you signature, Senator?
Well, why don't they try the police-- get some blood hounds--or Indian guides--
Well, because you're doing all right at the minute.
What's this, Diz?
You got worms.
Now, you've got more sense than to put Nosey onto this guy--!
Yeah. Some of my best friends are funny.
Any time.
Okay. You don't mind?
You've never seen prairie grass with the wind leaning on it, have you, Diz?
What?
You don't know a name off-hand you like better, do you, Diz?
I won't take it! See? I won't be party to murder. See? Steering a poor dope up blind alleys for that grafting Taylor mob is low enough. But helping that dame cut him up in little pieces besides--nobody's gonna make me do that. No, sir.
Huh?
He's a house-afire!
Kid--he thinks he's talking to that mob at home, but not a line we've written--not a word he's said from that floor has gotten into that home State.
What is it?
All right, why?
*You* tell Jim Taylor.
I *won't* let you stand there callously and perhaps wreck my whole political future!
Well--that's not work, sir--that's fun.
Uh--Jefferson Smith's residence?
Yeah, for the fifth time, Senator-- Washington.
My pigeons--I better see about my pigeons.
Boy! My head's like a balloon--for two whole days. I never knew there was so much American history.
What? Who?
I yield.
Ma's told me about it a thousand times.
Shot in the back. I was there. I can see him at that old roll top desk, still with his hat on... still with his hat on...
Goodnight, Jeff.
Yes--the *benefits*! What's a man called Taylor got to do with this?
Will he yield for a question?
He has imputed to me conduct unworthy a Senator--and I demand he be made to yield the floor--!
We'd better see.
Yes, I'm Saunders--and this is Mr. Moore--a member of the press. Meet the *Senator*, Mr. Moore.
Pleased to meet you, sir.
Yes--I think maybe you'd better.
You--uh--you better relax, Senator. You'll be plumb wore out.
Tell me, Miss Saunders--what time does the Senate--uh--what do they call it?
Well, then, I--I *thank* you, Miss Saunders! Nothing better could have happened--. Yes *sir*, Miss Saunders, we're going right ahead with it!
Pardon me. Senator Paine decided this *with* you?
Uh-huh. Well, dinner comes in on trays. We're executives. And we light into this. It is dawn. Your Bill is ready. You go over there and introduce it--
How?
You get to your feet in the Senate and present it. Then you take the Bill and put it in a little box-- like a letter box--on the side of the rostrum. Just hold it between thumb and forefinger and drop it in. Clerks read it and refer it to the right committee--
Yes. House. More amendments--more changes--and the Bill goes back to the Senate--and *waits its turn on the calendar again*. The Senate doesn't like what the house did to the Bill. They make more changes. The House doesn't like *those* changes. Stymie. So they appoint men from each house to go into a huddle called a conference and battle it out. Besides that, all the lobbyists interested give cocktail parties for and against--government departments get in their two cents' worth--cabinet members--budget bureaus--embassies. Finally, if the Bill is alive after all this vivisection, it comes to a vote. Yes, sir--the big day finally arrives. And--nine times out of ten, they vote it down.  Are you catching on, Senator?
Try sitting down.
I did--and--and I got right up.
We need a lot like him--his kind of character--ideals.
About two hundred of the most beautiful acres that ever were! Mountains, prairie land, trees, streams! A paradise for boys who live in stuffy cities--  You don't know that country out there, do you, Miss Saunders?
You--you've *got* a first name, haven't you?
Look--I think we ought to skip it.
It *is* not!
Well--no. I didn't. Why?
Great.
Contributions from boys who read about your camp.
Oh, those are only local. Wait'll they start pouring in from all over the country.
The letters? Gosh--no. I couldn't talk letters. I've gotta scratch 'em out. And say--I'm going to tell Ma all about you. If I tell it right-- the first thing you know you're going to get the best jar of preserves you ever tasted.
Oh--*Saunders*!
Oh--Saunders--
Where do we go from here?
No! No! Gosh. See, there you are! I'm not making sense!
You were about to recognize me, sir--
The Senator will please suspend until order is restored in the chamber.
How's that, buddy?
Oh--you're *sure* of that now?
Yes, *sir*.  Let's *go* Henry.
Great!  The Government's putting dough in too many places *now*!
Yeah? Well, when I get my hands on a red-headed doll with a southern lingo, I'll--
Well, then--this is too much for *my* lame brain. I'm calling Jim Taylor.
Jim's methods won't do in Washington.
No--I'm sorry. I merely saw him home. I'm not supposed to tuck him in and give him his bottle. That's McGann's job.
Nice *compliment*!
I meant it for one. I meant--Sam Foley couldn't get along without you-- and neither can I at the moment--
You're more than that. I've had example of the fact that wild horses couldn't pull confidential matter in these two offices out of you. That's why I tell you what I do--about Smith and this situation. So, you see--
Why don't you do it yourself?
*Me! Me*! I *still* don't see why I should--! If you love him so much, why don't you go to him yourself and-- ? Or better still--get up in that Senate and *fight* for him!
How much does the Willet Dam mean to you, Jim?
Joe--I've got a lot of people to take care of in this State.
What do you think?
Jim, you don't have to--
Jim, it's just that I like the kid-- I don't want to see you get too rough on him.
*I* know what I'm doing! I'll say what I *want*!
I don't care to meet anybody until I get paid--come on--come on. One dollar each, please, for the Milk Fund.
I'm afraid we won't have room in the car, Father. Senator Smith can follow with Mr. McGann and the pigeons.
Do I actually *see* this--?
Senator Paine.
Page boys!
Yes, sir.
Would you like to go for a walk?
Your Honor!
No!
Yes!
NO!!
But they did take place?
That's all, Miss Bennett. That's all.
Oh, that - well, we had another meeting. I told them I'd go on being Chairman if
Uh-huh.
That depends on what they see.
I haven't met anybody here that I like, particularly. They all seem to have the St. Vitus Dance.[12]  Except you, of course.  People here are funny. They work so hard at living - they forget how to live  Last night, after I left you, I was walking along and looking at the tall buildings and I got to thinking about what Thoreau said. They created a lot of grand palaces here - but they forgot to create the noblemen to put in them.
He did? I play the tuba
Sure. I can sing "Humoresque."
It had better be good.
I'd like to read it some time.
All right.
All my life, I've wanted somebody to talk to. Back in Mandrake Falls, I always used to talk to a girl.
Oh, an imaginary one. I used to hike a lot through the woods and I'd always take this girl with me so I could talk to her. I'd show her my pet trees and things. Sounds kind of silly but we had a lot of fun doing it.
Search me. Ask the Gypsies.
No - of course you don't. We've forgotten. We're too busy being smart-alecks.  Too busy in a crazy competition for nothing.
Babe ought to get him drunk again.
Shhh!
Who? Miss Dawson?
Is that the best you've got?
Oh, yes, sir. Here it is, sir. The pate de fois gras, sir.
Mr. Cedar!
It's okay with me as long as my weekly stipend keeps coming in.
You can't?
Mr. Deeds, does the name of Martin W. Semple mean anything to you?
Yes, of course, if you wish. But you must be prepared. This sort of thing will be daily routine.  If it becomes annoying, you let me know. Goodbye, Mr. Deeds. Goodbye, sir.
Nah.
Oh, that's different if it's just poetry.
He was the last baby my father delivered, Arthur was.
Why do mice go where there's cheese?[3]
Only common sense.
Your uncle had a weakness for dark ones, tall and stately. How would you like yours? Dark or fair, tall or short, fat or thin, tough or tender?
What do I care about Arthur! Did you see this stuff in the paper? How'd it get in there? What'd you do last night? Who were you talking to?
Oh, they insisted on following me.
That's my job. I'll take care of that. I'll keep that stuff out of the papers - if you'll help me. But I can't do anything if you go around talking to people. Will you promise me to be careful from now on?
You see, Mr. Deeds, the opera is not conducted like any ordinary business.
That's fine. Thanks. I'll look 'em over later.
What kind of wife did you say she was?
Take the stand!
No.  Yes. There's just one more thing I'd like to get off my chest before I finish.
Christian Svenson.
Farmer?
Yes, ma'am.
Is Mary home?
Yes, lovely. We've had a lot of nice weather lately.
Excuse me. What did you say?
Yes, sir.
Yes, sir. It makes the head feel smaller.
What, sir?
Me more than most.
"There's no shame in getting a little therapy", right, Doc?
What's that?
Oh... a lot of things. Several different factors. Will you see her, Doctor Mumford?
I'm fine.
I think I've heard of him... a disciple of Rothberg, wasn't he?
Henry!
Why? I'm paying for this.
I didn't hear you.
And the experiment is in here?
There's absolutely no reason to think this is going to have any impact on you. I'm embarrassed to have --
I'm not at liberty to say. Sometimes it's just routine, sometimes there's been a complaint. We'll be in touch.
Sorry I'm late... traffic was a motherfucker. Have another drink, I'll be back in five.
Nope.
I've had my moments.
You've done well.
A little.
No... I mean about Althea. About her...  ...behavior. Do you think you can fix her up?
What do you think's wrong with her?
Yes, your honor.
Salad nicoise? I love salad nicoise.
You're terrible. I'm never telling you anything.
Doc.  Ainge...
...And?
It's a pleasure to meet you.
That's it? That's what you're giving me?
Is she a friend of yours?
There's something I think we need to talk about.
What do you mean?
I think you know what I mean.
No, I really don't.
Could I see Sofie, please?
I don't think I can afford it. I don't want my dad paying.
We'll turn back anytime you want.
Is that the technical description of what I've got?
'Cause I'll tell you, none of the others have tried this approach.
Sometimes, yeah... pulling in two different directions at once. It makes tiny little tears in our fabric.
It doesn't matter. Go on.
Oh, there's something wrong with you, all right. Especially after hearing that dream of yours, about the Roto-Rooter.
I bet I know what changed your mind...  ...My mother. She was so horrible, you decided you couldn't desert me.
Is something wrong, Sofie?
Um-huh.
The point is this -- I am not a blank page. I did not just fall off the turnip truck. Do you know what I mean?
Transference.
But...
I don't know. Depends. I'm in a bad mood.
Anything... just ask.
What do you mean, "in no time"?
Weekly or monthly?
What do you want me to see?
What happened today?
What are you talking about?
True. Should we stop them?
He agreed?
Nah... scotch.
Have you thought about getting a wife?
You moved here from back East and your name is the same as this town. Is that right?  Far out.
Well, you know... that's the thing. Like I said, just about everybody in town works for me. And it's just not the same asking someone to throw a ball when they work for you. It's like an order or something... And no one -- no one -- asks me.
I trust you. Definitely. No question. But, yeah, I'm a little concerned. I mean, you're not supposed to tell anyone about your patients' problems... are you?
Sounds like kind of a good idea.
Did you carry a gun?
Didn't need one. We didn't even need a warrant for most of the shit we did. Man, the IRS... we could go in your bank account, your credit cards... hell, we used to go into doctors' files and get all the juicy details. Nobody wants to argue with the IRS.
Jeez, man. But you're good at it!
I understand what it's like to want to leave a problem behind. That's all most people are looking to do.  Mainly, I listen.
Really?
I guess that makes sense.
Lots of institutions. My graduate advisor believed we should experience as many environments as possible -- prisons, clinics, half-way houses. For a while I was chief therapist in a shopping mall. Had a little spot next to the yogurt place.
I don't have one really. Most of the time I'm faking it. See, I think there's not much that can be done about most problems... they're too complicated, too deep-rooted by the time I hear about them. The most I can do, usually, is look and listen real closely, try to catch some glimpse of the secret life everybody's got. If I can get a sense of that, well then, maybe... just maybe, I can help them out a little.
They are evil, cursed, they matter not.
You're not going to kill us?
The ritual to bring the body of Anck- su-namun back to life.
And then killing your sister.
Shut-up and gimme your bandolier.
In the desert? What for?
'Cause I look good doin, it.
You left me! You left me in the desert to rot.
This is Prince Imhotep, High Priest of Osiris.
Oh, hey, how ya doin'?
Who needs smart women? I put up with you because your mother and father were our finest patrons, Allah rest their souls. Now straighten up this mess!
I am an English woman.
Forty.
I have come to protect my investment, thank you very much.
If you call that a kiss.
Yes, I'm hoping to find a certain artifact, a book, actually, my brother thinks there's treasure. What do you think is out there?
Well of course I can swim, if the occasion calls for it.
Why would they bury somebody in the ceiling?
I know, you're wondering, what's a place like me doing in a girl like this?
It's just a book, no harm ever came from a book.
No, we are not.
Yeah? So? Is that my problem?
It's everybody's problem!
He was the last Pharaoh of the Old Kingdom, said to be the wealthiest Pharaoh of them all.
Alright, good, that's good. I like this fellow, like him very much.
Undoubtedly, I know the breed, he may be a cowboy, but his word is his word.
I only gamble with my life, never my money.
Awfully.
No kiddin', without a key, it'll take us a month to crack this thing,
Yes, I know, I do that to people.
What?
He's a big fellow with pointy ears and a face like a falcon.
I know you did.
And what's that?
I was only strangling her... I've killed hundreds of women. It doesn't mean a thing.  Pootchkie, you're over-reacting. This is our night. It's what we've lied for... cheated for... murdered for. She's just a plaything, a trifle... You're the only woman who's ever meant anything to me. I adore you. I worship you. I want to make you my bride.
I'm his daughter.
The cape. The turban. She wouldn't understand.
But in fact... you'd found it.
Elizabeth! Little Elizabeth! Why you're so... middle aged!
He's dead.
Oh that's right -- they squished him... Heck of a guy.
Well, I give to the United Way, and I feel that sort of covers --
And the nuts always call themselves great.
You're dead.
Just a waitress.
It's home.
What have they got that we ain't got?
That's what I mean... 'Night, Roy.
Are you nuts? Get out of there!
Yes.
He's got the fact that he's Superman!
Are you coming or not?
There's a vague similarity.
Roy, when was the last time you had an actual date?
Wait!... Look!
No one's sure that he actually exists, but they say he can be contacted by leaving a message on a crumpled up napkin at the Tacky Taco down by the bus station.
Yes.
No.
Yes.
Really? Like Captain Amazing?
Wow.
Of course. I'm such a fool... Thanks, Mummy.
Because... I'M A SUPERHERO!
I always knew that you were special.
Ask her out.
Who are they?
Or Batman --
Shut up.
Crime was rampant. It wasn't safe to stay in your home.
With or without him, we gotta go!
Right.
You know, General Kutusov, there is a very strong possibility that the fire was not started by Napoleon's troops but was organized under the orders of Rostopchin's secret police.
I am at your disposal, Your Majesty.
Ah -- you approve?
To be perfectly honest, I haven't the vaguest idea.
The 21st Dragoons, about two or three-hundred troopers.
Where are they?
I'm not insulted.
Paris is evacuated, sire.  The enemy is to enter at nine o'clock tomorrow morning.  The National Guard is on duty at the gates.
I don't know, sire -- she had the Tsar's personal physician.
I suppose I might blame her for opening her house to the men most responsible to my downfall, but how can I?  She was on her own again, she had to look after her own affairs, and how can one blame her for having her head turned by the attention of Kings?
Bertrand, sire.
Oh, shit, that's not right.
Come back in an hour.
Yes, sir.
Yes, sir.
Yes, sir.  I hope you will excuse me for asking, General Bonaparte, but are you Corsican?
My God -- don't you recognize Mouton -- our regimental dog?  I would rather eat Cossack.
I fear our meeting is long overdue... Napoleon.
Yes, it is.  It must be one of the worst nights we have had this winter.
Are you staying with a friend, sir?
Oh, yes... of course.
Not even the slightest hint of something?
But you can do the same thing in six months.  The next few weeks may be the most important ones in your life.
Of course not, but such violence of feeling makes me wonder.
And, you seem in excellent health, Your Highness.
Yes!!
Goodbye.
Well, he didn't give it to me, and when I ask you to do something for me, return the work to me, not to Berthier.
He's downstairs -- somewhere.
That's all you can say?  What are you talking about?
There are some things... better left unsaid.
Well, whatever the hell you wanted to do, you are going to tell me everything right now.  Do you understand?!
I wrote it.
Yes?
And was it so widely known that Joseph had reason for such concern?
Before you quote the rules of the road to me, Major, may I point out to you that you are not in France now, but that you are a guest in Russia.
Those are extremely harsh terms.
England can make no move against you on the Continent without Austria.  A reliable treaty with Austria would end her hopes in that regard.
And where do you place Alexander?
He will stand by his agreement -- I know him better than you do.
Eugene de Beauharnais.
Citizen Bourrienne to see you, sir.
Duroc, I have a bill here for 600,000 francs from Tirot, for building the Imperial throne and six decorated arm-chairs.  The amount is absurd -- and, at least twice too much.
Yo' cousin, Craig.  Hook us up.
Suga!
Yup.
Well get along with this one.  Go ahead of us.  Don't get seen and don't let that mutt out of your sight.
Whatever you say, man.  I didn't see shit.  The safe combination is 34-5-27. Just take it all.
You.  Hi, Uncle Willie.
Must be nice.  I wish we won the lottery. Come up on a million dollars like ya'll.
Yeah, I'm alright.  Is my face still orange to you?
What's the matter with your girlfriend?
You got a restraining order on a little girl named Baby D?
What's the B-G's?
Craig and Karla, damn that sound pretty good together.  Where you going?
I don't know.
What??  So you snuck in my room to tell me that?
Thanks for noticing.  It used ta be peaceful before they got out.  Took over the house and caused my mother's nervous breakdown.
Why didn't she put'em out?
Hold on.
Delinquent Property Tax Notice... I hope the Cracker Killers pay well 'cause if not, back to the ghetto you go.  Wife stays here, of course.
Well bring yo' ass on...
Have you seen Day-Day?
Well, you gonna have to go postal then.
I feel you.  I've just been practicing that one move all week.  I thought that was it.
Are you out your mind?  I'm not messing with them S.A.'s boy.  You must be crazy.
I don't know.
Hey, man, the pleasure's all mine. Thanks for the dog, and the money.  Maybe my dad won't kick my ass tonight.
What?!  This look like a 7-11 or something?  Get the fuck outta here!
Nothing.  What you want?
I got my mase.
It's an important speech.
Who, him? Just visiting.
What happened here?
Business or pleasure?
'S okay. What do you think?
One loud scream will bring them in here instantly. You won't get very far. Think it over.
That's right.
I don't know. The only thing I know about him is that he works for your husband.
Of course. I'll get a car to drive you.
You wouldn't...
What are you going to do about it, shoot me?
No! You can't! They're in on it.
Nods solemnly. GENE reaches the platform and gives out an exaggerated sigh.
I promise.
No. Kisses to you.
It's a twenty.
Oh, man...
Hey, a big tip doesn't give you the right to crap in my ear. You want change?  You got it, brother. What was that you gave me, a twenty?
What are you going to do now?
I don't have to pay you nothin'.
Gimme a dollar.
That's good.  That's good, sweetie pie.
Not very far, honey-pie. Not far at all.
Yeah.
Frogs. They copy our blue jeans and when we need their help in Kuwait, where the fuck are they?
Just put her on.
He took the secret with him when I dropped him.
That's right, Preacher. I robbed that bank because I got tired of seein' children roamin' the woodlands without food, children roamin' the highways in this year of Depression; children sleepin' in old abandoned car bodies on junk-heaps; and I promised myself I'd never see the day when my youngins'd want.
I come not with Peace but with a Sword.
What religion do you profess, Preacher?
If you was to let that money serve the Lord's purposes, He might feel kindly turned towards you.
And I won't never tell about the money.
Pshaw now! Ain't it a caution what women'll load onto a feller's back when he ain't lookin'?
Yep; gotta watch out for Pearl, Uncle Birdie.
Yes! Yes!
The Lord said, Take that money and throw it in the River!
Yes! Yes! Hallelujah!
Yeah, and ornerier than the rest.
Got a good buy in soap, Miz Cooper.
Now, Mother, a body can't help their feelin's.
Sshhh! He's in there.
All to pieces!
A man of the Cloth?
You and your gypsies! They been gone a week!
It's awful soon after Ben's passing.
John don't like him much.
What he needs is a dose o' salts!
I declare, you'll let that money haunt you to your grave, Willa Harper!
Well, shoot! Maybe there was!
Is that all?
You think you can make me tell! But I won't! I won't! I won't!
NO, -- it ain't fair to make Pearl tell when she swore she wouldn't. I'll tell.
Don't you believe me?
Why sure, boy, sure.
I'll tell you a secret.
Tell me another secret about my Dad.
Can I have milk too?
Yes. But first of all we'll have a little talk.
Why, pray tell?
Ahhh.  And is there -- a doll?
Harry, what --
I'm through, Harry.
How you figgerin' to raise them two without a woman?
The Drugstore?
Miz Cooper. I never went to sewin' lessons all them times.
Pearl and John.
Since the murder. She was fine before that.
Thank God.
She's entering deep sleep now. Heart rate's a little high due to anxiety, but otherwise she's nicely relaxed. All normal. She could dream at any time now.  Right now she's like a diver on the bottom of an ocean no one's mapped yet. Waiting to see what shows up.
Yeah. Something slippery all over here...  Tina?
No.
They got a whole system they call 'dream skills'. So, if you have a nightmare, for instance like falling, right?
Yeah.
How you plan to do that?
Deal.
Krueger?
Okay.
Go on...
Well then how can you say somebody else was there?
Really. Turn 'er up a little.
Jungle man fix Jane.
No more fights.
Guys can have nightmares too, y'know. You ain't got a corner on the fucking market or something.
Bring me forty-five back.
Too bad... you missed an inspiring day, Anna.
That's just it. It makes people feel queer. I dont' want you to get in any trouble.
It was very silly.... I would be ashamed to wear it here.
You mean to tell me you wear a different dress for different times of the day?
And there?
They must have wonderful materials to make a thing like this so soft... something you don't even see.
What is it, Anna?
You know I told you that Pavlov and I are going to get married when he comes back from the maneuvers. Would it be asking too much...
You want this?
You can have it for good. It is my wedding present.
Or it might be the firing squad!
But what can we do?... We have to accept.
Very good. The last mass trials were a great success. There are going to be fewer but better Russians.
You didn't get legal advice?
Yes, Comrade?
With two f's, if you please.
But, Comrades...
Who gave you this idea? What is responsible for all this?
Shall I draw your bath, sir?
Very well, Your Highness.
I want you to know all the White Russian exiles in Paris are keeping their fingers crossed about the jewels. They are very interested in the case. Swana suspects her countrymen.
They hope the settlement will bring you a fortune.
Count d'Algout...
Let's be honest. Have we anything like it in Russia?
If Lenin were alive he would say, "Buljanoff, Comrade, for once in your life you're in Paris. Don't be a fool. Go in there and ring three times."
Do we give the impression of people who are pressed for money?
Thank you for a wonderful dinner.
...Ali Baba and the Forty Thieves... into one single hour you can crowd a thousand and one nights.
My name is Count d'Algout. I telephoned.
Just looking around.
Monsieur.
But, gentlemen, I am afraid...
We haven't anything to discuss with you. We'll talk to a lawyer!
We did our best, Comrade.
You, Comrade Iranoff, go to the Public Library and get me the section of the Civil Code on property.
Oh yes, Power and Light. Thank you.
The hearing is set for the twentieth of this month.
We did our utmost to have it set ahead.
Count Leon d'Algout... a count!... a nobleman!
Business.
Believe me, I have no connection with her any longer... I swear I haven't!
I must get into that country of yours!
Now look here... you advertise all over the world that you want people to go into your country and when someone tries to get in, you keep him out!
Or a tunnel or a bridge...
Thank you.
No... I am looking for the Eiffel Tower.
And where are we?
Nothing has occurred recently to shake my confidence.
I'm glad I saw it before becoming extinct.
He takes good care of that.
I will start with you.
Keeping my body fit, keeping my mind alert, keeping my landlord appeased. That's a full-time job.
Thank you.
You are bringing in wrong values. Love is a romantic designation for a most ordinary biological, or shall we say chemical, process. A lot of nonsense is talked and written about it.
You're the most improbable creature I've ever met in my life, Ninotchka, Ninotchka...
A Polish lancer. I was sixteen.
Ninotchka, or shall I say Special Envoy Yakushova...
I have a better suggestion. Let's forget that the telephone ever rang. I never heard that you are Yakushova... you are Ninotchka... my Ninotchka...
Tonight let's not represent anybody but ourselves.
You know I want to...
What are you after?
But you have now, and I know now that you are a man who employs business methods which in Russia would be punished by death.
At anything. At the whole ludicrous spectacle of life. At people being pompous and taking themselves seriously and exaggerating their own importance. If you can't find anything else to laugh at you can laugh at you and me.
That's not a laugh! I mean a laugh from the heart. Now let's see. I'm going to tell you a funny story. Just a moment... I've got it! Well, it seems there were a couple of Frenchmen who went to America...
No... go on.
And General Savitzky.
No, darling. I'll tell you another story, a much better one.  The only thing that will be over on Thursday is the lawsuit. There will be no Thursday for us. Not next week or any week. We won't let it happen. I'll tear it out of the calendar. Is that a good story?
To the loveliest story I ever heard.
They are all Duchesses here... thousands of Duchesses... and I am going to tell them.
No. Nobody will find us.
No! No!
Much happier.
If you don't stay with me, I'll have to continue my fight. I'll travel wherever Russian commissions are. I'll turn them all into Buljanoffs, Iranoffs, and Kopalskis. The world will be crowded with Russian restaurants. I'll depopulate Russia. Once you saved your country by going back. This time you can save it by staying here.
Your conversation has one marvelous advantage, Swana. However many questions you ask you never expect an answer.
Darling, I was busy looking out for your interests.
Sweetheart, we won't have to bother about our future if you are willing to raffle off your past!
Imagine two million clerks and shop girls peeking into my life for a sou! Think of my lovely life being wrapped around cheese and blood sausages! I can see a big grease spot in the midst of my most intimate moments!
Darling, you're taking my business affairs far too seriously. Much as I'd love to rob the Bolsheviks of their filthy money, I won't do it at the expense of your health. Particularly as we know we won't get much.  You look so pale... pale but interesting.
Well... er... I caught a glimpse of her when she walked through the lobby.
Timeless. When she comes into a room you'd think that the Bolsheviks had taken over Paris. She wears her cheap miserable blouse as though it were the latest model by Schiaparelli. What a woman! What a woman! There is a Russian snowstorm in each of her eyes.
Yes, Swana.
Not at all. Your Highness, may I present Madame Yakushova?
No... please...
All right, I'll listen.
Say it over and over again, Leon. Words are a wonderful safety valve, and that's what you need -- because you know it's impossible, don't you?
That does it, Swana.  Now you mustn't miss your appointment with your hair-dresser.
Thank you, Swana. You are very gracious.
I am willing to hand over the jewels and sign the necessary papers if you take that five-forty plane to Moscow.
Why?
Yes, it does.
You want me to go to Constantinople?
Please don't waste my time, Comrade. Do your duty. Good-by.
The future of the common people.
Where is it?
Your Highness, forgive this intrusion, but...
Never.  I never said that about Jews!
We'll see about that ...
Yeah?  Well, I own the fucking casino.
Son of a bitch.
Pay him.  Pay him what he wants.
Uh, I would say these people are going to cost a million dollars over the next two years ...
Uh huh ...
No, we have nothing to hide.
To protect his people.
You do it.
You think this is just about politics?
No!  Magruder!  That sonofabitch tests my Quaker patience to the breaking point.
Sure.  Lyndon, JFK, FDR -- I mean, Truman cut the shit out of my investigation of Hiss back in '48.
He wants money.
Pay him.
Uh, we've never done this before, sir ... How do we pay?  In ... hundreds?  Do you fill a black bag full of unmarked bills?
No ... I can do this because I've spent my whole career building anti Communist credentials.
Looks like he talked to Joe Kraft ... and to the Times.  Told them he was dead set against the bombing, that you were ... "unstable."  Claims he has to handle you "with kid gloves" ...
No, no.  He's our only "star" right now.  He'd go crying straight to the press.  He'd crucify us -- the sonofabitch!  Get someone from our staff on his ass. Tap his phones.  I want to know everyone he talks to.
I trusted Mitchell.  It was that damn big mouth wife of his.
You've never been a greater example to the country than you are now, sir, but ... but you need to get out more, sir, and talk to the people.  No one I know feels ... close to you.
Cox!  Fire him.
Sir, the deadline is today.
Three days before, on the June twentieth tape -- the one with the eighteen-minute gap --
It's gone.  No one will ever find out what's on it.
I did?
All right.
Because the President says it is.  My job is to protect this country from its enemies, and its enemies are inside the walls.
I'll talk to Helms.  Oh, Pat asked if you're coming to the Residence for dinner tonight.
What?  That he knew Johnny Roselli? Hoover knew a lot of gangsters.
No ... a little deficit won't hurt. Jesus, they're serious.  Why're we stopping?
... beating out the other papers, chasing girls ...
Then this shall be our little secret.  Remember that I see into thy soul as God sees.  Thou may fool the world. Even thy father.  But not me, Richard. Never me.
What about happiness, Mother?
What ... ?
Firing you, Mr. Helms, wouldn't do any good.  Of course you'll continue as DCI.  You're doing a magnificent job.
Not if you have spies in the White House, it isn't your job.
Black Irishman.  Very moving. "Turning and turning in the widening gyre / The falcon cannot hear the falconer / Things fall apart, the center cannot hold / Mere anarchy is loosed upon the world / And everywhere the ceremony of innocence is drowned / The best lack all conviction, while the worst are full of passionate intensity" ... But it ends so beautifully ominous -- "What rough beast, its hours come round at last / Slouches toward Bethlehem to be born?" ... Yes, this country stands at such a juncture.
Not Joaquin, you idiot.  Nixon.  Did you hear what he said in Oregon? About me having too much power.
It's between Nixon and a Kennedy again, Edgar ... Who do you want?
Actually, I've just had a bit of luck.
The old queen did it on purpose.
Kissinger?
I always get my man.
The White House.
Dogs ... Season starts tomorrow.  It keeps me calm.  I don't like going back into the same building four times.
Remember -- listen up!  Fire team discipline is there at all times. Keep your radios on at all times during the entire penetration.  Check yourselves.  Phony ID's, no wallets, no keys.  We rendezvous where?  The Watergate, Room 214.  When?  At zero three-hundred.
Nobody's gonna beat Kennedy in '64 with all the money in the world.
Well, you sure been chock full of surprises so far, "Mister President."
Here, Tim ... Tim.  I'm as frustrated as you, Henry, but don't you think this one's a Democrat problem.  They started the war; it makes them look bad.
I didn't ask what your staff thinks, Henry.  What do you think?
No one understands! -- even my own men.  What do you think the Communists respond to?  Honesty, liberal guilt, soul-wringing crap, fathers on TV crying?  Hell no!  I understand the Communist mind, I've studied it for thirty years.  They grasp "realpolitik" better than any of us, right, Henry?
Exactly, yes, Mr. President.  That is my contention.
But it must be done; your government is paralyzed.
All kinds of shit would come out. Like the Ellsberg thing.  You knew about that, Henry, didn't you?
Oh God, I'm going to throw up.
You don't think he was a hero?
How did he do that?  All those kids ... Why do they hate me so much?
That has the added virtue of being true.
What the hell -- I love her.  And she's great in bed.
Don't worry -- I'll use the old Nixon charm on her.
You're doing the right thing, Dick ... don't let 'em shake you.
It broke my heart when Harold died.
What kind of, uh ... music do you like?
Oh yeah, he's good.
Proud?
It is.  We know that.  And it's enough that we know.  Just think of the girls.  They're still young.  We never see them.  I lost my parents.  I don't want them to lose theirs; I don't want them to grow up without a mother and father ...
You don't have to go.
And then you'll be happy?
Will you ... would you kiss me?
Why don't we go down to Key Biscayne together?  Just the two of us.
Because ... I have to relax.
I was thinking tonight -- do you remember, Dick?  Do you remember when you used to drive me on dates with the other boys?  You didn't want to let me out of your sight.
No, you're not.  So stop comparing yourself to him.  You have no reason to ... You have everything you ever wanted. You've earned it.  Why can't you just enjoy it?
I do.  I do.  In my own way.
They're all your enemies?
But they never will, Dick.  No matter how many elections you win, they never will.
Well enough.  You're looking "happy," Nelson.
Lost.
The "crises"?
Who else'd be in your truck.
'Predate it.
I don't know. Nothin'. Wouldn't be no point to it.
All the time you spend tryin' to get back what's been took from you there's more goin' out the door. After a while you just try and get a tourniquet on it.
How come're you doin that?
You can't stop what's comin. Ain't all waitin' on you.
He is just a goddamn homicidal lunatic, Ed Tom.
Nothin'?
He won't neither. He never has.
I don't know. My mind wanders.
Yeah, right. Sheriff, can you give me your word on somethin'?
Llewelyn would never ask for help. He never thinks he needs any.
Llewelyn Moss?
I don't know. Oh.
He's goin' back out there and he wanted to know if you wanted to go with him.
We dedicate ourselves daily anew. Something like that.
I think I'm goin' to commence dedicatin' myself twice daily. It may come to three times before it's over...
Your husband had the opportunity to remove you from harm's way. Instead, he used you to try to save himself.
Not like that. Not like you say.
Fine. I don't wanna know. I don't even wanna know where you been all day.
That'll work.
Well -- how come?
Yes ma'am?
What did you tell him?
What's that.
You go to hell.
Sir I ain't at liberty to give out no information about our residents.
Step out of the car please, sir.
Well -- where ya goin'?
It doesn't make any difference where she is.
I was just passin' the time.
I could come back then.
You've lived here all your life?
We lived in Temple Texas for many years. Raised a family there. In Temple. We come out here about four years ago.
Sir?
Call it?
For what?
Nineteen fifty-eight. It's been traveling twenty-two years to get here. And now it's here. And it's either heads or tails, and you have to say. Call it.
Sir?
Yessir, be here til ten tomorrow morning.
How well do you know Chigurh.
Yes?
I'm sorry.
That's got two double beds.
Lookin' for what's comin'.
Not that way.
I don't mean braze.
What did I say?
Then I ask you again how you come to be out here with no clothes.
Don't jack with me.
Nam?
Well, you should find out. She keeps talking about them...
IF THIS IS ABOUT DEL, FORGET IT! I'M NOT COMING BACK!
They're just eggs, Elden, how embarrassing can eggs be?
Who eats eggs for lunch, anyhow?
No, it's nothing, I... my piranha just mauled me a little when I layed their food out.
No, Elden, I need to...
Bad idea...
...and half the other guys in this town. Including you, I believe...
So you're saying Betty Sizemore -- our Betty Sizemore -- who you were in swing choir with -- has now hired somebody to scalp her husband in her own kitchen while she watched? You're amazing.
Ah, shit... Do I have to hear this now?
She said she was in Arizona, did she?
What about it?
I'm not going out there! Let's wait for the real police...
You gotta go, we're pinned down!
I've got a pretty good idea. You're here to kill me, so kill me. You want me to be afraid, but I'm not. I don't care who you are, or why you two killed my husband...
I have no idea what he was mixed up in... it was always something.
Wait. Let me get this out.  I like the symphony, walks in the rain, sunsets, animals and children. I read passionately, and I like to discuss things. I'm basically conservative, but flexible. I've been involved in the death of thirty- two people, but I can live with that because the world is lighter by thirty- two pieces of shit, excuse my language.
I know. I borrowed it from your grandparents because I... I... it doesn't matter. Don't worry, they're fine...  Look, I used to feel that same way, said practically those same words, sitting at night in a foxhole in Korea...  I've chased you across the country, Betty, and I come to find out we're a lot more alike than you'd think.
This is really awkward...
Well, you are.
What are you talking about?
I gotta go.
Alright, okay... I think you broke the record for staying in character about three hours ago.
Wow... You just gave me goosebumps, you know that? You make it all sound so real. Great improv...
I know. Listen, we need to take a time out here. Can we talk seriously for a minute?
Well, I just feel that life'll be much sweeter for you now with me around. I promise...
What do you mean? What did I do to you...
...What? What did you call me? George... McCord. You're my favorite actor on...
No, I... I'll leave. Forgive me if I caused you all any trouble... I just, I don't know how I...  ...I'm sorry.
Mmm-hmm. Listen, I forgive you, Mr. McCord...
George...
I told you. Sue Ann was gonna take me out tonight, but...
All right, then. Actually, I'm glad you're going out. I got something going on tonight. Some serious clients, with real potential.
They're new to us...
I came for love...
I don't know.
Oh, appreciate it. I was trying to, ahh, give a sense of history to...
I'm great, good, content.  What happened to your arm, Roy?
Well, I was worried about you and I wanted to make sure you were alright... and I guess I was sort of hoping I could ask you about what happened...
You're in serious danger!
Wait, I thought you said you'd never been outta Kansas...
No. Loma Vista.
...did I win some contest?
LISTEN TO ME! IF I DON'T DO THIS, HE'S DEAD!
Yeah, well, at least fish don't use your razor or pee on the seat...
Ummm... no, no. Different 'Ravell.'
What are you talking about? This bar is packed with professional people!  Everybody says if you're going to get married, this is the spot to meet someone... Luckily, I'm currently off men, so I've got the luxury of not giving a shit.
God, that's awful!
It may not have been an accident. They never did find her head...
Her 'head'?! You're making this up...
No, no! Well, see, she was having an affair with a Russian diplomat who I believe was mixed up with the Mafia...
ON TELEVISION!!  Cut the shit, will you!
HE IS REAL!!
Oh, God! You scared me! Yes...
You still in love?
Yes. I'd never been in a place like that before.
I have to leave now.
You're a hundred percent right. They rely on what's-his-name's arm too much...
Oh, yes, with the coffee...
Are we gonna do business here, or not?
I... I don't know...
Well, my idea of stupid is very different from yours.  So here's how this is gonna work. Would you take your socks off, please?
My socks?
That's what I thought.  You better give me another example.
That was to get him to talk!  Get rid of that thing, will you?
What 'look'?
I wasn't done, I was just sick of hearing him whine. And you didn't take him out, you scalped him. Christ, I almost puked, did I tell you that?
I'm a Yankee, myself. Massachusetts.
Well, no one ever spit in my face before. Especially some cracker fuck.
...among others.
Yeah, well, if the wife's trying to sell it she'll fuck up. She's an amateur, just like Del was.
No.
What?
I'm not telling 'til you straighten up. You been acting like fucking Jerry Lewis on me and this shit's gotta stop or you can forget about your Betty... I mean it.
That's good. You're learning. But let me tell you why I know she was lying.  First off, Betty would never fall for a soap star. It's beneath her.
No, no, Betty came here strictly for business, 'cause it's the biggest market for what she's selling. I should have known it all along. I'm kicking myself as I shave here. So, first thing we...
What doesn't?
No, you believed her, we drove all the way to L.A. so that means you trusted her that much... so why's the rest of her story suddenly so kooky? Huh?
Leave. Take this shit back to Detroit and get the rest of our money.
It's to follow my instincts. And my instincts say get the fuck out of Dodge.
No, I said to follow 'my' instincts. Now, we go up there and conclude our business. Case closed.
Betty was a lovely child.
...who doesn't?
Yeah, bring your friend along. I'm sure you got a lot of catching up to do...
I'll tell the cast ahead of time. What do you say?
No! Let me try this!
What about me? Don't you wanna know how I feel about it? I'm the one who...
What are you talking about? Killing's totally natural. It's dying that isn't natural...
Yeah. Why, you know him?
Betty. It's O.K. except I'm worn out. We spent all weekend looking for her doctor-boy. How can a big time heart guy leave no trace of himself?
So tell her to settle for the old one in Orange County.
She's gonna have to 'cause I'm out of ideas.
God, that sounds so familiar. Ravell, Ravell... where's he out of?
Once again we find ourselves in agreement.  What kind of work do you do, Big Dan?
You mis'able little sneak thief...
That's not the issue, Delmar. Even if it did put you square with the Lord, the State of Mississippi is more hardnosed.
I left my pomade in that car! Maybe I can creep up!
Well ya know, Delmar, they say that with a thrill-seekin' personality, what goes up must come down. Top of the world one minute, haunted by megrims the next. Yep, it's like our friend George is a alley cat and his own damn humors're swingin' him by the tail. But don't worry, Delmar; he'll be back on top again. I don't think we've heard the last of George Nelson.
Oh sweet Lord, Everett, looka this!
Caintcha see it Everett! Them sigh- reens did this to Pete! They loved him up an' turned him into a horney- toad!
Course it's Pete! Look at 'im!
He was never turned into a frog!
Honey, it's just - Shutup, Delmar - it's just -
Aw, don't be ignorant, Delmar. I told you they was gonna flood this valley.
Campaign manager? Waldrip.
Well, that's how I characterize it.
Enticements a power, wealth, settera.
That's right, honey.
Pete, the personal rancor reflected in that remark I don't intend to dignify with comment, but I would like to address your general attitude of hopeless negativism. Consider the lilies a the goddamn field, or-hell!- take a look at Delmar here as your paradigm a hope.
...I believe, unless I'm very much mistaken - see, we've been away for several years, uh...
...With my added time for the escape, I don't get out now 'til 1987... I'll be eighty-four years old.
Nearest Ford auto man's Bristol.
Well that all depends. You boys do Negro songs?
Oh mercy, yes. You gotta beat that competition.
Buyin' nipples!
You were out at sea! Hey, guess what? I graduated. I got my degree.
Yeah, I sort of thought so myself.
That what she was... a Norfolk Deb?
What did you call her? What did I hear you call her, you son of a bitch?
Yes, Joe.
I'm doing okay, sir.
Sir, this officer candidate requests permission to speak to you in private.
It's important, sir!
Before that.
No, sir.
Only two things come out of Oklahoma, steers and queers. Which one are you, boy? I don't see any horns so you must be a queer.
No, sir.
Zack, don't!
Yes, sir!
What difference does it make? If anything was to happen, which I'm sure it isn't, it would be my responsibility.
What do you care? Suppose I was pregnant. Just suppose it. You don't think I'd try to make you do anything you don't want to, do you?
Forget that. Come on. Got a little surprise...
What?
Lynette, watch your mouth! Somebody might overhear.
I got my foot on the floor.
What do you mean?
Well, excuse me for livin'!
Polish. What kind of name is Mayo?
To meet interesting people, improve myself. You wouldn't believe the losers we got over in Port Angeles.
No. I work for National Paper. It's a good job. I make eight-twenty-three an hour.  When I get enough money saved, I plan to go on to college.
Be a friend. Leave.
The thing that really got to me... she didn't leave a note. Nothing. I've always hated her for that.
For a start, I wouldn't marry a man I wasn't in love with.
Sure.  Zack, I hope you know I didn't have to show you that picture.
Naw.
No problem, but who's Susan?
Do you know that for sure?
Zack, it wasn't him! He didn't ask me to D.O.R. I came to him on my own.  I'm glad it's over, Zack. I really mean that. He was right. I wasn't doing this for me.
A woman and a little girl, both asleep upstairs.
Peace out.
She didn't.
There is not one thing funny here.
Fuckin' asshole, thinks he knows me. Drives his German car up to 125th Street a couple of times, buys a few rounds, thinks he's a tough guy, thinks he knows me.  You don't know one thing about me!
You got till the count of three. Then you end up like him.
She better.
You finish.  Then we finish.
They're not supposed to be here!
Daddy's not coming back, she's in the middle of a divorce, it's just the two of them.  We're okay, here.  We can do this, right?
She'll call the cops, they'll be here before I get unpacked.
What tables?  I've never seen him before.
Pure idiot.
When you said you'd let 'em go I thought she'd come running right out for sure.
Okay, fuckball, you think.  What are we gonna do?
Nobody is gonna die, man, will you please have the balls to follow through with a good idea?  Think about it, what would you do if you were them, stay in there and choke to death, or come out?!  Huh?  We're just getting them to come out for forty-five minutes, forty-five fucking minutes!  The worst that's gonna happen is they pass out, we drag 'em out here into the fresh air, and they'll be fine.
Hey.
Huh?
Can we come in?
Oh, that phone call...
I said open the door.
It's just the woman and the kid?
How many more do we have after this?
No, Edgar Allen.
Open the door.
0150.
Wait.
Give me a break.
Uh uh.
He'll know we're in trouble.  He heard me, I said "There are three..."
He won't even know who it was.
I'm dizzy, not deaf.
Huh uh.
Okay.
But nothing, we want full fledged membership in the Black Panther Party... and none of this "Okay sugah as long as you stay in the background washing my socks and rubbing my feet" bullshit either!
I have confirmed to you my address, that's all I'm required to by law to do. We have broken no law.
That's just it Huey. The pigs don't know how many Panthers there are. Both of us show and they might start putting 2 and 2 together. We're not even two hundred strong yet... but we got 'em guessing thousands.
They are carrying guns. They are threatening police officers. They are undermining the United States of America. And you Inspector Brimmer are not taking your duties seriously...
Shit man. It was... you know spontaneous.
Shut up. Just shut the fuck up.
No man. PE -- "political education."
Hmmm. As you know the Bureau -- and Mr. Hoover -- is particularly "sensitive" to anything that might agitate or solidify the coloreds on the left.
No I'm not. I'd like to say, frankly and off the record, that I resent the Bureau's presence here. "Advisory Basis" or not. And, once we get these boys put away and the Panthers permanently discredited, I'd appreciate it if you'd leave us to take care of our own. Now I'm finished.
Jesus...
Cut the crap, you've been taking the man's money for years. Now it's time you earned it.
The time, my friend, is what Sartre called, "the moment the match is being put to the fuse." Question is, is the hand holding that match gonna be black or white.
And did you witness the shoot-out?
You mean...
Yeah... but it seems they're bringing Malcolm's widow Betty Shabazz to town, to speak at a rally, do an interview for Ramparts.  And they want us to help with security.
So talk...
Get the brothers a beer. Me too while you're at it.  Men? Well we can spare six for security...
Yeah... I guess. Any of other Panthers know about this?
But nothing... you do live here don't you?
He had a feeling you'd be coming by.
All of the above, man...  And then some.
You don't even know it man, but you're a god damn hero.
Yeah... cop hit me...
Lord, never thought I'd live to see my boy in prison.
That would be nice.
That would be nice, too.
He's my father.
Don't fault him for having grown up on the frontier.  It was a harder time and a harder place than you know.
Yes, sir.
What unit?
Who cared for your wounds?
Apology accepted.
Colonel will do.
As you wish.
Oh?
You have eighteen of my men.  I want them back.
Is that so?
Yes...  ... father.
Father?
We're low on salt.  I should go to Pembroke and get some.
That's right.
Those of us who call ourselves Patriots are not seeking to give birth to an American nation, but to protect one that already exists.  It was born a hundred-and-seventy years ago at Jamestown, Virginia and has grown stronger and more mature with every generation reared and with every crop sown and harvested.  We are a nation and our rights as citizens of that nation are threatened by a tyrant three thousand miles away.
Thank you.  Were I an orator, those are the exact words I would have spoken.
I was an American, I just didn't know it yet...
You said bribery twice...
Gabriel.
I'm sorry.
I begged him to stay in the cover of the trees but he insisted the only way to break Cornwallis was muzzle- to-muzzle.  He spent too many years in the British army.
I am, I think.
The bigger problem is where, not when.  The French fleet won't sail north of the Chesapeake for fear of early storms.
You expect Cornwallis to be held here by militia?
Not held, just slowed down.
Goodbye, Harry.
You may, of course, keep your weapons, but I must warn you that...
No, there'll be skirmishers on the roads.  We're safer here.
And what is the second thing?
But it's already been two years and that's two more years.  The war could be over by then.
Six-pounders.  Lots of them.
It's a place where the dead speak, Missy.
Lovey...Church might be still alive when you're in a high school...and that's a very long time.
Missy Dandridge. And she says it's a operation!
Well, it's actually reincarnation, but you get the idea. And some people think we just wink out...like a candle flame when the wind blows hard.
You believe in it.
Because your mother and I need the rest, sugar. Now buzz.
I'm Rachel. Thanks again for saving the wandering minstrel boy, here.
Aw, you'll be okay. Less than a mile.
Ellie will, though. She'll suffer plenty.
Maybe when they call I'll just tell Ellie I haven't seen the damn cat around. You know?
It's going to be dark before we even get where we're going, Louis. But we can do it...and we're going to.
Nothing.  Do we plant him on the outer circle or start a new one?
We're still not where we're going.
The place we're going is on the other side of that.
Your cairn.
No buts! Accept what's done, Louis. What we done was right. Another time it might not be, but tonight it was... at least I hope to Christ it was. Now you make your call...but not a word about tonight.
What did we do, Jud?
No...squatting out there at the Holiday Inn like a couple of vultures. He really thinks Rachel's going to go back with them. Her and Ellie.
Louis--
The power of this place is old and always restless. Sometimes the dead do more than speak. Remember, doc.
Remember.
You don't understand--
Don't talk like an asshole even if you are just a bit of underdone potato or a blot of mustard.
I know what you just said. Ellie, clear your place.
I thought maybe you did. I know you don't approve of the subject being raised--
You can't.  I can.
Simple.  I have something you won't more than anything.  The way to free you from the curse of the treasure.  You have something I want -- more than anything.
Wait as long as you like.
I'll watch my back.
All right then.
No.  But him I believe.  He us genuinely angry.
Very well.
Did you, now?
Then why aren't you eating?
I know where your heart truly lies.
Well, I am not going to stay hidden in some cabin, or I suppose it's going to be heaving bosoms and bare for the remainder of the voyage!
If I had known --
-- then we never would have met.
I guess you can never truly know someone else's heart.
It doesn't!
Don't be thinking I'm not already working on it.
Welcome to the Caribbean, love.
Well, perhaps ... with a bit more to drink, I might ...
Exactly.
First -- have you found me a crew?
Oh, there's a hard tale, Jack. Most of the decent pirates in town won't sail with you -- seem to think you're a jinx.
Now where, I wonder, would they have gotten that idea?
A fool's errand.
Ah, that's a dark and unpleasant tale, best left untold.
Ah -- he's learned, then.  Plays things more close to the vest. See, Jack was a cartographer, back in Old England.  Somehow he came by the money to commission the Pearl. Hired himself a crew, promised each man an equal share.  So, they're forty days out, and the First Mate says, everything's an equal share, that should mean the location of the island, too.  So Jack gave up the bearings.  That night, there was a mutiny.
The wind is quarter from astern ... by the time we're underway, we'll never catch them.
We need only to come about, to put them in range of the long nines.
Sorry, I didn't know.
This must be some important boat.
Ah, but you have heard of me.
Funny, I was thinking along those lines.  How about you let me go in alone, and while you're setting up an ambush, I'll trick the pirates out to you.
Nothing I wouldn't be please to be rid of.
Pirate.
And you want to turn pirate yourself?
Never.  They took Miss Swann.
I haven't set foot off dry land since I was twelve, when the ship I was on exploded.  It's been a sound policy.
Good man.  Good pirate.  And clever -- I never met anyone with as clever a mind and hands as him. When you were puzzling out that cell door, it was like seeing his twin.
Figured you wouldn't want to hear it.
Sure -- because he could always go pirating.
Oh -- did I forget to mention that?
On what?
The Black Pearl is a real ship.
Yes, I have.
No.
Dammit, man, it appears someone is stealing your ship!
Yeah, I'm going to finish what you started --
That's right.  And making me was the biggest mistake you ever made!
Don't be a child, Icarus.  She is just another scientist and like all scientists, she doesn't care about anything outside the world of the laboratory.
But, Poppy, you don't know what this means --
You're right.  Place a call to our friends at the network and to Mr. Joplin at the E.P.A.
Icarus, please!  This is important!
Then you still love me?
If you loved me like I loved you?
Did I?  I've been waiting for that for years.
Not that.
Then perhaps we can use liquid nitrogen to keep the meltdown under control.
Wait, wait, can I at least have his body?
Yeah, I do!
Why don't you just shove it up your ass!  Haw-haw!
What are you going to do?  Make me throw it out?
Aaabout...?
What did he want?
That's right.  C.D.C. found out and closed them down...
They'll in validate the key. Probably nothing.
You're looking for a urine sample.
Susan, Dr. Argon is giving you an opportunity here.
Of course he is, but at least there isn't a security guard outside my door.
You're afraid of him.
So, I guess it worked.
Same old Daniel.
I've read they're using it to repair cancer cells.
Sure.  Can I ask you one more thing? You haven't published anything in a while.  How come?
I don't know.
It escaped from the lab before we could finish the experiment.
Yes.
Then you must have at some point tried to reverse the procedure.
Once the subject was polymerized we were unable to reassemble the original organic structure.
Got it.
No, why?
Blame the victim.
This is what I deserve for trying to protect the world from a madman and his mercenary physicists?
You're not protecting the world, you're obstructing progress!
I'm glad you came to me for help.
I can't go back to jail.  I gotta get out of here.
What could happen?  I'm the plastic man, remember?
Where is it?
Argon's private lab.
I'm not leaving without you, Susan!
We don't have time to argue, Susan.
Do the words 'hero fantasies' mean anything to you?  How about 'infantile dementia'?
I get it.  You're the goon fetch boy.  The zookeeper Argon calls in when one of his guinea pigs gets loose.
'Paranoia is what separates the secured from the unsecured.'
Exactly.
I think you should, Miss Gallagher.
Well, I tell you, yesterday when I was here, I had one of your books in my hand, and when I got outside, I realized I still had your book in my hand. So as long as I had your book in my hand, I thought I might as well take it home and read it. This morning, I got up and put your book in my hand, and here's your book in your hand.
Your mother will want to kiss me? Give me back my letters.  That's the breaks I get. It's the mothers that are always grateful to me.  Here.
You're a peculiar person. Why the other day I pleaded with you not to send in that story and  
Not if you're going to lose any sleep about it.
My name is Smith - well, that you seem to have been able to stand for the last month. I'm white, male and over twenty-one. I've never been in jail - that is, not often. And I prefer Scotch to Bourbon. I hate carrots, I hate peas, I like black coffee and I hate garters. I make seventy-five bucks a week and I've got eight hundred and forty-seven bucks in the bank - and - I don't know yet whether your eyes are blue or violet.
I'm glad.
Yeah. Oh, it's great. Of course it doesn't compare with this coliseum of yours here, but 'twill serve m'lady, 'twill serve.  The architecture has a little feeling of Missouri Gothic - and the furniture sort of leans toward Oklahoma Renaissance - with a tiny touch of Grand Rapids.
Oh, Mother will give us the blue room. You haven't a red room, have you?  Well, bless her heart. Wouldn't that be nice! My, oh my - six rooms and two baths and a blue room. I guess she would let us have the right wing if we needed it, wouldn't she?
Oh no. No, no. Not me. I haven't worn these things for Years.
Oh, no I won't my dear - oh, no I won't my dear - I'll wash behind my ears, but no I won't my dear!
I'll tell you what. Let's you and me sneak out all by ourselves
Unreasonable!  Have you any idea what the place looks like downstairs? Do you expect me to stand here and see this place turned into a cheap barroom?
That's ridiculous.
You're acting like a child.
Sit down!
Oh, the usual thing. Blah, blah, blah attended the blah, blah reception and wore the same blah, blah things.
You don't have anything to complain about, Mother. He was all right last night, wasn't he? I told you not to worry about him.
Mother!
I'll tell Mr. Smith at once, sir. Have a seat.
Thanks, I will.
Yeah?
Yeah - go on.
Gloria Golden?
What expenses? All you need is carfare to Long Island. You'd better get a shave and a shine, because you, you're going to have a tough time getting in there as it is.
Yes, sir.
Well, it's your business to get news! And here you had a story right in your own lap and you let the Tribune scoop us on it. Making a first class Grade A monkey out of me. If it ever happens again - just don't bother about coming back. That's all.
Aw, you've been reading a lot of cheap tabloids. Anne and myself are going to move downtown in a nice little flat, we're gonna forget all about this social stuff, and we're gonna be known as Mr. and Mrs. Stew Smith. How do you like that?
What play?
'For he's only a bird in a gilded cage, a beautiful sight to see'  Tweet, tweet - ha, ha
Dawson, huh? Was I very drunk last night?
Now I'm sorry. I appreciate your efforts. But I don't need anybody to help me button my pants - I've been buttoning my pants for thirty years all right, and I can button 'em with one hand as a matter of fact.
Thank you.  Where is Mr. Smith?
Say, who's been tying your ties lately? It looks rotten.
Been where?
I don't know a thing about him, but isn't he the one you're always yelling about?
What could I be?
The little O'Brien girl, of course - the one you suggested in the story.
Gallagher, what are you going to do - tell me how to write a play?
There's nothing sudden about that  He's always loved the girl, but he was such a sap he didn't have sense enough to tell her. Well, that's all right - we can fix that. He will go to the little O'Brien girl, and - here, I'll show you.
No breach-of-promise case has been filed. The matter has been settled out of court.
No, I have no idea - unless some of the silver-ware is missing.
I've anticipated it, madame. The bicarbonate is ready.
I have. Double-strength!
Oh, my marriage to Anne. Now Mrs. Schuyler, we don't want you to go to any trouble about that. We just want the usual blessings, that's all.
All right, Grandma
Well sir, to be a putterer, one's mind must be at ease. A person with a problem could never be a putterer. For instance, sir, a fish can putter in water but not on land because he'd be out of place. An eagle can putter around a rugged mountaintop but not in a cage, because he'd be restless and unhappy. Now sir, if you will pardon me, with all due respect, sir, as a Smythe to a Smith, you are an eagle in a cage.
That's all I wanted to know!
In my handbag.
Sure.
I love you too.
I'm sorry ...
She's crying.
I don't know.
I got caught in the storm. You were gone all night too.
No I'm not.
Um ... It's ...
Well, sometimes talking's over-rated. Don't you think?
To be honest Mary Sue. I didn't think you'd want to come here until we'd been pinned for a little while.
I think ... I might be ill ...
You want to ask her out tonight, right? And then you want to give her your school pin ...
Gee whizz, Bud. Guess I'll just have the usual. Cheeseburger and a cherry coke.
No. What?
Um ... Yes I do. Where's our lawyer?
Well I don't think it's a circus. And I don't think they do either.
No it isn't.
Look it doesn't matter. It's not important.
Oh yeah. A Buick. It's swell.
No, not that hedge. The other one.
The one in your mind. The one that you see on a bright cold morning. The one that you see when you walk in front of your house and you just stand there and stare.
I don't know.
To who?
I looked in the library. They got covers with nothing inside them.
So what's the point?
Just go with the program--hunh? I'm late for work.
Gee whiz "Bud", what could we possibly need when we have each other?
Well maybe it needs to be messed with. Did that ever like--occur to you?  You know, they don't want to be like this, it's just that nobody ever helped them before.
David, nobody's happy in a Poodle skirt and a sweater set.  You like all this don't you?
Sure.
Seemed kinda sexy. Look. I read 35 pages.
That's great.
No. She really liked you.
What?
I told you. I'm like positive.
I'm not ready yet. I gotta do this for a little while.
Right here.
Well--it all just keeps going. Roads ... rivers ...
They just grow like that?
It was a prop for the school play ...
No I won't. I swear.
No. McIntire's. Remember:  "For the very best in men's attire, Head right down to McIntire's."
But you don't know how long I've been looking for someone like you.
I can't.
What?
Oh. You're a smart little bastard aren't you?  It's kind of like a restricted ticket. You gotta leave the same way you came.
This is TV pal. They don't fool around.
Yeah ...
Look. I thought we talked about this, I thought we said ...
Oh--what's the point, Bud?
Oh ... Okay.  ... But I really liked it.
Hi.
That's not the reason. I've got a date at six thirty.
You just fucking said "chat," that is so -- what are you now? "chat." I'm just calling to make sure you show up at this party tonight.
Yes, I'll be there.
This is "Fly With Us?"
Ok. Thank you.
I know.
I'm not, I'm very happy.
I'm sorry.
I didn't ask him that. He's lying.
I have no idea.
I just want to know where she's staying.
Nothing, huh, do you know what I'm doing?
Georgia.
Not very late.
You're going to work now?
Yes.
This is really weird and really embarrassing for me but....uh....  I was wondering if you could help me out with a little bit of money.
Yes, no, yes. I can't. I can't afford that. I'm sorry. Sorry.
I don't know.
Maybe I'll see you later, when I pick up my car?
Hi.
Yes I do.
Yeah, not really.
Yes. LENA Elizabeth has a picture of you guys -- your sisters and you, it's a lot of family, it must be nice.
That must be nice. That must be really, really, really great.
Sure.
That's insane. That is really, really crazy. That's just crazy if you spend three thousand dollars on pudding.
I'm sorry. I thought you said --
No I didn't say that.
My friend Carlos is doing it who works with me. It's his. It's his pudding, he's doing it. It's not mine. He's crazy. I told him not to do it. He's the one who's insane. He only spent about one hundred dollars so far though --
What happened?
What?
Yeah.
I don't know.
This is Lena.
So what do I do then?
Yeah.
I don't freak out very often.
...I don't know what you mean....
Thank you.
Ok. Where are you from originally?
This really looks like Hawaii here.
Yeah.
Yes I'm sorry.
Did you have my home phone number?
Ok.
I didn't do it.
Can I have your credit card number, followed by the expiration date?
.....1274 Moorpark. Sherman Oaks, California. #4. 91403.
And your name?
It's just for verification through the credit card company.
No one will know your name.
That's that.
How's business?
Business is very food, thanks. ELIZABETH What's very food?
It takes that much time to process the order and make sure it's valid --
Why you wearin' a suit?
WHICH?
Wow, you're goin' to Hawaii, that's great -- you're goin -- ?
Well....what do you want, then?
Yes I am.
What are you doing?
I'm just talking on the phone to you and standing.
I'm serious.
Seriously.
I'll see you there.
Yes, yes, right.
As soon as you want.
David, Don't. Just. Seriously. It doesn't make sense if you think about it in a fair deal like sense. Ok? It's business. Seriously. One hundred dollars for two days work is a lot more than your family is making sitting around your house. I'm serious now. Ok. Please. Now. Just stop.
Put him through.
It's fine.
Sorry.
Ok. What should I do about Eric?
So...did my brother call you?
They've the satisfaction only a hard day's labor can provide.
I'm no longer a man! I awoke to discover I'd turned into a sparrow!
Now give the signal.
"...a poker... he took a poker from the fire..."
Not now, or we're both done for.
But why must you indulge in his pornography?
I don't take my orders from you; not anymore.
Enough to discern its tenor.
It's that Doctor fellow, isn't it? He's come to usurp your place here, hasn't he?
Fuck 'em! They're half-wits and pinheads. Let 'em die on the streets, as Nature intended.
You among them?
Honestly! You cut me to the core! What's the point of all your valiant attempts at rehabilitation if -- when I finally succumb -- when at long last, I pledge myself to righteous conduct -- you regard me with nothing but suspicion? Have you no faith in your own medicine?
Whores and pederasts? You're better off without them.
And my chaise -- am I being denied the privilege of sitting -- of plopping down my ass --
A night spent with the partner of my choice.
I know, because I felt it myself --
Why was it you never took her by force?
Was it impotence?
NEVER!
I'll need an office on the grounds; someplace to store my things.
Playing dress-up with cretins? That sounds like a symptom of madness; not its cure.
A man of his notoriety? He wouldn't last a day on the streets without capture.
It's essential to his recovery; a purgative for the toxins in his mind.
Charenton is my life's work. To have her wrested from beneath me now --
This child let loose the beast from its cage --
How is the patient faring?
And you? It must've been an ordeal.
I don't seek popularity or renown, Monsieur Delben. Mine is a higher mission.
Such gallantry in men is -- sadly -- a rarity; How lucky I am to receive his charity!
And then -- to prove your truly mine -- I'll plunder you, darling, from behind!
I'll fill every slippery hollow; if you're obliging, then you'll swallow!
Don't start --
Fiendishly so.
They decreed me a savage, and now they have made me one.
A tale more horrible than all the rest combined!
"What shall I ready?" asked Fanchon. "My mouth, my ass or my succulent oyster?"
No. But tell him I would.
I pay his stipend every month, far more dutifully than I should.
That barely covers the cost of his room. There's nary a penny left over for appropriate treatments. Opiates to quell his temper. Restraints to chasten him when he misbehaves.
What a beautiful thought, Marquise.
They've put you up to this, haven't they?
Last week would this be?
Oh, but haven't you heard? I'm the Boy Wonder. I've been a genius since the moment I was born.
We've known each other too long, Orson. Sling the bullshit elsewhere.
Mm.
Elegant words, sir, when you have made your name and your fortune on slander and innuendo and gossip. In your papers you taught the world how to look under every rock. I learned at the knee of the master.
Over at RKO?
Apparently it details the exploits of a publisher like myself. Entirely too much like myself. Do you follow so far?
Yeah
There's no call for that language-
You oughta lay off him -- he is the p-p-president, after all.
This picture--
A million dollars a year on art and st-st-statues and there's nothing to explain?!
I'm not asking you to defend anything. But we're in a pickle and we gotta talk about it.
You are being typically theatrical, Marion. I need the Tribune to--
You don't need it! That's the problem you always think you need everything--
But why? Just so you can show it all off -- just so everyone can see what a b-b-big man you are?!
Thank you, sir. She begins to leave
Huh?
You drink at 10 am, do you?
And Mr. Hearst has authorized me to tell you that you're looking at the most beautiful lawsuit in history if you release this picture. He'll bleed your little studio dry and you can all go on back to New York and do Shakespeare with the Boy Wonder.
But you keep coming up with the same elitist crap - - HEART OF DARKNESS with a million dollar budget?! - - no one wants to see that.
Nope.
Showing life
But with compassion and insight--
Image a man that has shaped his time. A titanic figure of limitless influence. Think about empire. A man with an empire at his feet. A man, like a baron, living in a palace, a glorious palace on a hill, and controlling the permutations of everyone beneath him. Feudal.
Orson. Stop. Just stop
Sorry to disappoint.
They don't have to.
Good?! Good?! Words fail you at last! It's terrific! Now I'll have to do some shaping, of course, and some of the scenes aren't exactly . . . exactly . . .
I don't give a shit about-
Well, at least she's off KANE today
So they're Jews. . .
Herman.
Well, this is a great pleasure. Miss Davies! I just saw that ENCHANTMENT is playing at a the Tivoli, the revival house in Santa Monica. That was a fine picture!
Not one of them today has what you had, Miss Davies. Not one of them.
Get out.
Again
Ah, it's a grand title.
The magazines are one thing -- but Hedda! Why did we have to let her come?!
Then we'll open it in Detroit or Dallas or Kalamazoo for God's sake! We'll show it in goddamn circus tents and--!
Why don't you just have the guts to admit it
It's just that my movie is so-
Relax, George. It's gonna go great. Trust me. Have I ever lied to you?
It was the best, kid
Without me. I'm afraid. I got the axe this morning.
Take apart the fucking camera rig -- we could get a few more inches down and then tilt up--
Yeah, they're good. They're good, Tommy.
No, I can't wait. You know when I wait? When it's important to wait. It's not important to wait for no steak. It's important to wait for Reeves to leave the ring. It ain't important to wait for no steak! I won that fight. So, I stayed in the ring, and that way I made sure everybody knew it. I shoulda knocked him out earlier, sonofabitch.
Yeah, I really cleaned up on him.
Nothing...
You want me to do what?
What are you getting so hot about -- Tommy Como told him to come down here...
I didn't tell them to come. Tommy Como...
Huh?
How many times do I have to hit her? I hit her enough.
Whadda I gotta do, Joey? I knocked him down. What did I do wrong? I don't understand.
You want the title shot or not?
Don't be long. I'm afraid with all these tough guys here.
Sure, I'll keep an eye on her.
Jack, no. I just explained the whole thing to you. It was just between me and Salvy, if it had anything to do with you and Vickie, I woulda told you about it.
Jake, did I ever make you look bad before?
Well, the word is to get a title shot you have to cooperate with the people who control boxing, in New York. And they're saying that you don't cooperate.
Come over here.
Jake...
Jake, you made me promise not to get you excited.
Go 'head. Do it.
I was just...
I'm not interested in him.
Then why'd you say that thing about Tony Janiro?
You're the one who said he was good looking. You think he's good looking 'cause I know you think he's good- looking. I'll smash his face inside out. I'll make him into dog meat. Nobody's gonna think he's good-looking when I get through with him. So you just go ahead and think about who you want.
What do I have to do to get a straight answer around here.
What do I say to him? Call him up on the phone and say, "Joey, I'm sorry about that little trouble we had. How about havin' dinner?" Is that what I say?
Why don't you just call him?
I'm leaving you Jake.
Jake, be careful! What're you doing to the belt?!
Right, the gym.
Namely?
I'll admit it all has a mysterious sound -- but is could mean a number of different things. Murder is the least likely.
Almost everything's been done -- under panic. But this is a thousand to one shot. That man's still sitting around his apartment; he isn't panicked.
Six ayem.
The superintendent met Thorwald coming back. He said Thorwald told him he had just put his wife on the train for the country.
You know, every day for three years I asked myself that same question?
Ever get an answer?
Mrs. Thorwald.
In sections! And one other thing, doubting Tom -- it just occurred to me that all the calls Thorwald made were long distance! If he called his wife the day she left -- after she arrived in Merritsville -- why did she need to send him a postcard saying she'd arrived?
The word is "everything." Now what time does my plane leave Tuesday?
That's more like it. Goodnight, old buddy.
Yeah.
Why should I?
That's a start. I'm at the Brevoort now. I'll be looking for you.
Tell her to bring it back!
She's just not the girl for me.
Probably. But when I do, it'll be to someone who thinks of life as more than a new dress, a lobster dinner, and the latest scandal. I need a woman who'll go anywhere, do anything, and love it.
Baloney! Once it was see somebody, get excited, get married -- Now, it's read books, fence with four syllable words, psychoanalyze each other until you can't tell a petting party from a civil service exam
I was.
And some man will lose his.
Now what could he sell at three in the morning?
I have a feeling we've just begun.
No -- but it makes the rest easy to take. And she's reading the Bible.
Thirty-three here. Totals one-ninety. Not enough.
I got twenty or so in my purse. Give me what you've got.
When those cops get a look at Miss Fremont -- they'll even contribute.
Mrs. Doyle?
Yes.
You haven't even heard from him?
Anything else bothering you?
Now that's no way to spend your hard- earned money!
How could I run it from say -- Pakistan?
That's what I'm afraid of.  Could you see me -- driving down to the fashion salon in a jeep -- wearing combat boots and a three day beard? 
Some people can. Now if you'll let me explain --
Three.
Your mind is. And when I want a man, I want all of him.
I have one now.
Why would a man leave his apartment three times, on a rainy night, with a suitcase? And come back three times?
Not that salesman's wife. And why didn't he go to work today?
Homework. It's more interesting.
What are you getting at?
Okay, Lisa -- probably you're right. He's probably in the bedroom now, entertaining his wife with the indian rope trick. I'll admit to criminal insanity. Now when do I start the cure?
What's the apartment house number?
He had it hidden in the dresser! Well, at least it was in there. He took it out, went to the phone and called somebody long distance. -- His wife's jewelry was in the handbag. And something about it worried him. He was asking somebody advice over the phone.
Because she didn't know she was going on a trip -- and where she was going she wouldn't need a handbag.
That Mrs. Thorwald left at six ayem yesterday with her husband?
Don't rush me. We have all night.
I'd be no better than Thorwald, to refuse.
Is he cleaning house?
We got to do something.  Don't we?
Smashed the front door.
No--
You can't protect me.
You mind if I try?  You have to slam the door in my face?  I try to get to him--what happens?  Don't I give you everything you want?  A bicycle--you get a bicycle. A car--
Yeah!
That's funny!
I better clean this up before she sees it.
Listen--I took a steak out of the freezer.  I thought we could have a real old-fashioned stag party--just the two of us, what do you say?
You know I never stop you from anything.  Believe me--you're at a wonderful age.  In ten years you'll look back on this and wish you were a kid again.
I just want to show you how foolish you are.  When you're older you'll laugh at yourself for thinking this is so important--
Sure--there was a bad accident there.  They showed the pictures on T.V.
Are you listening to me?  You're involved in this!  I want to go to the police and tell them I was mixed up in this thing tonight?
What's that pounding?
Yes, sir.
Jim.  What's yours?
Plato.  It's a nickname.
No.  It's okay.
It's me!
Everybody!  Crunch and Goon and everybody!  I think they're going to kill you.
Judy.
Come out come out wherever you are!
Who?
We didn't run out.  We were coming right back.
Sure I'm sure.  Judy's waiting. You ready to come out now?
My gun?
They like you.  Okay?
Ray!  Will you tell these guys to move back?
Stop tearing me apart!  You say one thing and he says another and then everybody changes back--
I can't keep it to myself anymore--
Just tell a little white lie?
Sure it is.  You want to bug us till we have to lock you up.  Why?
I mean if he had the guts to knock Mom cold once I bet she'd be happy and I bet she'd stop picking.  They make mush out of him.  Just mush. One thing I know is I never want to be like him.
Chicken?
You got me, Jim--but they do.  Want some water?
"Life is crushing in on me."
Where I saw you.  Everything going okay now?  You live around here?
No.
So have I.  But I've never been in love.  Isn't that awful?
How many rooms do you think there are?
I don't know--you just are. Leaving a light for Plato.  That was nice.
You disappointed?
We have to go back!
No!  I got to find him.
Sure.  He was trying to make us his family.
Well, that's the main thing--don't you think so?
Yes!  I don't know!  I mean maybe he doesn't mean it but he acts like he does.  We're altogether and we're going to celebrate Easter and catch a double bill.  Big deal.  So I put on my new dress and I came out and he--
That one?
Do you think you can get back at your Dad that way?  I mean sometimes if we can't get as close to somebody as we'd like we have to try making them jealous--so they'll have to pay attention.  Did you ever think of that?
What?
Your mother will be down in a few minutes.
But the same song.  I think it's fantastic!
With us old creeps?  Come on, we have to eat.
Hi.
Girls don't love their father? Since when?  Since I got to be sixteen?
Read a lot about you, Nick.
He'll be dead when he does.
C'mon. How old are you, sixteen? C'mon.
I don't think it's negative five.
You are to me.
I can get another one going. Y'know, hey, whatever you want me to --
No, no, no. Be like you want to be.
I've been dreaming about that smile, Ashley Mercer. For a long time.
Go to hell, Nick Mason, what's that supposed to mean --
I'm talking about the heart, Nick. I'm not talking about the words.
Y'know, some of the heart mighta been his too...
Yeah, well you wrote me you were six- foot-four, baby.  So don't talk to me about little white lies.
Blackjack, Nick, blackjack I am good at. I mean, they'd give us some free games or something, wouldn't they? Since you worked there?
Security, Ash, I just worked security. They wouldn't be rolling out the red carpet --
We'll have more fun in Detroit.
NICK!
Nick, no --
Nick died for me....
But you knew why. Knew why, didn't ya.
They run routes mostly east, retail stuff, warehouses. But Gabriel knows some guys in New York, Miami, guys he helps get guns to Detroit. Hides 'em with his regular loads.
He working for them on this one?
Ash. Don't say it. Don't say my name.
You shouldn't have.
You were screaming you weren't Nick! And we just didn't fucking believe you!
Yes!
Yes!
What'd they call her in college?
We got faith in you, Nick Mason.  You're our inside man.
Why not.
'Cause you're gonna get me a disguise.
At least gimme video poker.
I have no gifts to bring, pa-rumpum- pum-pum
Hey! HEY! THERE IS A POWWOW SAFE!
How'd you know my name...
Leave the tree.
I don't steal any --
Mr. Bangs.
The tribe is concerned that many of your... new ideas are not resulting in any new venues.
Oh. Right. Yeah. That's, uh upstairs. Uh. Here. Powwow Safe.
Cancer-sucker.
Hi, Nick.
Hell you haven't.
Got us a motel out Highway 5, bringing her own damn sheets, you read that part? Silk damn sheets. Lock ourselves in the whole week, drinking wine, taking baths, man, see if they got those room service steaks... anything I want to do. Remember when she wrote that? Anything I want...
I'm just saying.
Hotwiring cars, Rudy, does not qualify as a small business. Chop shop consultant; doesn't work on a resume.
She set them up. All of them.
That was my king!
You're hitting for MY cards!
You're taking my money. Switch seats with me. Switch seats with me if you're not taking my money --
Then get yourself another table! You're hitting Santa's cards and you're taking Santa's money!
I'M NOT NICK!
Yeah, Elois. E and Lois. We called her Lady E.
Well, let's go get it. We also gotta get rid of all those cars. It looks like Sam's hot car lot outside.  You stay here and babysit Orange and the cop.  You two take a car each, I'll follow ya. You ditch it, I'll pick you up, then we'll pick up the stones. And while I'm following you, I'll arrange for some sort of a doctor for our friend.
It's not the black Beverly Hills, it's the black Palos Verdes. Anyway, this chick, Elois, was a man-eater- upper. I bet every guy who's ever met her has jacked off to her at least once. You know who she looked like? Christie Love. 'Member that TV show "Get Christie Love"? She was a black female cop. She always used to say "You're under arrest, sugar."
Did the two of you talk?
What?
What?
I can do that.
He's a cool guy. A real nice, real funny, real cool guy.
I stand outside and guard the door. I don't let anybody come in or go out.
Mr. Brown stays in the car. He's parked across the street till I give him the signal, then he pulls up in front of the store.
Crowd control. They handle customers and employees in the display area.
It's not about a nice girl who meets a sensitive boy. Now granted that's what "True Blue" is about, no argument about that.
Fuck you, wrong. I'm right! What the fuck do you know about it anyway? You're still listening to Jerry- fucking-Vale.
Jesus Christ, Joe. Fuckin' forget it. This is beneath me. I'm Mr. Pink, let's move on.
Five-man job. Bustin' in and bustin' out of a diamond wholesaler's.
He's doin' twenty years in Susanville.
How many employees?
Like hell I am.
Nope.
You do?
Frankie Ferchetti introduced us once, about five months ago.
What the fuck are they waiting for? That motherfucker cut off my ear! He slashed my face! I'm deformed!
Fuck 'em, they set off the alarm, they deserve what they got.
Down to my car.
No, I'm not!
I wasn't born yesterday. I'm hurt, and I'm hurt bad.
Blonde went crazy. He slashed the cop's face, cut off his ear and was gonna burn him alive.
Don't tell me your name, I don't want to know! I sure as hell ain't gonna tell ya mine.
Uh-uh, just cops.
Me and Mr. Orange jumped in the car and Mr. Brown floored it. After that, I don't know what went down.
Yeah, and that was a fucking miracle. But if they did get away, where the fuck are they?
I got the diamonds.
I got 'em, all right?
That was the plan, we meet here.
What?
So what is it?
You didn't tell him your name, did ya?
If we don't, he'll die.
Cut the bullshit, we ain't on a fuckin' playground!  I don't believe this shit, both of you got ten years on me, and I'm the only one actin like a professional. You guys act like a bunch of fuckin' niggers. You ever work a job with a bunch of niggers? They're just like you two, always fightin', always sayin' they're gonna kill one another.
You takin' his side?
Yeah, those guys too.
I've got eleven horses to get over the mountains before snow catches me and covers the feed.
Like you said, maybe he knows where my ranch is. If he does, he'll be waiting on the porch.
I wouldn't know. Did you ask her?
Why didn't you say so. Go right out and get her. Ed. build the fire up.
It was a gift from the citizens of Aspen. I'm Mary Wells.
Course I can't. I'll give you a lift to the first ranch.
You can stay here if you like.
I'm not in his shoes, so leave me out of it.
And it's not only because the trip's a tough one --
You've earned it -- the horse ranch on the Toulomoe -- the girl in the spotted gingham.
So that's it --  You think I was making fun of your girl in gingham.
Goodbye, Mary.
Hello, Miss Wells.
A man I used to know.
In a fight?
Things get tough next winter, you'll have somethin' to wear.
Sure I do. Went off down to Mexico or something...
Yeah, it does.
Finished, son?
I'll eat when I'm good and ready.
Kind of feeling your oats this morning. I haven't laid a hand on you for quite a while, but that doesn't mean you're too old.
What makes you think you're so almighty? Telling people what to do and how to act when you don't even know how yourself.
You want to split up? --
So -- maybe I'm old enough to tell you how to run your life?
I guess so -- but don't make a habit of it.
All right, you didn't know.
What's there to be fair about?
I don't care.
There, there. Don't you upset yourself --
Yes, people make me restless.
Even women?
And you're all alone.
Yeah.
I don't like to see you go.
Why didn't you say you wanted to get married back in Aspen. I told the man in Sonora there were four of us. If only three show up, he might call the whole deal off. We've got to stick together. Like we've always done.
We don't want to go there.
No we don't. But that's where we're going. From Minden we take a stage to Reno, then another one over to Auburn and another one to Placerville. Then it's a day's trip to Sonora.
Maybe you are. I'm not.
He can wait. Let's stay here until morning.
Without someone to teach you, it's tough.
Hmmm... sort of like a horse -- with a horn in the center of its forehead.
Kind of tough, I guess... But you're not liable to hunt them -- I don't think there's any alive now, anyways -- and I'm not sure but I don't think there ever were...
You don't read to fill your stomach... Poetry, for instance. All the poems in the world wouldn't fill you half as much as a bowl of eatmeal -- but they make you feel good.
Oh, I wasn't worrying.  I saw him saddling up and thought he was ready to leave.
I found a picture of his wife.
Never happened!
Hello Ray.
Ray, have you been here all this time?
I just wanted to make sure you were okay.
So, I guess I can go now.
He's so brave.
Then what kinda stuff can we do?
Let's get outta here.
Hugh Kane.
Come on. There's a first aid kit in the lab.
Can you feel that?
Actually, I was going to say let me have your computer if you die.
Look, what I'm trying to say --
I don't want to be your friend like this anymore.
That sounds kinda gay, but since you're a guy, I guess it's okay.
Yeah.  Can I borrow five bucks?
She killed herself a week before he died.
Oh, my God, Ray! What are you doing here?
Right behind you.
Don't worry Cindy, the brain itself feels no pain.
I don't need your help.
Quick, everyone to the lab.
We? What do you mean... we?
Huh?
Oh.
They're on top of the bookshelf. I'll get them.
Any of them hot?
That's Ray Williams. I couldn't quite figure him out, but he seemed very eager and excited when we met.
How are we going to get them all up there?
That one.
Ah, yes, which reminds me, who here thinks they'd wake up if somebody snuck into their room and started sniffing between their legs?
I think we should consider cutting the experiment short.
Hi.
Oh, I couldn't do that.
Alright. Come on, you guys.
Thanks, handyman.
I'm not even wearing any drawers. Forget about a belt.
I guess so.
I am Tom Green, I am Tom Green. Daddy want some sausage, sausage. Daddy want some sausage...
"Ray!"
Mother? 
You don't think...
If Mom's a psycho, Scotty will still be ok, won't he?
Is there a killer loose?
Keep the change, you son of a psycho!
But Mom, the video's not over.
Time to get up, that's all. You'll be late for work.
But, Chip...
Surely you don't think Beverly was involved!
MISTY SUTPHIN, GET IN THIS CAR!!
Misty, I made your favorite sesame broccoli... 
It's Ok, Eugene. I understand... I'll go fix breakfast. 
Sorry, ma'am.  We're investigating obscene phone calls and mail threats to a certain Mrs. Dottie Hinkle.
I know Dottie!
GODDAMN YOU! THAT'S TRESPASSING!
NO I DON'T, YOU BITCH!
Well, Dottie, how come they're not here then, Fuck-Face?
GODDAMN YOU!
No, I don't.
One beer with lunch is hardly "drinking".
No, honey, it's the police.  Hello, officers.
Always something isn't it?  Can I help you?
Watch the booth! I'll be back! 
You want me to keep that under the table for you?
Ewwww!  Thank you, Rosemary.
Then you know that if I give you a little advice, it'll be good advice.
That's what I tried to find out.	I went to La Jeunesse   -- used a phony health inspector's badge  they let me go through the works -- all but one room. That room was locked. I'd like to see the inside of that room.
Which room is it?
You're not a dipsomaniac at your age?
What sort of danger?
She's nervous, naturally, under the circumstances.
She seems rather an odd woman to me.
She's a pretty good sort.
Thank you.
Yes.
Afraid she might commit suicide?  People who commit suicide don't talk about it. That room made her happy in some strange way I couldn't understand. She lived in a world of her own fancy. She didn't always tell the truth. In fact - I'm afraid she didn't know what the truth was.  There were many things about Jacqueline I didn't understand, and yet, without understanding, I had to be with her  to see her  to touch her  in order to be happy. It's hard to explain to a youngster.
Good.
Maybe the Romaris might have a room. They seem nice.
Oh, I had business with a man... but I missed him -
Well, I'm glad you came to see me.
You don't even know Jacqueline Gibson.
And you don't want to die. I've always wanted to die -- always.
You will die.
Yes. I was going to tell you to look into your own heart -- do you really want to find your sister?
I'm at sea, Jason.
I thought it would be, but just to be sure, I'll tell you that the Palladists are a society of Devil worshippers --
I can imagine.
Jason, I'm going back to Highcliffe. I came to say good-by.
I'm a good boy, but no one listens to what I say.
I wouldn't want to take them out. I just want to look at them.
But why come to me?
She was my patient.
I've lost my knack.
I should like people to read what I've written.
I hope it finds as much favor as your other book -- but somehow I doubt it -- the time is out of tune.
No other reason  no woman not the little Miss Gibson?
I never thought you did.
No, she's with her sister,
I didn't know.
That won't be necessary. I haven't much to say.
I had to help get rid of the body. You saw it on the subway. And I warn you, Mary -- go back -- you don't know what you're doing, or what dreadful things you might bring about by looking for your sister. You go back to school - - go back and forget Jacqueline.
Oh yes, yes. One day a beautiful car comes here. This beautiful lady in furs gets out. There is a handsome man with her, and the chauffeur  The lady rents one of our upstairs rooms. The chauffeur changes the lock on the door. Then the lady never comes back --not to live, anyhow. She came back three, four times, but always alone and just to eat.
I doubt if you'll get anything out of that woman. But if  you'd like to try, I'll advance you the money to make the trip to New York. Of course, my dear, if you don't find your sister, you can always come back here.
She's very beautiful.
I'll be right back with Mrs. Wheeler.
I can quote that too; "Those who shall go out into the market place and let their tongues speak of us, and give knowledge of our being and our deeds, whom-so-ever doeth this shall die."
What about Judd -- he knows about us.
False alarm.
No, I was in charge of kind of standing at the microphone and reciting these really depressing lyrics in a monotone. The whole thing was really... irrelevant. How do you like being married?
Well... well, the clich about the security of it, that's really true. We own a house, and I really like that, you know? And I like that John was just made junior partner, so he has a steady job and he's not some...
Exactly. I would say the fact that you feel the first year of your marriage has gone by quickly means lots of things. Or could mean lots of things.
Thank you.
Ann. Hello.
Donna. On this tape it says "Donna".
Why not?
Mostly. Sometimes they do things.
This is just... so...
How did you know?
Yes.
I'm babbling.
No, you're not.
You should be. He lied to you. So did Cynthia.
So why won't you make love with me? Why wouldn't you, I mean?
I've told you.
But you're planning to be?
But that was part of it?
All right!! All right!! You want to know? You want to know how I feel? I feel ashamed. Is that what you wanted to hear?
Mmmmm...
Are you having an affair?
Always the lawyer.
Goddam right. I mean, can you imagine: "Your honor, I'm positive this man is guilty. I can't place him at the scene or establish a motive, but I have this really strong feeling."
Did you masturbate?
I take it you've never masturbated?
Yes.
Not really.
I say it because it's descriptive.
What are you talking about?
And what?
Will you stop? Jesus.
Well, what, then?
Then why'd you call me?
I don't know.
You couldn't do it, period.
I feel like I do.
That doesn't mean you do. You can't possibly trust him, he's... perverted.
It does not.
She must have been in a good mood when she said that. She usually calls me loud.
She called you that, too. May I ask why you're here?
No, I really can't. I find it healthy never to characterize people I don't know or conversations I haven't heard. I don't know what you and your sister discussed about me or anything else. Last time I saw Ann she left here very... confused, I would say. And upset.
And are you here to berate me for making her that way?
Nope.
Nope. I think the man is a liar.
What makes you think I'd discuss that with you?
And that's all?
Yes.
Was it ever a topic of conversation between the two of you afterward?
Not really. I didn't picture it with veins or ridges or anything, I thought it would be smooth, like a test tube.
He said that my hand felt good.
Then what happened?
Do you like the way I look?
Cynthia. John.
How about inviting me over to dinner?
Look, I'll call you, okay?
Jesus. I could almost understand it if he was screwing these people, almost. Why doesn't he just buy some magazines or porno movies or something?
Why not?
It won't. I trust him.
Well, I'm here now. I'd like to do something...
Did he put you up to this?
No, he didn't put me up to this. Jesus, I don't need people to tell me what I should do. I've just been thinking about things, that's all.
Not for three-fifty.
Or go someplace in a hurry.
Where are the tapes, Graham?
What the hell do you think? I love Ann. You think I'm going to tell her about Cynthia and hurt her feelings like that?
John Millaney.
One moment.
He said immediately.
Hi. Want a drink?
Buy 'em with what, dumbhead?
Oh, no. I haven't seen Dr. Hobbes since I was in medical school. He taught me... he was my prof in urology and... I think he conducted a few seminars in psychopharmacology. That was it. I had no idea he'd ever set foot in Starliner Towers until today.
He sounded fine.
Mm? OK. Be with you in a sec.
I think I... I think I killed him. I stabbed him with something and he fell.
Will you be OK now? I've got to go to your place to see if he's still there. I've got to see if it's... if it's what we both think it is.
Nick, you're so strange...
Oh, Nick, Nick... I can't take this.
Mr. Parkins, what makes you think you caught these lumps of yours from a young lady?
Well, let's wait for the X-rays.
You touch my spleen, Rollo.  And here all the time I was thinking -- if I ever bothered to think about the good old days -- well, at least there's Rollo. He's in VD and he's happy.
It was women did it to Hobbes. Couldn't handle them. That girl, that Annabelle -- talk about crazy projects.
That you, Rog?
It looks like -- and I quote -- 'a disease to save man from his mind.'
Lemme clarify for you.
I dunno. Try tranquilizers. Once you can get at them, there's a lotta stuff you can use. I'll bring a bagful. It's just the standard tropical kit. But the trick is to get at them.
NIGHT NIGHT
BREAKING OUT
Congratulations!  It's 'Happy Homes' for Harry and Emily Weiss of Denton.
You got it!
Of course!  D.T.V.'s most popular Hospital series featuring those perennial favorites, Cosmo and Nation McKinley. Neuro-specialists par excellence ...if you'll pardon my French. I recommend you send Brad to them for treatment!
Can I just 'peep in' on Brad before I go home?
Everyone loves the girl next door, particularly Farley.
They probably meant Irving and wanted you to swing.
Who trusts experts?
Show yourself.  The real you. The secret you.
Oh, Oliver, you're so tolerant. Time for a coffee before you rush off?
Isn't that Brad and Janet Majors sitting down front?  What an ideal couple.
Overreact!  You're the one with theories about conspirac...  Oliver?
I don't want to get up there.
What are you trying to do?  Make Bert look like a fool?  He's made all the arrangements.
SOME PEOPLE DO IT FOR THE MONEY
Well...maybe I could wear my black leather brogues?
Could you tell us a little about it?
What show?
Janet!  Where's that lovely dress I made you?
If only Brad could have found it within his heart to say these things to me.
EVER SINCE I WAS A LITTLE BOY DRESSING UP HAS ALWAYS BEEN MY GREATEST JOY BUT WHEN IT'S TIME TO BE DISCREET THERE'S ONE THING YOU JUST CAN'T BEAT THAT'S A STRAPLESS, BACKLESS CLASSICAL LITTLE BLACK
We understand you've been going through a rather trying time.
YOU'RE NO GOOD
YOU PLAY FOR BROKE...
LIKE A DEEP PLUM LIPSTICK AND SOME THERAPEUTICS
Hang on. Did you ever know a Derek Sommersby?
I ask you one simple question, and suddenly I'm attacking you.
Hey, Evelyn, it's your favorite client.
Yeah, I'm here.
If I was, I would sing your praises up and down the street until they put me in the loony bin. Now Miles, why didn't you tell me you were coming and bringing this handsome man? Look how I'm dressed. I've got to run and put my face on.
I could have made something fancier if a certain someone had let me know that a certain someone was coming for a visit with a certain special friend. Could have made a pork roast.
Excellent. My friend and I are up here doing the wine tour, and he tells me that you folks make one hell of a Syrah.
Good. How're you?
Hi. Well, nice to see you guys here. Bye, Miles.
Maybe. Recognize this?
Yeah, Conundrum.
That's a 1992 Byron. It's really rare. Don't open it now. I've been saving it!
Jesus. Don't ask questions like that up in the wine country. They'll think you're a moron.
Oh, yeah. Yeah.
Um... seventy... something.
As if she'd even be attracted to guys like us in the first place.
Speak for yourself. I get chicks looking at me all the time. All ages.
Thanks, Jack. So do I.  Here we are.
Depends on the varietal. Just get a sense of it. Thick? Thin? Watery? Syrupy? Inky? Amber, whatever...
Now tip it. What you're doing here is checking for color density as it thins toward the rim. Tells you how old it is, among other things, usually more important with reds. This is a very young wine, so it's going to retain its color pretty solidly. Now stick your nose in it.
I don't know. Wine? Fermented grapes?
Now set your glass down and get some air into it.
We're not getting any younger, right? And my career, well, it's gotten pretty, you know, frustrating. Even with my new manager. Maybe it's time to settle down.
Yeah. It's good. Feels good.
Now I've got another lie to live down. Thanks, Jack.
No, see, I want both of us to get crazy. We should both be cutting loose. I mean, this is our last chance. This is our week! It should be something we share.
I want to go home now.
And if they want to drink Merlot, we're drinking Merlot.
Oh Jesus, Miles.
Shut up. Shut your face.
She's been leaving messages here too.
What?
Um... not exactly. But I've been honest. I haven't told her I'm available. And she knows this trip up here is only for a few days. Besides...
Well... I don't know, just... the wedding.
This is totally different. I'm talking about avoiding what you're talking about. That's the distinction. I have not made the commitment yet. I am not married. I have not said the words. In a few days, I might get married, and if I do, then I won't be doing stuff like this anymore. Otherwise, what's the whole point of getting married?
Here's what I'm thinking. We move up here, you and me, buy a vineyard. You design your own wine; I'll handle the business side. Then you get inspired and write a new novel. As for me, if an audition comes along, hell, LA'S two hours away. Not even.
You said she was shallow. Yeah, and a nouveau riche.
Yeah.
What do you think's going on?
You have to tell me --
I SAID OKAY?
Are they too sporty?
Let me use your phone.
What's up?
Don't give up. You're going to make it.
See? Right there. Just what you just said. That's beautiful. A thumbprint on a skyscraper. I couldn't write that.
Cutting it a little close, don't you think?  So how was she? Compared to Stephanie, say.
The plan is... you go.
That was quite a day yesterday.
What the fuck!
I'll pay for it.
No, not whatever. You fucking derelict.
Maya, how are you?
You know it. This is my friend Jack. Jack, Maya.
I know. I love that.
It might be too late already. What are you waiting for?
She's with her grandmother. She's with Steph's mom. She spends a lot of time over there. Steph's... well, she's Stephanie.
Who me? Nah, I'd just fuck them up. That was the one unpolluted part of my divorce -- no kids.
Yeah, same here.
Like what a fraud he was.
Well, nice to see you now.
I'm sure he believed every word.
It's Miles. Listen, I don't know if you even care, but I had to call and tell you again how much I enjoyed our time together and how sorry I am things turned out the way they did. I think you're great, Maya -- always have. From the first time you waited on me.  And while I'm at it, I guess you should know that my book is not getting published. I thought this one had a chance, but I was wrong. Again. Don't bother reading it -- you've got better things to do. So you see I'm not much of a writer. I'm not anything really. The only real talent I seem to have is for disappointing people and now you know that firsthand. We're leaving in the morning, and I want you to know that I take with me wonderful memories of you. I'm sorry. I'm really sorry.
Oh. Huh. Well...  Congratulations again, Vicki. That's wonderful news.
About four weeks.
Where?
You fucking bastard! Lying piece of shit! You're getting married on Saturday? What was all that shit you said to me?
...I will.
Boy, why aren't you in the pros making stacks of cash and getting handfuls of T and A?
Curse and stuff.
Yes, it was.
What does it matter then?
Did they say what our chances would be if they did invade?
From what?
Listen, there's things I can take and a couple things I can't and one of them I can't take, is when my older brother --  -- who is everything I want to be, starts losing faith in things. I saw your eyes last night.  I don't want to ever see your eyes like that again, okay? I'm serious.
Have they said anything about our area?
Oh.
The family room.
Now we're talking.  How about you Merrill?
Don't yell at her!
What about them?
Some animals around the county exhibiting uncharacteristic behavior. Sometimes violent behavior. Theo Henry had two of his fingers bit off by his cow.
Honest to God, Emmett, he would've killed me.
Your next water ain't for three days.
All right then.  Let's go.
Sure.
McKendrick's men got him.
It's one thing to know it...
I already did that.
In my town, when you're looking for someone, you ask me.
Women?
He is that.
I hate to see any man swing. Bad luck.
All right, you buy me a drink.
I'm going to California with my brother.
What about the law?
Never will again.
Believe it.
What's that?
His son is worse than he was. He's smoother, so you don't always hear him coming, but he'll do anything to keep his range free.
Sure we are. We're leaving at dawn.
He'll be here.
Is there a place in town that takes... my kind?
I don't like that word much, Carter.
We don't serve them here and you know it. I asked him to leave and he went crazy on us. He owes me money for this damage.
I'm not thinking about your future, Paden. I'm worried about Stella.
Yeah. Bad luck.  Good-bye, Cobb.
Stella.
I am. I'm always there, but I only shine at night.
Yeah, aside from being a loud-mouthed, lying cheat, he's just the man I would have picked.
Why'd you go into business with him?
I meant, seemed like a lot of whiskey.
If he didn't you'd never sit still while this was happening.
Of course.
Who?
It wasn't her body.  It was her body of work.
I'm glad we talked.
Good-bye.
-- It's called a projector.
Listen, Viktor, I have good memories of those days too -- but this isn't about that or you or me or some high-minded ideal.  This is business.
Spare me.
So there's no problem -- I can have the rights, the negative too?
Don't thank me.  It was entirely Simone's decision.  Do you have Simone's check?
I can't wait to meet her.
She's my actor.  There are other studios, Elaine.  There's only one Simone.  Leave the press conference to me.
There isn't one.
Everyone I know has met her, Viktor.
I'd love to.  But aren't you supposed to meet up with Simone?
It's a crowded summer.  We need every photo-opp, sound-byte and column inch we can get.  Good night, Viktor.
I can imagine.
-- And she was positively glowing at the awards.  I should be going, she'll be here soon --
That's sweet, Viktor, but I couldn't let you do that -- make that kind of sacrifice.  It's strange.  I've stabbed people in the back, clawed and slept my way to where I am -- it goes with the territory -- but, for some reason, I can't betray Simone. There's... I don't know any other way to say it -- there's a goodness to her.
-- She's a figment of my own imagination.  I, Viktor Taransky, have perpetrated the greatest hoax, the greatest sleight-of-hand, sleight-of-mouth, sleight-of- sleight in entertainment history! And still no one appreciates me, recognizes what I've done -- even you.
Hello, is this Elaine?
-- We don't believe daddy because we don't want to believe we were taken in too.
Elaine, do you realize you can't stop talking about Viktor?
... so much like her?
Yes, call me Simone.
I just think actors talk too much. Does the world really want to hear your life story just because you've got a movie opening Friday?
I suppose the thing I like most about the movies I'm in is that they're not about special effects.
Viktor, Clyde simply has to get close to Simone in this scene!  He has to touch her.  He has to!
Absolutely not!
It can -- with my new computer code, you and me, we can do it together.
I just came out to support my good friend, Simone.
Don't feel too bad.  Mom runs the place and they still walk all over her.  You're better off out of it.
Hello, Lainey.
I saw her picture on the, er... internet.  You really didn't notice anything -- unusual?
Only her brilliance.  To be honest, with what you had to work with, I was expecting a train wreck.  You really pulled it off.
I do.
You do?  Still?  I can't tell you how happy I am to hear that.
I know, Hal is as stiff as always.
Night, Lainey.
It's fantastic -- it's too much.
I know.  Thank her for me.
This is the story.
They are alive, Sayer.
I'd like to see that, Sayer. Invite me.
It's a yacht.
I think you do.  I know it's a fake.
-- I've looked at every piece of publicity she's ever done, the video in the supermarket, there's no evidence she's ever left the studio.  Oh, and for some reason this woman leaves no paper trail.  But I have "obtained" a copy of your bank accounts.  I know you have power of attorney but so far you haven't transferred one single solitary cent to her.
She looks a lot like you.
That won't be necessary.  Sooner or later I knew you'd crack this thing, Max.  You got me.
Which means they're significant.  Incriminating.  Perhaps, criminal.  She's hiding her past.  She's hiding her past.
What do you want -- ?
Mr. Sayer, did we pay the million bucks yet?
-- Cashier's check went out to our anonymous tipster this morning -- worth every penny too.  Who says there's no place for checkbook journalism?  We'll be running stills of this for months, then release the whole tape -- we'll get our money back -- maybe show it on an exclusive pay-per-view event. Do you realize what we have here? We have the only independent footage of Simone in existence.
Is that why she left you?
Yes, of course it is.  You know you have a line here.  Not a wrinkle.  Actually, more of a dimple.  I've been thinking of incorporating something like that in Simone.
Let it burn.  Simone would rather go up in flames than give up her privacy.
Not, "Eternity Forever"?  The legendary unproduced script that was too good ever to get made?  I'd kill for that part.
I knew there was a sound explanation.
No, just one.
I work with young people who might be sad or upset or just want to talk. I try to help them figure things out.
Yeah, Private Kinney needed to get back safe to take care of her.
He your best buddy?
I don't tell her a thing.
Yes.
No.
You have to add some twists and stuff. Maybe they run out of gas.
They don't know they're dead?
I know every child is special in their own way, but Tommy sounds like a punk.  I thought the play was excellent. Better than Cats.
I don't know.
Soon. One week.
Don't fail me.
Where will you go, where no one has died?
Maybe.
Lots of things.
Don't get mad.
So who moved it?
Dead people.
You think I'm a freak?
She wanted me to tell you, she saw you dance.
They used to hang people here.
Who!
Stuttering Stanley! Stuttering Stanley!
--Shhhhhhut upppp you fffffffreak!
I wish I could be like my momma though. She always knew what was wrong. Knew just what to say.
How'd he know I'd come?
Chicken blood on the crops.
Fuck you! If you're such an expert on music, why don't you go get your dueling banjo and sit in on the next song?
Witch.
The hell with this.  I'm coming back up!!!
Well, why don't you hold these as evidence in the meantime.
-- "Billy-Jean" --
Shotgun. Suicide. Next?
Come out, come out wherever you are!
Joseph Macdonald. Damn right, boy. And don't you forget it.
Pardon?
This is his room... isn't it?
Who then, Jeremiah?? -- Who?!
Amends...?
Yeah. Our own. I don't see why we got to go along for the ride.
Amen.
Yeah. Sure. I'm screwing up the song. You're the one who's been two beats behind since we kicked it off.
Yeah. That sounds good. "Hang a left at the first cow patty, then make a right when you see porky pig".
So?
Look. You want to talk about this?
Wait a minute --
I... saw him -- he tried to kill me -- he's, he's -- still -- out there --
No. Not without you --
Second verse!
CARL??? Carl did this?!!
Bill, I'll run out to your car, call for paramedics from there.
When you wanted to run away, I called your dad.
No, Starla! No!
Yeah. Good.
Aspirin.
Think we should get up a search party, head in there?
Your momma wasn't too proud when you came out neither, Wally.
Yeah.
What?
How many you need?
Yep. And while you're at it, get me a few of them chicken wings... some pork loins... and, ooo, what's this here? Osso buco?...
You're my princess, aren't you?
Heh. It ain't as bad as it looks, sugarplum. Dr. Carl was just here. I had a reaction to a bee sting. He gave me a prescription. Said I should be fine, in a couple days.
Hey, look!
Margaret.
You.
Who'd want to?
No. I want to know what you think about besides ditching Smokey?
We're cool. The dumb schmuck took the wrong turn.
What do you want to be when you grow up?
Hey...
I've never seen him before in my life. I'm just trying to help you out.
What kind of a guy is he?
The minute you see him, you'll know.
That man is your father?!?
Couple of cheeseburgers, no condiments...
No.
Quit being so negative, guy; 'course we're gonna make it. We ain't never not made it, have we?
Now, if I say go to channel three, it really means go to six.
Bandit?
Forty-two minutes ahead.
Anything else you don't want me to know?
You okay?
Ticking away, but it looks like a clear shot to Hot Town. Green lights and white lines all the way.
But they're waiting for me. They don't even know Cledus Snow exists.
I don't know where he's goin' or what he's doin', but I sure hope to God he makes it.
If that sumbitch was in the race, he'd be in the winner's circle by now.
Then it must be a helluva idea.
-- Okey, doke. Last one to the Roadeo is a homo.
Based on what we had, I thought Sparazza was a mid-level player at best and it turns out he's this mob relic, running the show out west.
He uh -- he asked about -- I'm -- he wanted to know whic-- what floor security was on, then I saw him get on the elevator with the other agent.
The other agent. He said he was here to do an inspection and later, when he got on the elevator with the other guy, Carruthers, I saw him wearing one of our security jackets...
Mmm-hmm.
But there were more of you?
Two of 'em?
You woulda?
Oh hell yeah. We's just in the wrong place at the wrong time. So don't feel so bad dude.
About cocaine... and the amount you're doing.
-- Jack, what am I doing? I'm standing here, aren't I?  Shouldn't that be enough? That I made the trip?
I said I got his machine.
Look at the collar on that coat...
Cinnamon roll? No, good guess though. No, Hugo that looks like jizz...  And I'm no forensic expert mind you, but that looks like some fuckhead shot their load on a twelve-thousand dollar calf's skin jacket. The twist? It's My twelve thousand dollar, calf's skin jacket.  So y'got semen, human ejaculate --  -- that's been allowed to soak in for what, six, seven hours now? Work it's way into the fabric-fuck'n fibers -- and while you may never see it in a Tide commercial, I think it still safely qualifies as a "tough, deep down stain."
Are you a fucking colossal idiot?
Without peer?
I -- uh, yeah, I guess, yeah.
Difficult to explain everything now...  And much larger issues loom.  I'm sorry about Carruthers... Damndest thing to have to die for.
-- no, we need to handle it now.
No... It's not.  What it lacks... is an end.
Bag this fucker Buzzy.
I ain't even goin' dignify that. You my road dog. We threw up sets.  Plus you stank.
Not you. Some assholes on the elevator... are these bitches on a permanent smoke break or what? Why the fuck they call'm "working girls."
What?
What's the time frame?
What do you want?
You're not Gibarian...
Yes.
How much sleep?
I wish you'd told me.
To who?
An enormous amount of money changed hands to get control of this project. We are in little danger of being left alone for long.  You'll need to do something. Otherwise they'll be sending someone out to recover you.
If God is beyond our comprehension, and she --  -- is here for reasons that can't be understood, isn't God here?
Perhaps it did.
But they are human.  They certainly become human with incredible speed. First they're like they were in our memory, but then they fill in on their own.  DNA doesn't determine the hundreds of trillions of connections that occur in the brain, it's not dense enough.  They build up with experience.
Into what?
I love her.
You do, you don't.  She's willing to give her life, you're willing to give yours, it's touching and magnificent, anything you want but -- this isn't the place for it.  Don't you see?  No, you don't.
I'll just be a minute.
You behave as though you want to fuck her.
Rheya.  Not here.
I know, I know.  But still, somehow I don't feel better.
It's genetics.  You know this.  You know where it comes from.  There is nothing wrong with uncrossing a few crossed wires.
You know, I've decided: I'm just gonna believe what you believe about this whole Solaris thing, it'll make life so much easier; the little wife agreeing with her big, strong husband. You must get such a headache thinking about those Great Big Problems all day.
You don't love me.
Why did she do it?
Don't debate him; he'll say anything.
Rheya.
Do you?
It's all right.
Rheya --
Chris --
Then you won't make it.
I... I am Rheya.  But I am not the woman you loved ten years ago.
Last night.  You were talking to someone in the corridor.
Are the actions of Solaris premeditated?
Hello, Win.
Looks a little constipated to me.
Uh...
I think, maybe, that isn't such a great idea...
I'm supposed to call in.
Since you're going to be my escort, you'll need a new tie.
Sooner, the better.
They're kind of fuzzy.
Absolutely.  Look at this.
And "is"...?
That's nice.  And you live in Queens?  With a child, and a dog...?
I saw you with a dog, in my mind.
What's to like?
What do you want?
Stop being nuts!
I trusted you!  I thought you cared about me?!
What do you want to do?
Oh, I do want to know.  I tried to reach you at the precinct.
I've been doing a lot of thinking.
So.
... He killed Win... he enjoyed it...
Win made his choices, Claire.  We all do --
Amen to that.  The supermarket's full of assholes.
Take my advice, don't buy any...
Not great.  I've got a babysitting job for a material witness on a homicide.
'Til they pick up the perp.  Seniority gets day shift... You know what that means.
I think television's a dangerous thing.
It's twenty bucks in the bank.
Well, actually, she looks better than that.
You don't want to hear about it.
She's got to identify him.
I had to follow her to a store.
I know you're her bodyguard.  Did she buy it or did you?
Why?
Should I wait up?  We've got to get up early for the beach tomorrow.
Goddamn Venza assaulted a taxi driver in the Bronx, thirteen months ago.  It's coming to court and the judge let him walk because of the pending case law.
I'm talking about I've been talking this way for sixteen years and now, out of the blue, it's vulgar!
He's got a good lawyer, and he made a smart move.  We've got a scared witness and a suspect who proved "good will" by turning himself in.
What about when she identifies him?!
It was my fault, T.J.  Fuck!
No, sir...
I'll bring her in.  You let them go, and I'll bring her in.
I'm not lettin' no one go.
Get that gun away from his head, or I'll keep her from coming in!  Put the gun on me, he can't hurt you! He's tied up!  Put him under the table!
What the fuck you doin'?!
Lay back, Mack.
Be nice.
You stop him?
Eh.  If I ever get out from under. Maybe take May to France or somethin'.
Nonot really.
Flash, drop it--
I was sort of hoping to get out of--
Right.
Yeah--
I don't submit to blackmail!  The first amendment protects my freedom to tell the news as I imagine it, and--
Fine.
Hmf-hrr?
Even if they're not clever.
What if the world ends tomorrow?
Huh?
"Flash," Liz.  You're going out with something that calls itself "Flash."
Oh, don't do it on my account--
This from a man who winces at the cost of a pretzel?
So?  The next day I'd read, "Peter Parker murdered," and I'd feel...
Just shut up and close your eyes. This'll hurt.
I'm here...
But you said he went off a little, after the accident, when those mechanical arms--
Waldos.
No such thing as coincidence.  "God does not play dice with the universe."
Any sign of our friend?
--but I didn't feel like getting to know your roaches.
I'll introduce you.
Use a fork.
See?  You big dullard.
How is he?
He'll be fine. They won't tell me anything, but I'm sure he'll be fine.
I mean, I suddenly have immense physical power, and the ability to crawl up walls--
Do ya? Lemme give you the number for Bellevue.  That's 561-5151--
I will finish what I've begun
I'll repeat the experiment.  I will hold the truth. That's the only thing that matters.
I don't think I'll be running into him.
You never know.  Go get some sleep.
I was hoping you'd call, babe. Look, you got representation?
Nah.  The big mask was better.
Bonkers.
They never caught on.
Plenty.
There was that ammunition train in the depot at Frankfurt, see? So Dunbar gets himself in the men's room and fixes a time bomb, see? Then he waits until the train starts moving out, see? And one of the cars got the door open with some straw on the floor, see? So he throws it, see, and three minutes later -- voom! See?
Take some matches, see?  And a cigarette, see?  Tuck the cigarette in like this, see?  Now the cigarette keeps burning like a fuse, see?
Roger.
Who is it?
So long, Sefton.
Forty-five cigarettes. The price has gone up.
Ask Security.  You tell him, Price. You've got me shadowed every minute of the day. Or haven't you found out yet?
And maybe a little something else?
A little something what?
You make my mouth water.
Everybody but Joey, and you know who.
Which one of you is what?
Not you.
Of course you don't. Now, Lieutenant, how would you like to join me in my quarters? I have a nice fire going.
Whatever it is, it's out of your jurisdiction. This man is not a prisoner of war. Not any more. He is a saboteur.
Simply this. After the hostilities are ended, there will be such a thing as a War Crimes Commission. If this man should be convicted without proper proof, you will be held responsible, Colonel von Scherbach.
Stop it, Harry!
Let go, Animal! It's roll call! Hitler wants to see you!
I'm telling you, Animal, these Nazis ain't Kosher.
I said say it again. I didn't say repeat it.
Comrade! Comrade! Otchi Tchorniya -- Otchi Tchorniya!
You're teasing me again!
Do Jimmy Durante!
Why, sure!
This is me, Animal! It's Harry Shapiro!
As the duly elected Compound Chief, I protest the way these bodies are left lying in the mud.
Maybe it's crazy, but it's better than having Dunbar dead.
Just as you say, Hoffy. But wouldn't it be smarter if I went out and kept Schulz tied up?
Why the south latrine?
We did it.
Okay, then. Put a guard on me. I want you to put a guard on me. Because if anything goes wrong out there, this time you won't have a patsy. Right?
You did!
Let's synchronize the watches. Eleven forty-two, sharp.
Yes, I'm from Cleveland.
Amazing, what you can do with five thousand ping-pong balls, isn't it?
Go where? To the Kommandant's office and tell him where Dunbar is?
Suppose you let those mattresses cool off a little -- just out of decency?
And how about three hundred cigarettes for yourself?
I do not want those cigarettes.
Give it back. You must not arouse yourselves.
Tell you what to do. First, get yourself a hundred cigarettes for the Kraut guards. Then get yourself another face.
Full disruptors.
Captain. Perhaps you have forgotten that tomorrow is the christening ceremony.
Give me a list of those effects. I want to know every single thing which has been altered or changed, no matter how insignificant.
What do you mean?
I wanted to save Geordi. I tried. But I experienced something I did not expect.  I believe it was fear.
I believe so.
I believe the beverage has provoked an emotional response.
All hands, brace for impact!
Signal the closest starship. We're in no condition to mount a rescue. We don't even have a full crew aboard.
Oh yes. I remember everyone who was on the Lakul, every face. Even the ones who didn't make it.
I don't understand.
You're right. I'll need help.  Guinan, will you come back with me? Together, we could-
I'm from what you would consider the future; the 24th-century.
Temporal nexus, yeah, I heard you.  Something's missing.
You're a Starfleet officer and you have a duty to-
You could say that.
A photon torpedo?
Bad food, brutal discipline.  No women.
You want me to contact Starfleet?
There's nothing selfish about pursuing your own life, your own career.
Time has no meaning there. The predator has no teeth.
Why were they looking for it on a Federation observatory? It doesn't make any sense.
Aye, sir.
What's Grissom up to?... Will they join us, or fire on us...?  Chekov, break radio  silence. Send my compliments to Captain Esteban.
Bones... Can you give me a quadrant bi-scan?
Sector two... Indicating desert terrain. Minimal vegetation, temperature thirty-nine point four.
That may be difficult...
I used protomatter in the Genesis matrix.
And how many have paid the price for your impatience? How many have died? How much damage have you done... And what is yet to come?
I'll go...
I'm sorry, sir, but as far as I'm concerned, there's nothin' needed for space travel that this old girl doesn't already have.
Aye, sir!
Precautionary, Mr. Chekov. Shields up...
Oh, God, sir, I dinna think so...
It's been a while, sir. Here we go... Retrothrusters!
My friends, the great experiment: Excelsior, ready for trial runs...
No, Jim! Enterprise would never stand the pounding.
Any time.
All right, damn you! All right!  Give me a minute to inform my crew.
No tricks. I'm looking forward to meeting you. Kirk out.
He would not have spoken of it openly.
You will find a way, Kirk. If you honor them both, you <U>must</U>.
I am not sure. Only time will answer.  Kirk. I thank you. What you have done is --
What I have done, I had to do.
Great power... to control... dominate... destroy. If it works.
They know we would die first.

Our mission is over. I have failed... A human has been bolder and more ruthless than I...  That -- is the real dishonor.
It would destroy such life in favor of its new matrix --
From yourself, Admiral.
I got beat. We're only alive because I knew something about these ships that he didn't.
It's like the Garden of Eden...
We each face death every day we're alive, Saavik.
The order comes from Starfleet command, Dr. Marcus, direct from the General Staff.
Maybe...
Never mind! Hurry!
Umm. And would Admiral Kirk have access to such information?
So am I. My friends were killed, too.
Locking phasers on target.
... to prevent an enemy from doing just what we're attempting; using <u>our</u> console to tap in a message, an order to lower Reliant's damn shields...
Listen to me -- you men and women --
Try the emergency channels...
Scotty, let's have it.
Admiral, if we go by the book, like Lieutenant Saavik, hours could seem like days.
Midshipman First Class Peter Preston, engineers mate, SIR.
Oh do you? Have you any idea, Midshipman Preston, how many times I've had to listen to Mr. Scott on the Comm, telling me his troubles? Have you any idea the ribbing I've had to endure in the officers' mess to the effect that the Enterprise is a flying death trap?
The <u>Kobayshi Maru</u> scenario frequently wreaks havoc with students and equipment.  As I recall you took the test three times yourself. Your final solution was, shall we say, unique?
Welcome aboard, Admiral. I believe you know my trainee crew. Certainly they have come to know you.
I would not presume to debate you.
The power of creation --
It would explain a great many things --
Visual!  Mr. Sulu, divert everything to the phasers --
It's all we've got.
... Blind as a Tiberian Bat. What do you make of the plantoid beyond?
In my quarters, Uhura.
Yes, sir.
Very well.
HURRY.
I reprogrammed the simulation so it was possible to rescue the ship.
Then -- you never faced that situation -- faced death...
They just don't want us going in there.
Understood, sir.
Scotty!
Best guess, Mr. Sulu. Fire when ready.
I'll try, Captain.
Never, sir.
Where must you go?
I know. I feel the same thing. But we're between a rock and a hard place. We can't keep them without risking their lives and we can't let them go without a taking the same chance.
Please...
What do you mean?
If you have a better idea - now's the time.
Captain Spock and I will attempt to trace these whale songs to their source.
Well nobody's perfect...
Captain, their call is being carried on an amplification wave of enormous power!
Like what?
The top of what?
Name?
I do not know your name.
Communicate? Communicate what? You have no right to be here!
To put it mildly. Since the dawn of time, men have harvested whales for a variety of purposes, most of which can be achieved synthetically at this point. A hundred years ago, using hand-thrown harpoons, they did plenty of damage -- but that was nothing compared to what they've achieved in this century.
Soon... It's too bad because they're very friendly as you can see. I've grown quite attached to them... This way.
LDS?? Are you dyslexic on top of everything else? Come on, Lemme give you a lift. I have a notorious weakness for hard luck cases -- that's why I work with whales.
Tell me when the whales are going to be released?
It wouldn't be my first choice, no.
Lemme tell you something. I'm here to bring two humpbacks into the 23rd Century. If I have to, I'll go to the open sea to get them, but I'd just as soon take yours -- better for me, better for you... and better for them.
Yes... And I'm glad you're here. Though I'll admit, you picked a hellova time to drop in...
But Kirk...
... Damn!
He means our chances of getting home are not very good. You might have lived a longer life if you'd stayed where you belong.
Well, I... find that understandable  I mean, you've been through a lot.  Station, please.
Nuclear power was widely used in naval vessels...
The hell I can't
How will playing cards help?
Damn.... Damnit! We've been so lucky. We have the two perfect whales in our hands, but if we don't move quickly, we'll lose them!
Continue on course. Chekov, any signs of Federation escort?
Picture, please.
Wing to cruise configuration... Full impulse power.
Picture, Uhura!
Ground cushion! Keep the nose up if you can --
Everyone remember where we parked.
Nothing... I should never have left him...
Uhura!... Where!
How long, Scotty?
You will be in good hands here.
Yes, Admiral.  Sir. I have not had the opportunity to tell you about your son.  David died most bravely. He saved Spock. He saved us all... I thought you should know.
... But it would take years just to figure out the dynamics of this matrix...!
Old, yes. But interesting.  Do you mind if I ask a few questions...?
They are my friends.
There are days.
Seeing my home planet from space for the first time...
You've brought the Federation into the middle of a blood feud, Admiral. The children have returned to expel their elders... just as they were once expelled. Except Ru'afo's need for revenge has now escalated to parricide.
No, I mean...
Until this week, that young man probably never saw a  machine, let alone one that walks and talks...
It is clearly Federation in origin, Captain.
What you're seeing is a computer driven image created by photons and forcefields...
What kind of concerns?
Sir, Commander Worf and I have been working on several tactical plans to safely...
The Prime Directive doesn't apply. These people are not indigenous to this world. They were never meant to be immortal. We'll simply be restoring their natural evolution.
Our partners are nothing more than petty thugs.
Do you know how to disable the injector?
Recommendations?
In a sense, that's all he knew. The system is designed to protect him against anyone who might try to take advantage of his memory loss.
And yet he attacked us. And told the Ba'ku we were a threat...
It may not last after we leave. If not, I just wanted, before we go...  I've never actually seen a sunrise.
Eject the core.
If it works you mean.
As you wish. But I would ask you to disarm yourselves. This village is a sanctuary of life.
We'll skip the court martial this time... Picard out.
Yes... yes, I... can hear you...
The metaphasic radiation in those rings is in a state of extreme flux. Steer clear of them, Mister Worf...
Evasive maneuvers... heading one- four-zero mark three-one...
Transferring controls to manual.
Negative. He's established a security field around the control room...
What are they interested in...?
If that's true, they're a dying race.
... I'm not sleeping well...
On this ship, anything can happen. And usually does.
I'm saying they might shoot us on sight. You have to remember... these people have watched their entire way of life collapse around them.
If they're not... we'd better get used to living in Montana.
I'm a little worried about some of these bone fragments. If they move any closer to the brain, we could be looking at a hemorrhage.
That's because you haven't been properly... stimulated yet.
What a cold description... for such a beautiful gift.
They're not your friends... they've held you back... kept you from your destiny...
Have they given you what I have given you? Did they even try?
Yes... but the Enterprise... my duty...
No.
What?
According to our astrometric readings... the year is 2063.
Today is March second, 2063. The time in Montana is oh-eight-forty- five.
Not very well. We met shortly after the Enterprise-E was commissioned. I found her to be a most... promising officer.
Where?
Understood. Keep me informed.
How serious is the damage?
I have the password right here.
There should be some kind of manual release...
Phoenix to control.  Initiating five minute countdown... mark.
It'll have to wait. Come on.
Well, I feel a whole lot better with them out there. We may need some help.
What about our warp signature? It has to be strong enough for them to detect.
Well, with any luck... the Vulcans will land outside Resurrection tomorrow morning... and Earth will never be the same again.
Active.
Lieutenant, actually. Lieutenant Jonathan Scrimm. I'm the head of the Resurrection Protective Force.  And you are?
It wasn't a trick. I used to be an electrical engineer.
Lucky for him you came by when you did. He might be dead now.
We're trying to repair Doctor Cochrane's ship. It's been damaged and --
And all I'm asking for is the truth. That would take five minutes.  For all I know, you caused the explosions at the silo... and now you're trying to steal Zephram's ship.
It's the future, isn't it? Just like you told Scrimm.  I knew you weren't from around here.
No... I'm from France.
I don't care if you're from France or Venus... just take me with you.
This may be hard for you to understand... but I'm duty-bound not to interfere with you, or anyone else here... any more than is absolutely necessary.
You've been interfering with my life ever since I met you.  Don't stop now.
We have to follow them back... repair whatever damage they've done to that time-line.
Fire.
Phasers are off-line... we have two quantum torpedoes left. But the computer targeting system has been destroyed.
Fire!
Unless you'd like to stay.
Just a little queasy...
Deflector dish... why the deflector dish...?
Something is very wrong, Commander. We're falling back.
What kind of message?
Vulcans sleep lying down...
Jim, I don't even know his anatomy.
What's the Brotherhood of Aliens?
I didn't mean this future.
Some people ARE afraid of the future; of what MIGHT happen;  I was frightened, really frightened.
Well, don't be too hard on yourself - we all felt exactly the same -
Still think we're finished?
Don't remind me.
And perhaps with a large step or two. Like a peace treaty.
I beg your pardon?
There... were no other ships in the sector.
I have on occasion disobeyed orders.
Torpedo bay! DID we fire those torpedoes?
Shields up. Battle stations.
Aye, sir; thrusters...
Second star to the right - and straight on till morning...
Are you kidding?  Send to Starfleet Command...
Thank you, Captain.
Don't you know? Everyone on Rura Penthe is here for life.
Where do we come in?
I can't make it alone. You're the likeliest candidate to come to this god-forsaken place in months.
Candidate for what?
Stand DOWN, Mr. Scott. All stop. That's an order.
Thank you. Lieutenant, one quarter impulse power...
I'm still in the chair, Lieutenant.
I won't allow Starfleet to be dismantled over some Klingon promises.
Sulu!
I'm telling you. Hang on.  How many of those things are there? Come on, Lieutenant, you're charged with murder...
You have personally -
How could you vouch for me? That's...  ... arrogant presumption -
I'M going. You are going to be responsible for getting me out of this. Meantime we're not going to be the instigators of a full-scale war on the eve of universal peace.
Not yet... Section 4236...
Who else?
Faith...?
Commander Uhura has been experiencing technical difficulties sir.
I'm having the garbage searched. If my surmise is correct these boots will cling to the killers' necks like Tiberian bats. They couldn't make their escape without them; nor can they simply throw them out a window for all to see; no - they're here. Somewhere.
I don't want to.
You can't prove any of this...
Confirmed, Captain!
Apparently they're refusing to acknowledge signal to return to spacedock, sir.
No, sir.
Negative. The subspace shockwave originated at bearing three-two- three, mark seven-five, the location is...  Praxis. A Klingon moon. Barren of indigenous life forms but -
What is it?
What's left of it.
There was an enormous neutron energy surge.
Would they?
Yes, sir.
He's placing himself in a most awkward position...
I was taken from my homeworld by people called the "PakJeds." They are fat. They traded me to a ship belonging to the "Bolians." The "Bolians" are blue. They put me in a seat and asked me questions. Then they were attacked by another ship...
Yes, please continue.
No. Can I move now?
It'll serve you right.
To happy endings.
On my way.
Port thrusters, sir. Would you like me to drive?
We're about to find out... Power up disruptors and fire on my mark.
Ready, Captain.
I feel nothing, Geordi. It is my belief that with my memory engrams he will be able to function as a more complete individual.
It seems to be a redundant memory port.  Maybe it's for provisional memory storage in case his neural pathways overload?
The B-9 is like a slow child, sir. And Data, in his own way, has assumed the position of a parent or guardian. I'm afraid he has expectations based on his own experiences. He'll be disappointed when the BI-9 cannot meet those expectations.
Captain, don't assume he's anything like you are. You should resist the urge to think you know him.
Permission denied. If you can possibly endure any more of these assaults.  I need you at my side. Now more than ever I...
Uncharted. We'll have to get closer for a more detailed scan.
Theories?
What do we know about the population?
Then how did a Reman get to be Praetor? I don't get it.
There's something else. I was reviewing the sensor logs.
Aye, sir.
A diplomatic mission. We've been invited, believe it or not. Seems there's been some kind of internal political shakeup. The new Praetor, someone called Shinzon, has requested a Federation envoy.
Not with the Romulans.
I'm preparing her for Shinzon. To sooth him as she soothes you. To stand at his side as she does at yours.
What sort of signature?
If you don't mind.
Fifty-two disruptor banks, twenty-seven photon torpedo bays, primary and secondary phased shields.
Captain's prerogative, Will. There's no foreseeable danger... and your wife would never forgive me if anything happened to you.
Acknowledged ...  ...I'll talk to Data.
Can anything be done for him?
I intend to.
Yes.
You know I need to verify this.
You'll acquire a taste for it.
You're doing this to liberate the Remans?
I see a young man trying desperately to deny who he is.
And what of the Enterprise?
Not so long.
I have no choices! I can't fight what I am!
And?
But surely...
I don't see anything.
Have a nice trip.
How much are your rooms?
Eh... yes.
No.
No.
It is beautiful.
Thank you.
He's got a gun!!
We've been back and forth on this all day and keeping in mind the panic that would occur if this got to the general public, it's been decided not to expand the search at this time.
Don't let them do it this way, George. It's too important. We can't find this thing alone.
You have to. We're trying to contact the ship. If we do, I'll let you know immediately. Good luck.
It's taken on a disguise.
Clarify that.
Oh shit!!!
Dammit Shermin. Earlier you were asking for help. What's changed?
I don't care where you're from you just can't disappear into thin air.
You just do your job, Shermin. We'll make the policy.
Watch it. They're coming out.
That way.
Coupons.
No. I don't know what you are, but you're not Scott.
No.
You. Mouth closed.
Okay.
I...
I won't tell anybody if that's what you're worried about. I promise. You'll keep...
I feel like I'm going crazy here. You're Scott. But he's dead. I don't know what's real anymore. I can't be here with you.
I can't... Forget the baby. Okay? The closest I was able to get you was Lathrop Wells. You'll have to hitchhike the rest of the way.
I do not speak English.
It was a mistake.
Do they talk?!
It will be human and it will look like this.  But when it comes it will know everything I know and everything you know. That is something from my planet that I want your baby to have.
We can.
Hey buddy... let her go...
My grandmother's rich.
Why wouldn't he want to go through the roadblock?... What did you guys do?... I won't tell anybody.
Don't worry. I'll be all right.
Get Fox.
Bullshit!
People have made mistakes in these situations before.
It was a man though... right?
Hey, it's none of my business why you're chasing a retard... You want my opinion, it's the girl. She had to hold the guy's hand all the way to the car like he was a kid.
Bullshit politics.
He doesn't know what's going on. Leave him alone.
Maybe later.
I know.  I don't always do exactly what I'm told.  So I said, 'Do you enjoy watching me?'  And you said -- come on Max.
Watch and see.
I know you Faith.  You're afraid of something.  What's going on?
Let it alone, Lenny.  It'll take care of itself.
Faith, we know about Jeriko.  Iris made me a copy of the tape.
We should talk alone.
I'll set you up, get you a deck at my cost... since my thing is the software.
What kind of things exactly?
Exactly anything.  Whatever you want.  Whoever you want to be.  Fabri, get us another round, would you.
This tie cost more than your entire wardrobe.
It's the one thing that stands between me and the jungle.
Uh unh, carrying a gun wrecks the line of a fine jacket.
I'm on her.
Come on, Lenny.  You used to be good at this stuff.  Play it down. What's the perp doing?
He stalks her.  He rapes her.  Then he does her...
Is he dead?
Okay... what about Strickland?
This is what we laughingly refer to as a plan, right?
Come on!  If he gives us any shit, we kill 'em all.  Whattya say?  Just get your butt down here.  If I'm not at the shindig downstairs go to the room.  It's 2203.  You writin'?
Where's Faith?
Way I look at it, I actually perform a humanitarian service.  I save lives.
Okay, take some executive... bored with his life, bored with his wife... he picks up a hooker or some girl at a bar.  Then he goes around for months, torn up worrying that he's got AIDS, that he'll infect his wife.  And maybe he really does catch something--
Everybody needs to take a walk to the dark end of the street sometime, it's what we are.  But now the risks are outa line.  The streets are a war zone.  And sex can kill you.  So you slip on the trodes, you get what you need and it keeps you from jumping your tracks.
Coming with you.
Lenny, you're turning into some kinda squid-head low-life.  You're always broke, you just go from one score to the next.  And you're getting strung out... you don't even see it.  Getting high on your own supply like some crack dealer.
Begging?  Groveling?  Any pathetic behavior at all?  Will that help? Faith's there tonight, and I've got to talk to her.
What I'm saying.  But you still come out this goofball romantic.
If he could do what's on that tape, he's a sicko.
It's in my case.  Okay?  I'm going to open my case...
Take it easy.  The glass is bullet resistant.
Lenny.  Calm down.  This is what I do.
I can't tell you.  You've got to see.
You know what this tape could do if it gets out.
I've got a good idea, yeah.
It was a tough call.
But she was different.  There was a light in her eyes... and she had this voice.  It was scary, all that pain coming out of that little body. Like she could take all the hurt and rage of the entire world and lift it up to heaven in one voice.  I helped her.  And I promised her that I'd always be there... to protect her.  See?  It's not about what's in her head.  It's what's in mine.  I can't let go of the promise.  It's... like... it's all I have left.
No, it's not.
I still got one ace to play.  Tran's got what I want... and I've got what he wants...
Yeah, well maybe it's time for a war!
Excuse me, a salesman gets done in his car and you call the FBI?
What's the bad news?
Tape it off, we'll want to fine-tooth- comb it. My guess is that the UNSUB is having us on. He checks in, pays, picks up the key, but never walks inside. Tell me if I'm wrong.
Hi there.
The body was embalmed. I don't understand --
Turn the body over. There was something in the autopsy report, yes, here.  These burn marks.
Yeah.
Look...
Oh God, mister, please leave me alone.
You're going to miss it. Pay attention.
Yes.
Nada. Vague description, that's all. Fine-tooth-combed Speck's car, the diner: no fingerprints, no trace evidence.
Serial killer killed. In Ft. Myers. Cut up in his van. And this time we got a witness.
They don't know how to crack these secret chat rooms --
You refused to comply with a direct order.
Its called insubordination.
If my Reporting Agent could be someone outside Computer Crimes, perhaps Agent Kulok?
Okay, Harold Speck: who goes first?
I can't. The chat room isn't open for another five days.
Suspect Zero, now there's an idea that doesn't look good on paper --
What about the chat rooms themselves?
That's the beauty of the system. This is a fugitive chat room. It moves from place to place, chat rooms that are normally empty at certain hours: a gardening website, Chaucer buffs, a dating service. A pre- arranged code shows up in one of fifty porn rooms -- that's where I stumbled across it -- notifying "friends" to meet at a certain time, usually midnight to three Eastern Standard, at a certain website -- a deserted chat room, say, "How to Plant Perennials." Come Tuesday, twelve a.m., bingo, these like-minded deviates log on and start yakking it up: explicit sex crime gossip, who did what to whom, who wants to do what, when, why and how.
No, no, no, most of them -- I used to think all of them -- are just fantasists, guys who get off telling degrading stories. When I came across this fugitive chat room, listened in, I started to think some might actually be real, that they'd gone live. The challenge was to figure out which was which. Then I had my disagreement with Koessler.
Sex.
I was thinking, maybe we should ask Professor Daitz. Nobody knows this stuff better.
No, Mack, I do not think you're a square and definitely not a nerd.
"Intra-Agency fraternizing."
What's that?
Slow down a second, you met with Low --
All the same killer?
Zero abducts victims all over the country, kills them, keeps them refrigerated for days, weeks, even months, then buries them hundreds, thousands of miles away. Karen Sumpter was buried, washed up in a flood. Evans was buried. When we get Zero, we'll find boneyards all across the country.
Yes, sir.
He couldn't break an egg with a hammer. He still writing those crime porn books?
Daitz hinted it existed. It was a matter of forming the request in the proper terms.
[Follow me.]
[The address is 147 South Rane. It's a lively address. You got a problem with dark meat?]
Not everything is imputed to memory. The most confidential stuff is kept top secret hard copy. Why would the Zero file be kept secret?
[And I want to go back to Needlepoint.]
I see that. Washington to Philadelphia to here. Philly's a nice station. How many agents?
I like working for the Bureau, sir. I like catching bad guys. It's all I care about.
I talked to him.
Murman!
He's a brilliant man. Brilliant enough to catch you.
Brilliant? You think he caught any of them because he was brilliant? Hardboy? MyDick? Imelda? Ripper? Think about it, how did he locate them?  He found them as Murman. And how did Murder Man find them? With sweet talk and brains? No. He did it with souvenirs. He took them into private rooms, swapped goodies: pictures, panties, jewelry, body parts. Snuff downloads. As bait. That's why I never exchanged with him. He killed girls, oh yeah, harvested them. He had the best stuff. Richard Low is Murman and Murman is one of us.
It didn't feel that way.
No. Stop, come on.
Shut up.
I'm sorry?
You're a comedian?
What's that like?
Probably a little longer than that, but, whatever.
Nikki.
Thank you, Nikki.
Well, I left someone very special behind.
It does.
How?
You don't think the guy would find me attractive enough to dance with?
Mike...
No thanks. Why ruin a perfect night.
Uh, I don't want to bet it all.
Oh? You know about booking agents... I don't, uh, actually have a west coast agent as of yet...
...Yeah, but entertainment law isn't something you just jump into...
...home. It's getting late. Yeah.
I can call back...
Yeah?
Yeah.
...the Michelin commercial...
Right.
There's the rub.
What do you want? You're tall.
Oh no?
What do you have? A Pluto call back?
I got to at least try once.
You're a better man than I am, Charlie Brown.
Give me the money. I'll get it.
...People get carjacked...
We ran into them that night at Roscoe's. Tee cleared it up, I apologized, bought them some chicken and waffles. They fuckin love Tee. That boy can talk.
Nikki! Great! Did you just walk in, or were you listening all along?
Trent, I don't feel like going out tonight. I got shit to do tomorrow...
What are you wearing? I mean, we should wear suits.
Twenty... but I was down at least fifty. I'm sorry, I got hot at the crap table.
You gotta give Tee one thing. He's good with the ladies.
You can't think like that, baby. It's hard, I know. I've been there. Not for six years, but I know. You just gotta get back out there.
We didn't do so bad after all.
Well... we're not in Kansas anymore.
No!
I just don't think she liked me in that way.
Baby, you're so money you don't even know it.
I just need some time...
...Whatever. It's work. You're doing what you love. What's she doing?
What?
No, baby!
No.
Is she looking now?
Damn. Now I gotta go in early.
...you're so fuckin mmmoney.
...Whatever. Things are different here. It's not like New York, Mikey.
...it is so on.
...Okay, two...
And what is that Bonasera?
Good.  From me you'll get Justice.
Some day, and that day may never come, I would like to call upon you to do me a service in return.
I'm not hungry yet.
Like hell I will.
That's all?  Don't you want me to send some people over here?
Maybe less...
What are you, a dance judge?  Go do your job; take a walk around the neighborhood... see everything is okay.
Thirty per cent.  In the first year your share would be four million dollars; then it would go up.
And what is the percentage of the Tattaglia family?
Are you worried about security for your million?
The Tattaglias will guarantee your investment also.
You understand him better than anyone.
Good.  When you are finished, come and talk to me.  I have hopes for you.
How did you find out?
I'll need him.
Yes.
Is that why there are more men on the walls?
Even so, I don't think it is safe here anymore.  I've made plans to move you to a villa near Siracuse. You must go right away.
Only the son of a Pezzonovanta.
You look good, too.
No.
Okay.  One minute.
We're all tired...
We should hear what they have to say.
No no, no more advice on how to patch it up Tom.  You just help me win.  Understood?
Nobody knows where he is.  We know he's all right, but that's all.
Even Sonny won't be able to call off Luca Brasi.
I'll worry about Luca.  You take care of Sonny and the other two kids.
I'll try...It's what the Don would want us to do.
You smooth son of a bitch, let me lay it on the line for you, and your boss.  Johnny Fontane never gets that movie.  I don't care how many Dago, Guinea, wop Greaseball Goombahs come out of the woodwork!
Okay my Kraut-Mick friend, Johnny will never get that part because I hate that pinko punk and I'm going to run him out of the Movies.  And I'll tell you why.  He ruined one of Woltz Brothers' most valuable proteges.  For five years I had this girl under training; singing lessons!  Acting lessons!  Dancing lessons!  We spent hundreds of thousands of dollars--I was going to make her a star.  I'll be even more frank, just to show you that I'm not a hard-hearted man, that it wasn't all dollars and cents.  That girl was beautiful and young and innocent and she was the greatest piece of ass I've ever ad and I've had them all over the world.  Then Johnny comes along with that olive oil voice and guinea charm and she runs off.  She threw it all away to make me look ridiculous.  A MAN IN MY POSITION CANNOT AFFORD TO BE MADE TO LOOK RIDICULOUS!
No.  I guess I'll see you Christmas. Everyone's going to be out at Long Beach, right?
Yes.  Tell me.
Michael, I love you.
My brother Sonny found him living in the streets when he was a kid, so my father took him in.  He's a good lawyer.
I'm thinking about it.
Michael...
Can I go to the hospital with you?
When will I see you again?
Goodbye.
We'll go to the show tomorrow night--we can change the tickets.
Wake me up when you come to bed?
Is it true?
You and I are going to move my father right now...to another room on another floor...Can you disconnect those tubes so we can wheel the bed out?
One of them fingered the old man.
Just be patient.
I think so.  Detective squad?
Is he alive?
Sure. Any time.
Did you forget where I live? It's four o'clock.
I just woke up. I'm sorry.
No, I like him.
Oh darling -- is that for me?
It's Tom. Tom Ripley. We were at Princeton together.
Princeton is like a fog, America's like a fog.  This is Marge Sherwood. Tom -- sorry, what was it?
Jazz, let's face it, it's just an insolent noise.
It's got nothing to do with my mother! She's had leukemia for -- ! This is what makes me boil about him! HE wants me back! -- it's got nothing to do with my mother.
I don't know, Dickie, I'm just telling you what I --
I love jazz.
What time is it?  Oh God! Do you always type your letters?  That should be two Ts.
I have to go to Venice.
Do you ski?  Don't tell me -- you're a lost cause! That's the next thing to deal with. We're planning to go to Cortina at Christmas. Excellent skiing. Excellent.  Marge -- Ripley can't ski. We'll have to teach him that, too. Have you ever known such low class?
It must be a deep secret, cause I don't know about it.
I love how responsible you are. My Dad should make you Chief Accountant or something. Let me buy you a jacket. There's a great place when we get to Rome, Batistoni.
Freddie's arranged it with some of the skiing crowd. Come if you want but I thought you wanted to see the Forum...?
Get undressed in your own room, would you?
She came to me for help, she needed money, and I didn't help her. I didn't help her. Now she's dead and it's my fault.
I'm not going to say anything -- to Marge, or anybody, the police -- It's a secret between us and I'll keep it.
I thought you might write again. Now that we're brothers...
Oh God, I don't think so.
Marge and I are getting married.
I'm actually a little relieved you're going, to be honest. I think we've seen enough of each other for a while.
Sure -- I know, that's too dangerous for you, fair enough, hey! we're brothers, fine, then you do this sordid thing with Marge, fucking her on the boat while we all have to listen, which was excruciating, frankly, plus you follow your cock around like a -- and now you're getting married! I'm bewildered, forgive me... you're lying to Marge then getting married to her, you're knocking up Silvana, you've got to play sax, you've got to play drums, which is it, Dickie, what do you really play?
Because he's been hiding from me -- what happened at Christmas?
In fact the only thing which looks like Dickie is you.
What? I think I'm saying it. Something's going on. He's either converted to Christianity -- or to something else.
Is it on "delle Croce, just off the Corso"? You're a quick study, aren't you? Last time you didn't know your ass from your elbow, now you're giving me directions. That's not fair, you probably do know your ass from your elbow. I'll see you.
Tom. How are you? You look well.
Far cry from New York.
Well, if we all pushed him away what about him pushing us away? You've been a great friend to my son. Everything is someone else's fault. We all want to sow wild oars. Somebody's got to -- what's the word?  The moment someone confronts him he lashes out. He lashes out. You know, people always say you can't choose your parents, but you can't choose your children.
You know I feel ridiculous I didn't mention them yesterday -- I clean forgot -- ridiculous.
No, he should talk to you alone.
Thanks, yes, I think we did.
Mr Ripley? I'm Alvin MacCarron.
What's going on?
My fiance.
He's not even aware of it. When you've got his attention you feel like you're the only person in the world. That's why everybody loves him. Other times...
He's having an early night.
Shut up! Shut up!
Why? When?
I don't believe a single word you've said.
You were at the Opera? Well, that explains -- yes I was there. I was there with Dickie.
Marge, I don't know you, so I have no right, but Dickie loves you. He's -- I think you'll find he's coming home to you.
That's why Tom wanted you to stay. It's better than squeezing into my room, and I know how you hate hotels.
No, it's just -- you are American, aren't you? -- no, I just, I have so much luggage, and you're so, uh, streamlined. It's humiliating.
As in the...?
What?
You're crazy! It's freezing out there.
Beating you away.
I was looking at you, your clothes, I wouldn't have known you...
What?
Where are you hiding him? He's impossible, isn't he?
Hi.  Sorry. You okay? You look as if you've seen a ghost...
You've seen the papers, you know what a big deal it's been here. American tourist murdered --
Tell him I have a fiance, Dickie has a fiance and Freddie Miles probably had a string of them.
Probably. In my case it's probably a whole building.
Do you want me to stick around?
I give up.
I don't know. Both. My plan right now is to go up on deck, look at the sunset. Come with me.
Was who Meredith?
Inspector Roverini. Can we come in?
So Signor Miles drove away and you did what?
Of course. What happened to your face?
A few days ago.
Does he stay with you here?
May I ask... why would you speak to your friend and not your fiance?
I want a .32. Revolver. And a palm gun. That .22 there.
The .32's $150 -- and you're really getting a good deal now -- and all together it comes to, ah, seven eighty- five for four pieces and a holster. Hell, I'll give you the holster, we'll make it seventy-five and you've got a deal -- a good one.
Nah, this'll be fine.
Vietnam? I saw it on your jacket. Where were you? Bet you got to handle a lot of weapons out there.
Oh, I think he's a wonderful man. Make a great, great President.
If you don't mind, mam, I'd be mighty pleased if you'd go out and have some coffee and pie with me.
All right.  All right. I'm taking a break at four o'clock. If you're here then we'll go to the corner and have some coffee and pie.
If it wasn't for a drunk I would have picked you up. He wanted to go to the DMZ.
Well, no... not really... had some famous people in the cab.  I got this guy who makes lasers. Not regular lasers, not the big kind. Little lasers, pocket sized, small enough to clip your belt like a transistor radio, like a gun, you know. Like a ray gun. Zap.
But this is a porno movie.
You mean these are the only kind of movies you go to?
Keep it.
Just didn't get around to it, huh?
No. I just wanted to see if you could light it that way. The guy at the newsstand can.
No, I'm serious, really...
That's a dollar forty-seven.
Yeah.
The cops and company raise hell they find out.
I never use mine. But it's a good thing to have. Just as a threat.
One-Ball McCall?
But that one night?
No, I mean really. This is nothing for a person to do.
Sure. All right. We'll have breakfast. I get up about one o'clock. Tomorrow.
But you can't live like this. It's hell. Girls should live at home.
At least I don't walk the streets like a skunk pussy. I don't screw and fuck with killers and junkies.
That fella "Sport" looks like a killer to me.
Huh?
He looks like a killer.
I don't know. Just should, though.  Somebody should kill 'em. Nobody'd miss 'em.
I'm sure you'll win, sir. Everybody I know is going to vote for you.  I was going to put one of your stickers on my taxi but the company said it was against their policy.
I was in the Army too.  And I'm good with crowds.
I saw. $20 fifteen minutes. $30 half hour.
Take it or leave it.
How are things in the pimp business, hey Sport?
No.  Hillbilly, you'd better get your wise ass outa here and quick, or you're gonna be in trouble.
You fit in. It's lonely, it's rough at first. But you fit in. You got no choice.
Thanks.
You want to talk about it?
Shit, shit, shit what time is it.  Hello.  I'll be downstairs in ten minutes.
Name your vacation spot, Goodspeed. The Bureau'll pay for it.
For cottonmouth. Goodspeed and the S.E.A.L.s exchange looks.
Wrong.
I'm not a fool, Billy.
The truth is, I'm a lot of things, but communist isn't one of them.
But if you only went to one meeting, why does anyone care? Besides, why should it even matter if you were a communist?
I wish you were coming with me.
Damn...
Well...
Dad... 
No, I... I just wondering where you've been all this time.
Yeah, a little.  I think you grew an inch or so.  And you've lost weight.
You... don't remember, but yes, ever since I was a little girl.
Yes.  Hic!
I'm  fine.  Really.  
We've done this before, so many times.  The last time was so long ago, but it feels like yesterday.
Yeah, and needless to say, none of us has that kind of money lying around.
... he started practicing, and he left me alone from then on.
Exactly.  And he got good.
It never used to be.  You were two left feet on the dance floor.  Like pulling teeth to get you to do a little box step.
Well, I'm sure we're all glad to see you came through it all right.
Referring to line thirty-seven of the document, does your printed name and signature appear there?
Yes it does.
Mr. Clyde, do you want to know what I knew then, or do you want to know what I know now?  They're two different things?
Well, I know that I lost my job because of one meeting I went to when I was a kid in college.  I know that I've been branded a communist, which I'm not, but even if I was, it shouldn't matter, or what do we have a Bill Of Rights for?
I'll do my best, Mr. Chairman.
Now, we're informed that you have a statement you'd like to read, is that correct?
A statement?
I... I need a drink of water.
Go ahead, son.
Ben, when's Delly due back?
By all means.
Shhhhhh.
Exactly.  Break it to her gently.
Well, this place sorta reminds me of something.
Luke, I'm hopping you can help him see the reality of the situation. I'll come to the point.  I want to buy the property, and I'm prepared to offer six-thousand dollars for it.  And that's just for the property, mind you.  If you want, I'll leave it to you and your father to dismantle and liquidate the building for whatever salvage value it has, and you keep those proceeds.  I just want the land.
Ah.
Why?
Oh, hi Cue... Carl.  Sorry.
You two have a lot of catching up to do, I guess.
Six-thirty.  I thought we'd get an early start.
Did you fix the damn film?  It broke in the last reel.
We live in a theater?
Oh, you mean the suit.  Harry kept all my old clothes.  Fits okay, but it's a little big.
Can we get him to the hospital?
Take a hike.  Am-scray.
They know you were at that meeting, Peter.  They've been told, and they know.
Peter, I believe in you.  More to the point, I read your new script... um...
That's the one, "Ashes To Ashes." I think it's great.  But it'll never get made with this communist business hanging over your head. You can't work until you're cleared -- and believe me, starting right now, I'm gonna do everything I can to make that happen.
So it doesn't make any difference that I'm not one now, and have never been one.
Leo, I didn't give them the names. I wouldn't do that.
Oh god, oh, god, no, I...
Cat.
Cat.  That's simple.  I like it.  Hi, Cat.
Thanks.
My name isn't Luke.  It's Peter. Peter Appleton.
That you got let go.
Actually, it's none of my business.
Thank you.
Yes, I did.
I suspected as much.
Four years ago. Of course, that was shortly after his father died.  Things may be different now.
Nothing! I simply existed. So what was the answer? A jealous woman, right? A clinging possessive mother.  Wrong. With all due respect to Oedipus, I don't think that was the case at all.
No, I don't think so. She's not afraid of losing her son, you see.  She's only afraid of being abandoned.
Someone ought to tell her she'd be gaining a daughter.
I see.
It seems so pointless.  I think I'll go to sleep. This has been a busy day.  My luggage.
In a democracy, Cathy, everyone is entitled to a fair trial. Your brother's practice...
If your father were here...
No!
Well, I suppose...
Don't you like us?
I guess it does get a little hectic at times.
If you do decide to come, don't say I told you about it. It's supposed to be a surprise party.
The little Brenner girl.
Yep.
I need her exact name, you see.
The crow is a permanent resident throughout its range. In fact, during our Christmas Count, we recorded...
Young woman cut herself.
Shall I call the doctor?
They're back!
One apple pie! You want more coffee?
Across at Brinkmeyer's.
Miss Daniels is staying for the weekend. In fact, I've already invited her to dinner tonight.
And certainly pretty.
I suppose so. Her father owns a big newspaper in San Francisco.
You'd think he could manage to keep her name out of print. She's always mentioned in the columns, Mitch.
Yes, Mother.
Mother?
When?
You don't know, you don't know! When will you know? When we're all dead? Like Annie?
I keep seeing Dan Fawcett's face.  They have such big windows at the school.  All the windows were broken. In Dan's bedroom. All the windows.
Would you like to rest now, Mrs. Brenner.
Because my son is...  My son seems to be fond of you.  And I...  I'm not quite sure how I feel about it. I really don't know if I... like you or not.
Would you like me to go for her?
I'll just clear up here, and then dress.
Not by the thousands.
What are we going to do about it, Al?
My wife found a bird in the back seat of her car once.
I said I wonder if you could help me.
Lovebirds.
Yes, we call them that too.  Ahhh, here we are, Lovebirds... 
Doesn't what make me...?
All these innocent little creatures caged up like this?
I imagine that's very important. Especially during the moulting season.
Ahhh, but I know you.
We met in court.
Criminal.
I loathe you. You have no manners. And you're arrogant and conceited and... I wrote you a letter about it, in fact, but I tore it up.
Certainly, but...
Of course, how stupid of me. A quarter to seven, will that be all right?
What?
Mmmm. I like to swim. We might get along very...
In case you're interested, I was pushed into that fountain.
...the opinions of others, and you went right along with them, isn't that the truth?
I told you what happened in Rome!
I'm trying to get you to stay for dinner. We're going to have a lot of roast left over.
Cheers.
Nothing.  I go to bird shops on Fridays.
Yes.
I... I am.  Mitch, is... Mitch, this isn't usual, is it? The gull yesterday when I was in the boat, and the one last night at Annie's, and now...
Last night? What do you mean?
I don't know, Melanie.  Look, do you have to go back to Annie's?
Then stay and have something to eat before you start back. I'd feel a lot better.
It's hard to believe anything at all happened yesterday, isn't it? It's so beautiful and still now.  I think I've got it all figured out, by the way.
Growing a beard...
Why should we submit ourselves to their domination?
It was like that yesterday.
What do you mean?
No, no...
Melanie...
At Annie's house. She's all right.
How long have they been gathering there?
Have we still got power?
Maybe.
You must be exhausted.
No... wait.  Hold me.
I... I don't think so. If we get through town, I think we'll be all right.
And he'll talk?
Yes.
Yes.  Oh my, I suppose I should call them again. They said three o'clock.  Maybe it's the traffic. I'll call. Would you mind waiting?
...insist on making it difficult for life to survive on this planet. If it weren't for birds...
I hardly think a few birds are going to bring about the end of the world.
These weren't a few birds.
No one ever said you were, Mitch.
If you don't even know what you want to do...
With smoke.
Yeah, birds. All they do is make a mess of everything. Who needs them?
They are incapable of organized warfare!
Of course.
Can't you please finish your drink?
I'm cold as ice.
They did not tell you how that porter cried out in the witness box when the Kings Counselor pressed him hard -- how he cried out that he was shielding a gentleman of consequence.
So she told me.  I'm a teacher -- not a practitioner.
You're a man of the world, Fettes, you wouldn't hold me to promise given in drink.
Believe it or not.  It's best for you to pretend that you do.  After all, it was you who ordered this specimen, received it here, and paid for it.  That makes you a party to murder.
You couldn't do that, Doctor.
Why, yes.
They're uncommon bold, the grave robbers -- and the daft doctors who drive them on.
I'm by way of being a medical myself.
Well, then, Doctor MacFarlane -- although I've known a time, Toddy, when you liked the name.  Aye, and many are dead now who called you by it; rough and wild ones they were, too.  But come Toddy, sit down here with your young friend.
Afraid you are not as good a doctor perhaps as you make out to be.
Oh, yes, you will.  You'll do it to oblige Fettes and myself.
Maybe there's some private reason between you and me which will make you -- some long lost friend of ours.  Say that you'll do it for me and my friend, Mr. Fettes, here.
I've had some experience.
I set those blocks together, patched the muscles. I put the nerves where they should be -- I did it and I did it right -- and she won't walk --
I am a doctor. I teach medicine.
The heart pumps it.
In the brain, I tell you. I know.
Would you grudge me a glass with my old crony, Meg?
I've drunk enough tonight.
Would you bribe me to leave you be?
What did you hear?
No digging Joseph. The churchyards are too well guarded. We will "Burke" them,
I never heard that song. But what did they do?
How long after that was the paralysis complete?
See here, child, when you have this pain in your back, where is it?
A carriage overturned.  My husband was killed and Georgina was hurt.
How long ago?
I'm not heartless, Ma'am.  I have every sympathy for you and for the little girl, but if I were to consent to every operation brought to me, I'd have no time for teaching -- and that's a great responsibility upon me, Ma'am -- a great responsibility.
Then all my surgery is no good. There's something wrong with the child -- something I don't know -- something I can't define -- can't diagnose.  I can do nothing for her.
He must leave me alone.
I'm looking for my friends.
I'm thinking... that explains a lot.
The strip joint?
Big bang, primordial ooze, divine hand of a benevolent creator?  All possibilities. Although recent events have given me doubts about the benevolent creator.
A job. Construction. Twelve an hour.
AAAANK. That's not how we play the game.
How can you die if you're already dead?
I was talking about you.
... is that I sent them here. I told them she came here sometimes. With her dirtball boyfriend. That's exactly what I said.
I don't want to see!
I know.
Guy dressed for Halloween?
She was eighteen years old! There were four of them. They stabbed her fifty three times! Where's the fucking accident?! Huh?! Where is it?!
But you, you've had them.
My name is Klaatu.  I spent two days at your Walter Reed Hospital. Room 309. My doctor's name was Major White -- and I had a very attractive nurse called Ruth, who's getting married next Wednesday.  If you are not interested -- or if you intend to turn me over to your Army -- we needn't waste any more time.
If you mean that you are afraid of us--
I leave that in your hands.
Sure we did! He wasn't there but we went to see him. And Mr. Carpenter showed him how to do his arithmetic.
I mean -- on account of that policeman last night.  You think he's a bank robber, maybe? Or a gangster?
I couldn't go to sleep, Mom. I had to tell you!
Now, Bobby, just a minute--
Where is that?
You think it can go faster than an F- 36?
You're just kidding, aren't you?
Wouldn't you like to meet him?
Sit down, Mr. Harley.
I'm afraid, in the present situation you'll have to learn to think that way.
My mission here is not to solve your petty squabbles. It concerns the existence of every last creature who lives on Earth.
Our problems are very complex, Mr. Klaatu. You mustn't judge us too harshly.
Well, we could--
You think it's all right for you to stay here?
What about him?
Are you crazy? After what happened today?
He'll have you -- and Tom.
I was only trying to be helpful. He was having difficulty with a problem.
I suppose you know that Barnhardt does a lot of secret work for the Army.
In this case the secret wouldn't be worth much. He doesn't know the answer himself.
No, I'm a resident as of today and you'll probably be seeing a lot of me... I've been collecting comic books all my life... perhaps you'd like to see my collection?
Fine!  Stay here!
The Prince of Darkness.
You know what?  You're absolutely right.
Honda 250, huh?
Where the hell are you from, Kryton???
Vampires, my friend.  Vampires.
There's a cop behind us.
Your dog knows flesh-eaters when he smells 'em!
I don't want names!  Just lead me to him.  Where's their nest?
It's called the Indian walk. Walkin' without makin' a sound.
I guess so.  She said not to be late.
No, Laddie.  It was a <u>memory</u>.
Okay.
Soon as I finish this comic.  Okay?
-- I'm not talking about Max!  To hell with Max!
Mom!
What happened?  Is everybody all right?!
I'm not looking for a tape.  What I need is --
Do I look that needy?
Oh, right.  I always gets those two confused.
Did you want to talk to me?
I just wanted to... I, uh...
If you want your ear pierced, I'll do it.
Let's go see them.
I know, I've felt it...
I'm weak... Soon I'll need to feed.
No.  On the phone.
Don't turn on the light.
Look at your reflection in the mirror!!
Don't kill anybody until we get back to you...
Well, after I worked on him -- thought I'd let him rest.  Left the room for a bit.  When I came back, he was gone.
So what's our problem?
No, I... I don't mean infection... or disease...
Well, who the hell you think wants to get in there with you?
Look Blair, maybe you're right about this.  But we've got to be rational. We've got to talk this over.  I'm unarmed and I'm coming in.
Know what you mean, Blair.  Trust is a tough thing to come by these days. Just trust in the Lord.
Hell no.
Why you so damn anxious to let him in here...
Was dark... find a light...
Childs, you got the torch?  You get your ass in here!!
Screw the dogs!!  Torch it!!
Well, go on.
We got morphine, don't we.
We'll see.  Let's try Clark.
If you're worried about anything, let's take that blood test of yours.
I guess I'm the only one.
Thank you.
Bennings?
A couple of hours.
Extinguishers.
Little over two hours.
What is it out there, anyway? Forty-five knots?
I'm sure a lot of you already know.
Screw the flashlights.  Where the hell were you?
Why?
Forget about Childs.  He's over.
He's one of them.
And everyone looks like us?
What else can they do?
Where?
I'll be all right... You go back to the village and light the fire.  So we can find our way home.
This is it?
Around here.
You know of them?
You'll live like this forever. Alone.  You were meant to help.  To be with people.  Not like this.
And if the truth is so horrible that it will haunt your dreams for all time?
Last night.
Send him home.  You don't want him to see it.
It frightens you.
Aren't you a plucky little -- ?
Yes.  But you've done enough. Thank you for your help... I hope someday people read your books again.
End...?
Created?
No... they didn't survive only to be your food.  You did that.
I'm afraid your indignation is lost here.  I have no more "human" response to the Eloi then you would have to a carrot.  It's just how we live now.
When a creature shows too much independent thought we remove them from the gene pool.  We're breeding them for submission.  Soon they will be fully domesticated.
Yes.  Initiative and daring are not desirable traits in the Eloi.  But you should be happy for her.  She won't remember the creature she was.  She will... become.
Because...
I am the Fifth Avenue Public Library informational kiosk.  VOX registration NY-114.  May I help you?
Well there's something new.
I mean... well... affection.
You know I can't.
Trust me...
I need... to talk to you.
Not here... alone.  Please.
All right...
We took a walk three days ago.
Tonight's the night?
You know generally teachers are supposed to teach real equations that add up to real numbers.
You sound like my father...
How romantic...
Oh?
But you won't listen.  You won't see me, you won't see anyone.  What would you like me to tell Jamie? That Uncle Alex is busy?  That Uncle Alex is hiding up there in his laboratory --
What is it?
You wouldn't believe me.
There are trains leaving Grand Central every then minutes.  A dozen liners leaving the harbor. Get on one of them.  Go to Singapore, Scotland, Manchuria, anywhere, just away from here --
You're dying here.  Don't you see that?!
I'm glad.
Yes!
No!
Here?
I see.
As I recall the syllabus the name of your tutorial is "Applied Mathematics and Engineering", am I correct?
Exactly correct, sir.
But I know that none of my faculty would ever deviate from the assigned curriculum.
My equations are not parlor-tricks!
Well, I guess you'd call us... New Yorkers.
Of course.  You're just tired. Mara, will you look after Alexander tonight?
They've gone to a better place.
That's quite enough, Kalen.
Should we be...
I'm just looking at you. Does that make you uncomfortable?
I had a patient a few years ago. His name was Ted Casey...
I don't give a shit about your patient!
My business?
Means we believe in doing his work and fear what the world would be like if we didn't at least try to.
How...how are you here?
No. I didn't. I swear I didn't. I probably helped push you to kill yourself, but I didn't do it.
He didn't either.
I thought you said you never knew your father.
I wish they'd skip the formality of this annual review and just cut our budget. Our silence on the matter should be enough to appease the civic conscience without wasting an hour we don't have.
His body was found on January 1, 1993, but do you know if that was long after he had died?
What about Dr. Becker and Mr. Gries?
If you don't get out of my house right now, I'll call the police.
What? Now you're gonna show me some kind of driver's license?
No, I don't have anything to show you. I'm here from a mental hospital.
I'm sorry for upsetting you, [beat] but I'm not lying to you.
No, you didn't. They found William Starks' body dead in the snow.
How'd he die?
Why?
I know. It was perfect. [Beat] Erase my sanity and you erase anything I'll ever say.
It's not a prison, it's a hospital. There's got to be some way out of there and you've got to find it...
Here, drink this. I'll get the heat going.
They're not.
Then why isn't there anyone around?
You're not crazy.
No. I don't want it to.
You thought my father was crazy?
I was. But I saw a lot of cuts and a lot of blows. I'm sorry I don't know more about your father's. [Sincerely] I didn't know about everything that went on here.
My dad wrote some things down before he died.
I didn't see that much of it -- same as now. I only saw it as part of my own life.
Because of the future. I know what's going to happen.
You told me about him. I saw you and I think you thought I knew something about him. So you told me.
I don't know how you know about Eugene, but these ideas are part of your delusions.
What for?
Don't you go to jail for that?
Is it true?
[Beat] Thanks.
Let me ask you that again. This time, look around and consider your options.
So you never knew your mother?
You want anything special for dinner?
I don't know, honey.  I guess it would depend.
Umm, yes.  She was driving.
He said he took it to a motel in Oklahoma City.  He also says that at that time he met a man.  He identified you through a series of mug shots.  He also told us that you and Mrs. Dickinson seemed "close." Is that true?
You might say we had a meeting of the minds, yes.
You know what?  You're starting to irritate me.
There's two girls out there that had a chance, they had a chance...!  And you blew it for 'em.  Now they've gotten in some serious trouble, some very serious trouble and for at least part of it, I'm gonna hold you personally responsible for anything that happens to them.  I've got no feelin' for you.  But I may be the only person in the world who gives a rat's ass what happens to them and you're either gonna tell me every damn thing you know, so there's a small chance I can actually do them some good, or I'm gonna be all over you like a fly on shit for the rest of your natural life.  Your misery is gonna be my goddamn mission in life.  That's a sincere promise.
Alright.
Tell us about him.
Oh, definitely.
It's okay.  I'm married, too.
Well, you wanna use the shower?
She's off with Jimmy, that's her boyfriend.
You're a bank robber?
Well, first you pick your place, see, then I'd just sit back and watch it for awhile.  Ya gotta wait for just the right moment, which is something you know instinctively, that can't be taught.  Then I'd waltz on in...
Can't it go to any office?
Good.  That was good.  Where do I go?
Who is it?
You didn't see that one comin', did ya?
I'm choking on it.
You wanna come with me, please? Walk around and get in the car, please.
I don't know how to fish, Louise.
Neither do I, Thelma, but Darryl does it, how hard can it be?  I'll see you later.  Be ready.
So what if he was?  It's all your years of waitin' tables has made you jaded, that's all.
In the meantime, you said we were gonna have some fun.  So let's have some!
Ready when you are.
Jesus Christ!  Louise, you shot him.
Tell them what?!  What, Thelma? What do you think we should tell them?
Our next move?  I'll say one thing, Louise.  This is some vacation.  I sure am having a good time.  This is real fun.
Just what is that supposed to mean?
It means shut up, Thelma.
Why are you actin' like this?
Actin' like what?!  How am I supposed to act?  'Scuse me for not knowing what to do after you blow somebody's head off!
Give me the keys.
Do you think Darryl's having an affair?
I don't want to go that way.  Find a way that we don't have to go through Texas.
You're a vision, Louise, a goddamn vision of loveliness, you always are.
Yes, now that you mention it.  You seem crazy.  Like you're on drugs.
Well, I'm not on drugs.  But I might be crazy.
Thelma, please get a hold of yourself.  You're making a spectacle.
Okay.  Shit, Thelma!  What'd you do? I mean, what did you say?
Yes!  I believe I am!
What for?
Harlan.
Yes.
Okay, okay... I've got some tequila. You want some tequila?
You're drivin'.
How long do you think that'll take?
Go?
We're fine!  How are you?
All right, I did, but I was in a weird place then.
Oh, Mary, honey, you're taking this all wrong.  I'm not leaving...
Each day is better than the next.  Have you ever been, you know... in love with someone?
I mean since then.
I don't know.
I also called Unsolved Mysteries.
What? On your day off? Do you even know the guy?
Copped a tin of Altoids at the car wash.
It wasn't my truck -- I was helping out a guy in a wheelchair.
Who?
Big guy -- goes to Barrington high school.
What can I tell you? It's a healthier lifestyle down here, and it's easier to succeed when your head's clear. Those guys I worked with back in Boston, they were a bad influence.
Tell Bill to get the fuck off!
Yep.
You said it, mister.  I gotta go.
Wow. That's a place I've always wanted to go. Is it true the mountains are so tall you can't see the tops?
You know...  ...the guys who ride the short bus.
What say we get outta here and go crush a bucket?
Magda? She's not my grandmother -- actually she rents the apartment right next to mine. Her husband passed away a couple years ago so she doesn't like to be alone.
No, forget it, it was stupid.
No.
Anyway, the good news is I have all the information you need. Got it from her bookie -- nice guy. You should definitely call her, Ted. I mean she's a real sparkplug, that one. She seems determined to get those rugrats off welfare and with your help I'll bet she does it.
Oh. I thought  That's not it anyway. I know this doesn't make any sense to you, but I just can't turn it off that fast. I still feel something for her.
Fetched a pretty penny, too. Don't forget, it's the Sumo culture, they pay by the pound there. Sort of like tuna.
What do you mean 'why'?
Absolutely! I was there twice last year. Which building is yours?
Do you know the... soccer stadium?
Oh look, it's Doob! Will you excuse me a minute, Tucker?
Maybe this'll jog your memory.
Who?
Hey, this is a pretty nice place.
A salesman -- that's what I am. I mean, I'm gonna be anyway. I'm starting my own company -- video sales -- just as soon as I get enough seed money.
Fuck kindred spirits. My little Puffy here's gonna tell you all you need to know about this guy in about two seconds flat. If he starts yapping, he's a loser; if Puffy's relaxed... well, you got yourself a keeper.
Oh, yeah, of course, dear.
Love? Come on, I wouldn't call it love.
I can't do it -- I just found out it's his birthday.  I guess I've gotta cancel on Ted.
Well that's what I'm trying to figure out. How long have you known him?
Look, it's just that something about him struck me as odd last night. He gave me this funny vibe. Anyway, I called some friends back east. They don't know of any architect named Patrick Healy and he's not listed as a Harvard alumnus.
Yeah, yeah. Okay, I think I know what to do. I'll call him right now.
Just a minute.
That's weird. I talked to your brother Jimmy five or six times.
Trying to be.
Wow. That's too bad. He sounds almost perfect.
That you put a murderer on my trail?
What did you think, Ted? That you could spy on me and trick me into thinking you were someone I could... really go for?
Mary, come on...
You forgot your keys!
Really.
It?  Oh it. All right, these things happen, let me have a look. It's not the end of the world.
How the hell'd you get the beans all the way up top like that?
Just relax, dear. Now, um... what exactly are we looking at here?
Yeah, so... I'm gonna wait and see what happens there... But that sounds great, yeah.
Carrying out our mission, Mr. Secretary. If you don't mind, we're very busy right now. We need to be able to do our jobs.
And it can be relayed beyond Comrade Khruschev's ears to the top circles of my government
Of course. Our pledge can be relayed to any government official Secretary Khruschev sees fit to satisfy.
Where the hell are you?
We're split down the middle. If I held a vote I think airstrike would beat blockade by a vote or two.
Somebody had to say it. I respect Adlai for having the guts to risk looking like an appeaser.
That's all well and good, but what do we say to 'em?
Yeah, but the country didn't even exist as a country yet. It was a mess, and he didn't have a leg to stand on.
Give it a rest. You were thinking the same thing, just didn't have the guts to take the heat.
The Jupiters are obsolete. They were supposed to have been dismantled last summer anyway --
No, Ken. I need to see him now...
48 hours. In 48 hours there can be no deals.
An invasion...
No. I'm glad I'm home.
I'm doing a piece on Skybolt. I hear Macmillan's meeting with him in Nassau.
He was.
No you weren't.
I don't care. Cancel it.
No way.
All right. 'Cause you get armed boarders climbing into Soviet ships, shots being fired across bows...
Breathe, Carl. Four, nice, deep ones.
Rug samples.
Are you hungry? I have some nice raw kidney in the truck.
Different culture. Hard to penetrate. The Indians don't like white cops poking around. And that's why we're in a position where we have to bring in an American Indian agent.
Leo's been out here too long, man. I'm taking him to ceremonial burial.
-- violation of the Major Crimes Act on an Indian Reservation is within the jurisdiction of the Federal Bureau of Instigation. I know that.
Beats the hell outta me.
Yeah. I... I fell asleep. I can't believe it. I --
-- never mind Eagle Bear. We've got Jimmy nailed. Let's go!
-- what the hell is Red Deer Table?
What is it? It's genocide, that's what it is. It's a Pay Zone for some U.S. corporation and a Dead Zone for the people here. Uranium, Cooch.
-- Well, maybe two-seventeen.
No, this is the home of the Oglala Sioux and I want the dog-fucker who killed Leo. Whether you get him or I get him, I just want him. Shit's been goin' on too long.
Maybe you're not aware of this, Crow Horse, but I just flew in from a place called the Twentieth Century where we have such things as electrostatic tracking methods, psycholingusitics, DNA fingerprinting; I don't have to crawl around with the scorpions and talk to the fucking trees to get answers. Leo was killed right here.
Go back to the M.E., take a look inside Leo's exit wounds and tell me how chicken feed got in there. Trust me, there ain't chickens in the Badlands. His mother's place is --
Heavy, heavy duty. Taku Wakan. Wanagi Spirits. It's one of those few places we'd never go to as kids. Still don't. Some of the old people say Crazy Horse is buried back there. We have to go Ray. Together. Like his vision.
-- no. No offense to the old man. I appreciate you trying to help. But I put my ass on the line coming out here, man.
What's real to you? Wall Street? Capital Hill? Now they are myths.
Not no more.
Sorry.
I'm a full-blood Oglala.
Yeah. Fitful dreams.
He's looking at a few hundred years in Leavenworth. He's not gonna come out without a fight.
You're the FBI. That's your job, isn't it? Ya know how many of our Warrior brothers got killed out here? I never saw any investigating then. Why now? What's going down here?
You forced an innocent man to run like an animal. You've tried to poison my people's hearts against me with your manipulation, with letters I never wrote... you've been watching me eat, work, raise my family... wash myself in the river. And now you're here, arresting me at a sacred place.  In your eyes, that's power.
Great.
Black Tail District, X22. You ready for this? Leo wasn't killed in the Badlands. I... I found the location.
Mister Tully.
No. Can't say that I have, Richard. Richard do you know why I'm here?
Get up!
Leo knew something heavy and was trying to tell Jimmy. But you must not know how serious it was or you would have delivered. Do you realize what Leo could have told Jimmy?! Do you?!
That's a big comfort to me.
And on to a bigger one with you?
Yeow!
Yes, ma'am, At first. Then I was directly above him.
Is that all? CHARLIE What else do you want?
I don't mix with the boys. I work here. Let's keep it professional.
Lieutenant...
You turn into him, check him out, identify friend or foe.
You have to shoot him down....If he's smart, he'll turn away before that happens.
What about the plane?
I don't enjoy watching things suffer.
You don't have to kill it.
I watched my mother die. Cancer. She had a long time to think about it. They say you reach an agreement with death. Come to accept the fact that pretty soon you won't be here. I didn't see that. She... was very brave...braver than I am. You go up there, there isn't time to think. If you make a mistake, you're just a smudge on the ground. Simplifies funeral arrangements.
You ever fly an F-14? 
I'm fine.
What do you want?
What?
Only when you're depressed. Then it passes.
Not as silly as some. You know the silliest one? ...that we are gods. That we control events on the beach... that we can turn back time...
What truth?
I hope you find him.
Well what?
ROGER, COUGAR.  Okay boys, pull out with your hands up and nobody'll get hurt.
NO JOKE, COUGAR. ON THE LEVEL. EVEN I WOULDN'T DO THAT TO YOU.
This is crazy!
You're crazy. We're level.
Can't you feel it? I'm hanging in my straps!
Saving them some paperwork.
Not anymore.
Passing 8. Passing 6. Lock your harness!
Okay.
What do I want?
We're here because we're the best flyers in the wing. Not because of some MiG encounter.
Why Goose, whose butt did you kiss to get here?
This is Maverick.
This is Evan Mitchell, he steers the thing.
Is there anybody in the Navy you don't know?
Gotta keep track of the competition.
What, been drunk? Sure! Plenty!
Right.
Come on, I got over six bucks on the line.
I've had enough...for now.
Let's go. Eject.
Thirty seconds. That's all it took to blow us out of the sky.
Until last night. Did you see the moves I was making on that girl at the party?
I didn't ruin her.
Nope.
I think I can work it out on my own.
Just below ten thousand.
What the hell you doing?
ENGAGING THE OTHER GUY. WOOD, YOU'RE ON YOUR OWN.
I'm nothing like him.
They waved him off. He thought he knew better. He hit the ramp.
Yeah...Well, actually no...Sort of.
I'm trying to neutralize a traitor.
No, sir.
Yes, sir.
You better get down here.
It's not my fault.  We hit a memory cap.
Ernie, dump him in a cab.  Around the corner.  Tiffany, you help him.  I'll destroy his file and refund his money.  And if anybody comes asking...we've never heard of Douglas Quaid.
Not really.  I've just always been fascinated by Mars.
Hetero.
Oh, I get it; I'm dreaming!  And this is all part of that delightful vacation your company sold me.
Mr. Quaid, can you hear yourself? "She's real because you dreamed her?"
O.K., everybody pull out!
C'mon!
You went to Rekall, remember?
I did?
What the fuck did I do wrong?!  Tell me!
What is it?
Do what?
Lori, move.
Oh God, Doug.
Doug, nobody tried to kill you.
Bullshit.
Beats me.  I just work here.
I didn't know you were so kinky.
Doug...You wouldn't shoot me, would you?  After all we've been through?
Nooo!  I would never do anything to hurt you.  I want you to come back to me.
I'm telling you, Doug, your brain won't know the difference.  Guaranteed, or your money back.
You're talking ancient history, Doug. Nowadays, traveling with Rekall is safer than getting on a rocket.  Look at the statistics.
I'm not interested in that.
Aaah, let me tantalize you.  You're a top operative, back under deep cover on your most important mission.  People are trying to kill you left and right. You meet a beautiful, exotic woman...
Melina, please...People are trying to kill me.
I don't need Kuato for that.
I'm not sure dear?  What do you think?
Aliens built it.
Damn, you know, those kids turn up oil or uranium or something out there...next thing the Feds will be at our door.  "Sorry, time to move. Eminent domain."
Hang on, Burt.  The bastards are up to something.
Roger that.
I don't know...  They're pretty quick...fifteen seconds?
Damn!  Val, we can't get them.  Never figured on having to shoot through dirt!  Best goddamn bullet stop there is.  Come back.
Listen!  Listen!  We know what they are!  They're big things under the ground!  Much bigger than we thought!  They're coming after you! They're coming right now!
In a minute.
Howdy, Rhonda.
You bet.  You gonna be staying up here?
Whatever the hell we are, we should quit and go get ourselves some real employment.
Well, I'm a victim of circumstance.
Adios, bridge!
Then where's the goddamn Conway Twitty coming from?
<u>Why</u> would they do it?
So this is the guy that had your seismos working overtime?
Sure, Earl, everybody knows about them.  We just didn't tell <u>you</u>. Come on, nobody's ever seen one of these!  We're really <u>in</u> on something here!
Maybe it is.  Why don't you take a little stroll and see?
Not going to pole vault anywhere. That's for sure.
Not yet, not yet...
No ties.
She just practically asked you for a date.  What the hell is wrong?!
Oh yeah?  Think about this:  She ain't as narrow-minded as you. I'll lay odds she's looking for character in a man.  For my part, I'd be proud to have her.  I'd goddamn worship her.
The con...!  Oh my God.
Ah, but consider this, if we don't finish the roof, we can looks at that sky all the time.
Okay, ten dollars.
Yeah.  But I'll tell you, if you ever wanted proof God is a man, this is it.
Yeah, good!  Something to keep them busy.  We need a decoy.
Do you see a toilet here you think is really me?
Let's snuff this lowlife!
Of course.
Look -- I'm tired, I'll see you in the morning, Eddie.
I feel much better now.
I am. Eddie -- we've got nothing.
I don't have time to read every word in every report, I'm too busy getting killed in court... Meantime my crackerjack investigator can't find the goddam art supplies store where Chuckie-fucking-Roeder works!
I haven't paid you.
Figures.
Racist asshole came at me.
I killed the motherfucker.
...Okay...
But why?
"No," what?
By trusting me. Shit, man...
For awhile we had this dream we were innocent. That was our bond... but then we woke up. And now I'd like to hear everything.
No, s-sir.
What am I looking for? You're the one talking deal.
No, Mr. Dowd, you'll see me in court. I'm prosecuting this case.
If I were sitting where I normally sit, I would say "Calls for speculation."
And who were the detectives who assisted you, Mr. Reynard?
So what'd this guy do? Snitch off a dealer?
-- Why don't you ask Chuckie?
Yeah, we do some of that.
I'm a soldado in the G-Wing Regiment.
"Materiel"? What do you mean by that?
Soldado.
Isn't it unusual for an Asian to be accepted into a Cuban prison gang?
Shu's the only one I know of...
No! They g-got the wrong guy! I saw it! The killer wasn't Chinese.
Blonde.
Tell me some other things about her.
Who are you? Who are you REALLY?
Get lost Bobby.
Oh, yeah? You'll be callin' soon and maybe I'm not gonna be there.
Your behavior is not funny and is wasting the time of the Federal Government.
Well, where are you going?
You can tell J. Edgar that I was at a party and I got fifteen fuckin' witnesses.
I'VE GOT A SURPRISE FOR YOU, CHET. SOMETHING INTERESTING THAT I WOULD LIKE TO SHOW YOU. ARRANGEMENTS ARE BEING MADE AND I WILL MEET YOU AT THE PORTLAND, AIRPORT.
YOUR SURPRISE, CHET. HER NAME IS LIL.
ALBERT, COME BACK HERE. HE'S GONE CALL THE FRONT DESK.
No one could've found those splinters without a machine like this and no one has a machine like this.
Tell me about the letter.
Where am I? And how can I leave?
Sorry to hear it.
Any friends?
Her left arm. It was numb. She said she couldn't use it. Said it had no feeling. Probably from the drugs she was taking.  I just thought I ought to tell you.
Code, I've heard a lot about this.
Agent Desmond, would you hold the finger for me. There's something up there.
He's not the murderer.  But he's a bozo.
Thanks.
You're telling me, but only because you never let me in on any of it... you're not going to see Bobby, are you?
Sweet? God, he's gorgeous.
Faster and faster. For a long time you wouldn't feel anything. Then you would burst into fire... forever.
Okay, I suppose I should go home.
Of course...
Laura, I am your friend.
Laura, you have to deal with all of this.
That's right. There's no place left to go is there, James?
What do you mean?
Everything, but everything.
What?
Oh, honey, you don't have to lie to me. Ever. You can tell me anything. I'll understand.
If it's okay with you I'm going to Bobby's to do my homework.
Hyggelig a mote dem. Jeg Heter Leland Palmer.
A friend from school.
Did you come home during the day last week?
NO, YOU HAVE TO KILL ME.
I always thought you knew it was me.
Bobby didn't give you this?
Lay off the bennies, Leo.
Anybody can clean the surface of an object, but dirt can find its way anywhere. To really clean, you have to scrub below the surface.  WHERE THE DIRT IS, SHELLY.
If Leo comes here, he won't believe that I am out doing the "Meals on Wheels".
Abrams...
What did he find?
All right. But let's keep the price down. I've called Ed Concannon. He recommends that we continue to respond as if we're going to trial.
I know that answer. If we went to trial would we win?
Yes.
That was our insurance company's recommendation.
And no one will know the truth.
In fact, you've just taken an oath that you would not commit perjury. You've just sworn to that. Isn't that right?
You've just said you signed it.
You didn't write that figure. And how is it that you remember that so clearly after four years?
I am seventy-four years old.
Nothing further, your Honor.
I'm going to uphold that.
She THREW UP IN HER MASK. Let's cut the bullshit. Say it: She THREW UP IN HER MASK.
I doubt we'll have to go to trial...
It's completely done on a contingency basis. That means whatever the settlement is I retain one-third... that is, of course, the usual arrangement...
It was good of you to meet...
...I made a reservation at...
No. No thank you, Doctor. You go home.
Then what good would it do to ruin the reputation of two men, to help a girl whose life's not going to be changed in the least? You know what CODE BLUE means?
She threw up in her mask, yes. But she hadn't eaten one hour prior to admission.
Thank you.
That's perfectly all right. I'm kind of rushed. Do you mind if we walk while we talk?
Mrs. Simmonds.
Yes.
And did you write the numeral 'one' down on the record, standing for one hour?
I was held up.
My client can't walk, your Honor.
Defense...?
What?
No, no, you listen to me. All I wanted in this case is an even shake. You rushed me into court in five days... my star witness disappears, I can't get a continuance, and I don't give a damn. I'm going up there and I'm going to try it. Let the Jury decide. They told me Sweeney he's a hard- ass, he's a defendant's judge. I don't care. I said, the hell with it. The hell with it. I'll take my chances he'll be fair.
My name's Frank. And furthermore, you came back to see me tonight.
Maybe I can do something right.
We, we... No... we just had a small reversal in the case...  I have some, uh... I have some work to do...
You can't work if you can't think. You get in bed. It's all right. I'll stay here with you. It's all right. Come on...
You're like a kid, you're coming in here like it's Saturday night, you want me to say that you've got a fever -- you don't have to go to school...
Mr. Alito, please.
We get it at work. We get the magazine at work.
I've got nothing to say to you.
You know what happened.
Then why aren't you testifying for their side?
...now who is that...?
That's the point, you stupid fuck. Let them buy it. We let them buy the case. That's what I took it for. You let this drop -- we'll go up to New Hampshire, kill some fuckin' deer...
...he's a good man...? He's the Prince of Fuckin' Darkness... he'll have people in there testifying that the broad is well -- they saw her Tuesday on a surfboard at Hyannis... don't fuck with this case.
They still have to take it to a jury.
D'you meet with Dr. Gruber...?
She's workin' the late shift at the Hospital. She's at home now, I'm going over there to talk to...
What difference can that make...? All right...
Hello. This is Mr. Dorchester in Records. We're looking for Kathy Costello...
Huh.
The same thing that happened on our Pacific Coast.  Anything from them yet?
Forrester's the man behind the new atomic engines.  They had him on the cover of 'Time'.  You've got to rate to get that!
You never know where you're going to wind up when you go to a square dance!
But they seem to murder everything that moves...!
What was it like?
I'd like to borrow your car and take a look at it in the morning.
I warned you Civil Defense people to be ready if you have to evacuate.
Not all.  Radio is out.  But our field phones are okay so far.
We did.  Bad mistake.  The fans are clamoring for more. So, Evil never dies, right?  Anyway, a while back we got a call from Wes.  He's got this idea.  And who better to resurrect Freddy than his creator?
The nightmares.
I know.  We asked him to keep it kind of surprise until we talked.  Look, how about we get in touch your agent.  You still with Jerry?
No biggie, really.
You've got to get back on the horse some time.  Look, you've had a nutcase making harassing phone calls.  I know how scary that feels.
It was an earthquake and it was dark.  I have no idea.
Get her back!  I've got to go in!  Get me a full anesthetic, STAT!
Very well. As soon as we gather the appropriate papers...
The mean old man with the claws.
He can follow the breadcrumbs, right?
Under my covers.  Kids singing, and way down there, the man...the mean man...
No, I don't think so.  You just have to...pray, or reach...
It's actually been giving me Freddy nightmares.
When do you think it'll be done?
The way he's writing is so weird, who knows?  I asked him how far he'd gotten at the funeral, and what was it he said...?  Oh yeah, as far as Dylan trying to reach God.  Weird, huh, that he'd have your kid in it?
Kids know when something's bugging a parent.  You've got no idea who this is calling?
John.  It's Heather.  I need help!
You're right.  That sounds crazy!
Yes.
Listen, dammit.
It can be captured, sometimes.
Robert?  I...
Uh...sure...when?
Coffee'd be nice.
Weight!  Hey!  Blow the man down...
Mr. Lawford, stand by to ease the mainsheet.  Rick, get on the jib sheet.  George, John, Philip, Tim and Dick go aloft to unstop the forecourse.  George will show you what to do.  Tod, show your men the forward pinrail and stand ready on the buntlines and clewlines. Forecourse first... work upward.
Skipper, uh, the crew is pretty much doing group boot over the side.
Yeah, sure.
Gieg, Chuck.
Believe what?
I just can't believe it.
Like this!
That is the point... And Skipper'll slip off the hook.
It says she was originally Schooner rigged, but Captain Sheldrake turned her into a brigantine.  I think square rigs look so much more romantic.
I know you will.
I can't watch this.
Fine.
Do what?
I couldn't.
You can't run from the wind son. You trim your sails, face the music and let the chips fall.  Bill, let's close her up, dog, tight.
Sir...?
So is violating international law.
No.
No.  Look, it's me okay?  Can't it just be about me?  For once?
What's that?
Not a chance.  Remind them that according to the Geneva Convention, firing on a civilian vessel on the high sea is an act of war.
How the hell are we gonna get outta here?
Why'd you jump?
Well, as soon as you grow some balls, let me know.
There are some things that everybody does in the same language.
I'm not staying out here.
You climb damn it, or so help me I'll haul you to the foretop by your diaper and leave you there!
Except, a "White Squall".  With all due respect Captain Sheldrake, they're only boys...
I understand.
I used to helm a school ship.  A long time ago.
... Absolutely not.
No.  I didn't.
Yeah, well, if he says that all that flab turns into dick at midnight, he's a liar.
So you're gonna be needin' the "blue- bird" pretty soon?
Man, I gotta take a piss bad... Can I use your head there?
Hell, no, belongs to my girl's sister. The sister's been over to New Orleans, lets us have it while she's gone. Where's that pretty little lady of yours today?
You an indian?
Ready for another?
Talked to her this afternoon... While you was out.
She's my girl... She's drivin'... That bother you?
Told ya I would. You still riled?
You still screwing sixteen-year-olds in the ass?
No, of course.
What's gonna happen when he sees me drivin' the car tomorrow?
Club Zanzibar.
No sir...
We are in the same businesses and also we are fishermen.
Guilty on a reduced charge. Hundred dollar fine and ordered to desist. Pigeons carry diseases and muss up the place. You seen it. Plain filth.
...Asshole.
This island of yours sounds like a kind of unpredictable place.
The real joke is we never went fishing, but we're still fishing.
Don't talk down to me, Johnnie Farragut. I know what volition means, and that's why I want Sailor Ripley off the planet! He's pure slime and it's leakin' all over my baby. Maybe you could push him into makin' some kinda move and then kill him dead. You'd only be defendin' yourself, and with his record, nobody'd fuss.
Now, Marietta, I am goin' to help you. And don't be gettin' carried away. You don't want to be bringin' Santos and his people into it.
I'm stayin' right here by the phone until you find Lula, then I'm comin' to get her. You call soon's you got somethin', even if it's three in the a.m.
Somethin' was upsettin' you bad last night, and you wanted to tell me and I figured you wanted to tell me so's I could help...
All I have to do is grab my suitcase, and I'm ready. You're lucky cause I happen to love night drivin'.
You ain't actin', mama.
Why, Pace Roscoe Ripley, ain't you got one cute mouth tonight?
Pace, your daddy'd love you even if you didn't have no hair at all.
What brand'd she smoke?
Camels, same as me... Guess both my mama and my daddy died of smoke or alcohol related illness.
Sailor, that ozone layer is disappearin'. Seems to me the government could do somethin' about it. One of these mornings the sun'll come up and burn a hole clean through the planet like an X-Ray.
I just think about things as they come up. I never been much of a planner.
Too bad we all can't, baby... One thing about Dell?
Yeah, I had my first taste on that trip to Juarez. At that age you still got a lot of energy.
Told her my name. Then she said somethin' like, 'It's so noisy down here. Why don't we go upstairs so we can hear ourselves?' She turned around and led the way. I knew I had an important lesson to learn that day.
Okay, manslaughterer who's broke his parole and got in mind nothin' but immoral purposes far's you're concerned.
What's that, honey?
I got one on me at Lake Lanier. Lifeguard poured salt on it and it dropped off. Felt awful. He was a cute boy, though, so it was almost worth it.
Ever imagine what it'd be like to get eaten alive by a wild beast? Sometimes I think it would be the biggest thrill?
Shhhhh... It's four o'clock... That woman's laugh the other day had somethin' to do with this feelin'?... Like bein' ripped apart by a gorilla, maybe... Grabbed sudden and pulled apart real quick by a real powerful one.
What was this one?
Well, I ain't upset about it, darlin'. Just give me an odd feelin' there a minute, is all.
Who knows, baby?
That's some big secret you been carryin', Sailor.
Yeah, I'm here.
You upset with me?
You think she's gonna make it?
Let's get outta here, honey.
I know you ain't particularly pleased bein' here.
Well, nothin' personal, but I ain't sure it's okay by me.
Love you, too.
That was in Vietnam.
The Indian official who supplied this information did so only on condition of anonymity. The Uttar Pradesh state authorities last October released five hundred turtles...
I ain't that dumb, mama. Sailor and I been on a crime spree? Knockin' off convenience stores all across the south? Ain't you read about it?
Well, you be careful with that boy, Lula.
Mama... if you get in the way of me and Sailor's happiness, I'll fuckin' pull your arms out by the roots.
Perhaps we should call a local law enforcement officer.
I'm sure I wouldn't know, ma'am... and buffalo hunting too... hmmmmm?
Have it your way... But you want it.
Well, like kill him with the atomic bomb?
Where?
You're not tellin' me that you're sweet on him?
I didn't see nothin'...
I ain't heard of nothin'.
Actually... I just want to go home.
How are you, Crabtree?
Oh. We're picking her up. Downtown.
I'm sure. Where is everyone?
Come on. Crabs. Don't do this. He's one of my students, for Christ sake. I'm not even sure if he's --
Shut up and drink.
Huh uh. A jockey. His name's, um, Curtis... Curtis Hardapple.
And now he's addicted to painkillers.
He can't piss standing up anymore.
Just go around him.
Is it a little late to call the Chancellor?
I told you. They keep him chained in the basement. Come on.
Oh! Huh. Exactly how do we do that?
Such as.
...we find the jacket.
There's only one problem, Tripp. We don't know his real name. We just made it up. In fact, we made the whole guy up.
I have an alternate version of the first chapter.
He was never able to reproduce them.
This 1966 maroon Ford Galaxie 500. You driving this car?
Bullshit. It's mine, motherfucker.
And your wife left you.
Move away, cupcake. He's got a gun.
A Manhattan book editor murdering a Mormon girl's clutch.
'Fraid so.
As long as it looks like her, I don't care. You know what I'm saying?
Stop calling me Vernon.
I'm in Kinship. Listen, Sara, there's some things we need to talk about...
You're in Kinship?
Trust me, I understand. I just want to say something to you, Grady.
She likes old movies like I do, that's all.  Besides, she doesn't really know me. She thinks she does, but she doesn't. Maybe it's because she's Mormon and I'm Catholic.
That's really it.
I guess. Walter never tells Sara the truth about how much he pays for these things.
Couldn't you've just pulled him off me?
What are we going to do with...
Most of the time he is, James. Some of the time he isn't. Now what do we have here?
I thought maybe you'd won a radio contest or something. Is that single- spaced?
Nothing, it's just that, well, it's been awhile since Arsonist's Daughter, and some people -- some of the kids in workshop -- thought maybe you were...
Washed up?
Ah. I don't believe in writer's block.
No one seems to know where you live, James. Hannah thought you'd like my couch.
So where have you been staying?
It's a hellhole. Three motels and a mannequin factory. My dad worked there for thirty-five years.
I'm telling you what I was told by my uncle. And he should know. He ran half a dozen men's clubs in Baltimore before he skipped town on a bad debt.
Didn't you say your Mom went to Catholic school?
That's right. That one.
It wasn't her dog. It's her husband's --  Who said anything about girlfriend?
And don't be so goddamn sensitive. Who cares what anybody thinks anyway? You want to be a good writer? You want to be a great writer? Then stop giving a damn what other people think. Most of them haven't thought in years.
That's why you're having them. Your spells.
James, like it or not, they're your parents.
Ah, wear whatever you want.
And I love the inscription you wrote to me. Only I'm not quite the downy innocent you think I am.
James is odd. I know he has an aunt in Sewickley Heights. I dropped him there once, but...  Come to think of it, it wasn't even his Aunt's house. He said she worked there. Or something. I don't remember.
Oh. Well. I...
At first the police thought he just ran away, but this afternoon Dr. Gaskell found some blood spots on the carpet --
No, it's not that, it's...
You got me.
I love you, Grady.
You heard? How?
Really? That was fast.
Are you limping? Why are you limping?
James Leer.
Would Walter really press charges?
I said it didn't sound like you.
Terry told me about Wonder Boys. Is it true? Did you lose it all?
I know.
I know it's you, Grady, I just... Christ, Grady, do you know what time it is?
It's three-thirty, Grady.
Taking the long way home.
Nothing's wrong. They went to Wellesley together.
I could be wrong. What happened anyway?
That's weird.
I like the noise.
No way, man, you'd rob me blind!
How old is Anna?
It wasn't like that.
I don't want to see any goddamn pictures.
C'mon, Walter.
Their sound is quite musical.
How does it sound?
I have to go.
Little Red Riding Hood.
Know what?
What's with the boxes?
Well, I guess I'll be seeing you.
It gives me headaches.
The new man. I'd keep away from him, if I were you.
Why's that?
Yeah, Mary-Kay, I think I do. Thanks a bunch for the advice.
I will be in three months.  I can't wait. I hate being eleven. It has to be the stupidest age in the world.
How come?
Would you like to sit on my lap?
Does he?
Ms. Kramer.
Yes you can, Robin.
What will happen if I do?
Yes?
You seem a little hostile today.
What?
Of course.
I'm still thinking about it.
I wish you'd give it a try.
Good. That's an honest answer. And why don't you like coming here?
Rosen? I don't have a problem with that.
I don't feel anything.
If I'm not, then what the hell am I doing here?
I mean, when will I be normal.
What did you think would happen?
I want you to calm down.
I said I was sorry.
I don't see --
Where?
Where are you?
A nap?
Me?
People without cars.
Guess I'm not like most women.
I'm just quiet.
You should buy several. I've got shitty light in my place, but my plants don't seem to mind. Light's important, but it's not everything.
Sorry.
They could eat you.
Of course. Sorry. I'm such a fucking asshole.
No you're not.
Do you?
Hi.
Because I like you.
No. Never again.
Yes! I want to know.
Why young girls, Walter?
Their power. They seduce me.
What?
Not ever?
Maybe you should be.
What's it look like?
Do what?
There we were, side by side, on the same ship, for two months.  I'm tool-pusher and we're testing this automated derrick of hers.  So, we get back on the beach and... we're living together.
How deep's the drop-off here?
No!  I'm okay now.  I just don't... I can't go any further in.
I'm switching off now.
No.  Look, forget it.  I don't want to talk about it.
But what did he see that made him panic?
Who's hysterical?  Nobody's hysterical!
Bud, this is me, Lindsey.  Okay?  You know me better than anybody in the world.  Now watch my lips... I saw these things.  I touched one of them.  And it wasn't some clunky steel can like we would build... it glided.  It was the most beautiful thing I've ever seen.
Somewhere behind this panel.  Hold this.
FUCK LOGIC!!
Tell me later.
Okay... Hippy's not going... McWhirter, you can run Little Geek.
Hey, you come on my rig, you don't talk to me, you start ordering my guys around.  It won't work.  You gotta know how to handle these people... we have a certain way of doing things here.
I'm not interested in your way of doing things. Just get your team ready to dive.
Let's go, guys.
Yeah, well you never should have married her then.
Yeah!  I mean, I don't know... it looks right.
I can't... make it... podner.
Just hold your water, okay?  So Kirkhill, we gonna do this or we gonna talk about it?
That guy's crazier'n a shithouse rat!
Deep.  It's classified... you know.  Anyway, you breathe liquid, so you can't be compressed. Pressure doesn't get to you.
Perry, stand by on the ROV.  Sorry about this, little buddy.  Better you than me, know what I mean?
Very good.  About one person in twenty just can't handle it.  They go buggo.  They're no way to predict who's susceptible, so stay alert.
A little more so this time.
No. It's not enough... I told you before that I would like to get away for a while and be alone.
And what about yesterday... at my house... didn't you have any feeling for me, even then?
You already know what they are.
Look... I'd like to get back to Lisca Bianca.
But how could we...at a time like this when we just... well, let's at least first have a look around the other islands. Could be that something might turn up there.
Well, what?
All I said was that it sounds like a good idea.
Then why don't we go up and see the ruins?
But of course... arrogant, haughty... Hasn't Anna ever told you?
And why do you tell us this only now?
I... I don't know... I didn't think it was worthwhile... She was laughing over it...
I don't know why. I just couldn't help it.
Who knows why they all left...
You look at me as though I had said something foolish...
No reason why...
Have you ever been in love?
Not really... It's suffocating in here... Shall we go out?
It couldn't be any clearer.
There too...
But how could they pose like that? I couldn't.
Look, Marshal, with those deep crevasses, you'll need some rope and ladders...
Don't worry, we've got everything.
Another thing; there's an old man who lives here on the island...
I know, I know. One thing at a time.
No. The owners are in Australia.
I don't see why I should mind.
Ettore must be fed up with me by now.
Oh, no, not at all. And then you know very well that he'll forgive you anything; just as long as you admit to him that you're a worse driver than he is...
Yes, even I had a mother. She was part Austrian, but she was still my mother. My childhood was like a tennis match; they bounced me back and forth, here and there...
I know, dammit, I know!  And just think -- if there ever was a woman so right, so perfectly cut out for all kinds of dissipations, degradations, infidelities... of.. . of... of debaucheries, it's her. Well, anyway, she's faithful. Faithful out of laziness... of unwillingness.
Take it easy, Raimondo. Why are you getting so impatient?
Oh... I'm sorry I have to rush but I've got to write a story about this thing that just happened... Tell me exactly how it all turned out.
You really must do me this one favor.
Who?
Because...
I'm not hungry.
Yes Mother.
Uh huh.
Oh, yes.
How were you sick?
And what did you do?
I fell asleep.
Is that where they say it came from... ?
Yes I do,  but I want you to...
No... no, I'm tired of talking, I've been talking for weeks, nobody believes me when I tell them anything... nobody listens to me.
Agnes...
Anything?
Are you married?
Do you have any children?
From their mothers and fathers of course. Before that, I... I don't know.
She was kind to me. She told me I was beautiful.
I don't understand them either. Do you suppose I was dropped on my head?
Did you ever want to be a mother yourself?
If you did want one, how'd you go about getting one?
Everything... I don't have children.
And you're unhappy.
Agnes...
Sometimes, yes.
I can't.
Oh, yes.
Yes.
Agnes, you're stupid.
Who am I?
Because I'm in trouble.
Did you want it to come out?
To be a mother?
Hm hmm. What did you have for dinner?
You don't like brussel sprouts?
We went to chapel for vespers.
No... don't hit me please...
That's good. Do you feel well enough to stand?
What did she mean?
And the passage to the barn?
From the belltower the day she before she died.
I hate him...
Of course you do. Who was it?
What about Roger? He's free.
I don't believe this. I don't bloody believe this.
Yes, that's because I'm getting to her.
I'll have it.
I thought cherry-vanilla was your favourite.
Did you have a good week Mama. Are they treating you all right?
Mama, that wasn't Marie, that was me!
You must have tons of questions. You may smoke if you want to. Just don't tell any of the Sisters.
Unfiltered.
We're examined once a year. Her pregnancy fell in between the doctor's visits.
I haven't a clue.
What's his name?
Father Martineau, but I don't see him as a candidate.
I am not with the Inquisition.
No... not in the eyes of the police.
One of the other nuns found out about the baby and... and wanted to avoid a scandal.
Well, it's been known to happen in the day too. Maybe Agnes went to him.
I was appalled, just as you are now.
And she has a right to know that there's a world out there filled with people who don't believe in God...  ... and aren't any worse off than you Mother. People who've gone through their entire lives without bending their knees once, to anybody. And people who fall in love and have babies and occas- sionally are very happy. She has a right to know that. But you and your... your order and your Church have kept her ignorant...
Oh, some time in January.
Take at look at it.
Sister Paul?
And Agnes' father?
She molested her!
Oh, dear God.
I knew that after the fact.
Don't deny it!
She's happy with us and she could go on being happy if she was left alone.
Catholic Church doesn't have a corner on morality...
I wasn't. I wasn't. She was the pretty one. She died, why not me?  I never said my morning prayers. And I was ugly, I was scrawny, I had buck teeth and freckles all over my face, do you know what the nun called me, Sister Mary Clitus, called me Polkadot Livingston.
Long, thin and filtered.
Do you want to become one?
Hasn't she had enough?
Was it you?
You went to the room to help with the birth.
What happened to the baby?
We'd be thrown out.
Your cards... lay them down... face up.
Gerron out of it, you're only jealous 'cause you're old.
And hurry, they're not looking too happy.
Get him out of here. He's knocking the programme's image!!
Oh, that's me other Grandfather, but this one's me Grandfather and all.
I don't really know, but it sounded distinguished, like, didn't it?
Sorry.
He comes from a large family.
I've got you worried, haven't I?
How'd you guess?
Aye, the big hammer, smashing!
What of? Look, I wouldn't do it unless I was. I'm dead lucky 'cos I get paid for doing something I love doing.
Quite right, invites to gambling dens full of easy money and fast women, chicken sandwiches and cornets of caviar, disgusting!
And that lot's never happier than when they're jeering at you ... and where would they be without the steady support of your drum beat, I'd like to know.
I'm soldier of the Republic, you'll need the mahogany truncheon for this boyo. A nation once again.
It's your nose, y'see. Fans are funny that way. Take a dislike to things. They'll pick on a nose...
Shurrup! Look, Mister, we've paid for our seats too, you know.
Foreign devil ...
No.
Oh you do, look.
Oh yes.
Thanks.
Aye, I suppose so.
Do I have to raise me voice?
Oh, all right. Come here, Grandad.
Yeah, down the ... er ...
Get knotted!
I'll set John on you!
Well, he can't stop here.
Nine hundred meters and dropping. 800.  700.  Hang on gentlemen.
No.  Just some horrible dreams about smothering.  Where are we?
Sandy, scan the whole sky.
Yeah.  Two hours.
Point eight six.  We can walk on it.
What's the terrain down there?
Looks like a derelict.
Yeah, I'm okay.  Haven't hit bottom yet.  Definitely a column of warm air rising; it keeps the shaft clear of dust.
Don't remember nothing.  Can't hardly remember my name.
What?  <u>Why</u>?
I have a temporary sequence on the monitor --
Shit...
Dead!
Hurt!  How?
Right.
Damn it!  How long to fix?
Well we better do something.
Isn't there some way we can get it off him?
We'd be sitting ducks in the freezers.
Boy, that's terrific.
Maybe we can catch it.
The only other thing I can think of is for somebody to crawl in there and flush it out.
Should we go outside and bring him in?
Can you get them back?
We can't spare the personnel.  We've got minimum takeoff capability right now.  That's why Chaz left us on board.
Three blips!  They're coming this way!
Hey!  what about the film?
It was horrible -- horrible.  Like a chicken.
I should hope so!  And we'd better make sure it's pretty far from the ship when we blow it.
Is it armed?
Sorry.  Nothing but that same damn transmission, every 32 seconds.  I've tried every frequency on the spectrum.
Sun will be down in a minute.
And you and I will bag it, and then we'll take it to the ventral air lock, got it?
Chaz, I've got something here on my security alert.  A high priority from the computer...
Engine room, what happened?
But?
But why draw it on the wall?
Look, I'm not trying to rub anybody's nose in anything.  The important thing is just to get away from here as fast as possible.
Let's take her into an escape orbit.
We're coming!
What do you think?  Now we go in.
Can we get to him?
Okay.  First we shut down all the cooling systems on the stardrive engines.
Doesn't matter -- we're already at light speed.  And when we get back to the Colonies, they'll pick us up in the network.
Here, carry these.
What can I do?
The head's okay, but I could sink a six-pack.
Yeah...
Get her on-line.  Now!
You win some, you loose some.
Alright, let's keep calm.  We've got to have an option of some sort... there's got to be a way out of this.
Deal.
C'mon De Vries.  Think of the bonus.
Yeah, I got it.
I dunno.  Might be a glitch.
No, he's stopped; he's totally still. Just take it nice and easy, babe. Nice and easy...
Thanks.
One final point.  Killing this sonuvabitch ought to be a reward in itself.  However, just to add a little incentive... I'm authorizing a hefty bonus in the next pay-packet for whoever does.
Uh-huh.
Sounds great.
Forget it.  I wouldn't ask somebody to do something I wouldn't do myself.  Where's the disk?
Blow those suckers, Driscoll!
We haven't used Big Bertha since we relocated the generator module. That was four months ago.  I can't ask for them to keep bringing spares in on the shuttle, it's already costing too much as it is.
No, not really.  More sort of the  'claustrophobic' type.
Nothing.  With the satellite down, we can't transmit over the mountain range. He's most likely sitting there wondering why he can't raise us.
Sure.  Do me good to stretch my legs.
Do you think Ackland'll sit tight?
Check out the tent.
Ah, don't worry about I.C.C.  They're the least of your problems right now.
Why not? Tell me, Phoebe, do you want some day to have an award like that of your own?
San Francisco. An oasis of civilization in the California desert. Tell me, do you share my high opinion of San Francisco?
Heart to heart? Woman to woman? Including a casual reference to the part of "Cora" - and your hopes of playing it.
Just like that.
Frankly - yes.
It is possible - even conceivable - that you've confused me with that gang of backward children you've been playing tricks on - that you have the same contempt for me that you have for them?
Yes, Addison.
Max has gone to a great deal of trouble, it's going to be an elaborate party, and it's for you.
That's how you met me. In passing.
You next move, it seems to me, should be toward television.
Then you've heard too.
Margo? Lunching in public?
Dear Margo. You were an unforgettable Peter Pan - you must play it again, soon. You remember Miss Caswell?
The ladies' - shall we say - lounge?
I consider it highly unnatural to allow a girl in an advanced state of pregnancy-
Completely. Nor, I am sure, could anyone else present tell you how Miss Caswell read or whether Miss Caswell read or rode a pogo stick.
The air lines have clocks, even if you haven't! I start shooting a week from Monday - Zanuck is impatient, he wants me, he needs me!
Right here. A minute ago.
We know you, we've seen you before like this. Is it over - or just beginning?
Where's my coat?
I understand they've got the Indians pretty well in hand...
Then you're crazy.
Of course, birthday and welcome home... who'll I ask?
The audition.
The kid. Junior.
Gone.
I mix what I like.
I'll say.
Glory Hallelujah.
You've got it backwards. Even for Wilkes-Barre.
Just wondered what?
It's only one picture deal.
Yeah. They keep you under drugs out there with armed guards...
Goodbye, Mr. Sampson.
A diamond collar, gold sleeves - you know, picture people...
But the wardrobe women have got one. And next to a tenor, a wardrobe woman is the touchiest thing in show business-
She's got two things to do - carry clothes an' press 'em wrong - an' just let anybody else muscle in...
Hmm?
Like an agent with one client.
You're not being funny, I could get actors for less. What about the food?
You're Margo Channing's best friend. You and your husband are always with her - and Mr. Sampson... what's he like?
Try...
Not just that way. As a friend...
Karen.
I don't let myself think about it, even-  - but I do know the part so well, and every bit of the staging, there'd be no need to break in a new girl-  - but suppose I had to go on one night? To an audience that came to see Margo Channing. No, I couldn't possibly...
The reason is Margo and don't try to figure it out. Einstein couldn't.
- and you felt just like that talking to Addison.
Do you expect me to believe that you didn't say any of those things - that they were all Addison?
No! I don't expect you to believe anything. Except that the responsibility is mine. And the disgrace.
I hope so, Mr. Richards. Good night...
Well, teacher's away and actors will be actors...
I can imagine... you know, all it needed was some taking in here and letting out there - are you sure you won't want it yourself?
I've got it.
Really, Eve? Why?
Why not?
Any houses or farms around where we can borrow gas?
It seems to me that walking, for most people, is not very dangerous.
Be brave. He'll come back - with or without gas.
It doesn't matter.
I detest cheap sentiment.
We're never deeply angry, we just get sore. The way you do. We know you too well...
What about Bill?
Those years stretch as the years go on. I've seen it happen too often.
This. I can't tell you how sorry I am!
But not right away? First the business of fighting them off, chin up, stout fella...
Just a little skid, that's all. This road's like glass.
I guess I didn't look. You know I don't pay attention to those things...
No, I got the idea myself - while she was talking to me...
It strikes me that Eve's disloyalty and ingratitude must be contagious!
I have no possible interest in anything she'd have to say.
What is he talking about?
She was a revelation...
It's right to the point. Also that it must have sounded so new and fresh to you - so exciting to have the lines read as you wrote them!
Then you listened as if someone else had written you play - whom did you have in mind? Sherwood? Arthur Miller? Beaumont and Fletcher?
Usually at the point when she's got to rewrite and rethink them to keep the audience from leaving the theater!
We are ready with the call you placed for 12 midnight, California time, to Mr. William Sampson in Beverly Hills...
"Liebestraum."
I feel right now like there's one burning in me.
Anything to help you out, Max.
--I have to stand here and listen to the staff correspondent from Virginia?--
--mine's better--
--read 'em both and you'll see--
I was sure trying.
What do you think he meant, this particular incident? Were there others? How would we find out? You know anyone important?
The fucking New York Times.
--I'm trying--
Alphabetically, on the CREEP phone list, Miss Helen Abbott of South George Street.
Sure.
--shit--
--because a year before, the Republicans weren't ahead, not in the polls, Muskie was running ahead of Nixon then. Before he self- destructed.
Segovia begged me for me secret but I said, "No, Andres, you'll have to try and make it without me."
What's the matter?
Hmm?
--jeeeeeeeeesus--
Oh.
I'd really like to see Mr. Dardis.
I think it might be helpful if you'd send me to Miami.
You're a sex junkie, you know that, Carl?
This girlfriend of mine at the Committee, the other day she went back to the D.A. to tell the things the FBI didn't ask her. That night, her boss, he knew what she'd done. They control everything; that's how they know it all.
If you don't like it down there, why don't you quit?
I'm relaxed--light your cigarette.
--they're worse. That's why I quit.
We were never told flat out "Don't talk." But the message was clear.
--this'll only take one second--
I'm not your source on that.
And we'll all have to go to work for a living.
--Christ, I wish I knew if we should print this--
How senior?
--his dialing finger must be falling off--
There is no reason to assume other people were involved.
Barker's wife called me at three this morning; her husband apparently had told her to call if he hadn't called her by then.
Where?  What do you mean, where?
Because the press stinks too--history on the run, that's all you're interested in.  You come up with anything?
This man Gordon Liddy--he's going to be tried along with Hunt and the five burglars--we know he knows a lot, we just don't know what.
What's the whole thing about--do you know?
What I know, you'll have to find out on your own.
Liddy--you think there's a chance he'll talk?
Who?--be specific. How high up?
You get nothing from me about Haldeman?
Follow every lead--every lead goes somewhere--
Good God!
I think so.
It is.
Ask him what he's really saying--he means take the story away from Woodstein and give it to his people at the National Desk--
That's everything Bachinski had, I think it's worth following up.
--in other words, you got nothing, you're thumbsucking.
Could develop.
One Senator just gave a speech slurring us 57 times in 20 minutes.
Of course--everything they asked--
Suck me...beautiful?
No, no, that's what the cretins drink. I mean alcohol, liquor -- good stuff.
Aged eighteen years.  Why don't you get the glasses.  Behind the bar.
Whatever you hear about me, you agree.
Just enjoying my exhilarating first lacrosse experience.  You like, "kicked butt."
Come on!  I won't tell.
Yeah, me too, okay, cool.
I wasn't making fun of you.
Onions?
What?
Yeah.  So wow, you've got it figured out.
Then don't.
I'll give you a hint.  "Ohhh, yeah, yeah!"  Comprende?
You mean...and orgasm?
You got it, stud.
Do you?
Well it's up to you.  The Big L, or the Big O.
No comment?!  Are you kidding me?! I've never seen someone's image change so...so drastically!
Their tiger-style kung-fu is strong; but our dragon style will defeat it!
Right.  That gives us...
Just in time.
You fuckin' rule!
Yes.
So let's say you get there...what's uh, third base feel like?
Perhaps you can help me with my studies?
Well...uh...
Nadia, I can't --
No!  I've got...reserve reserves!
Me?  Nothing.  I'm the one whose ass he kicked.  I'll tell you one thing, though.  I don't think he's gonna have a problem shitting in school anymore.
You think so?
Vicky -- do you think, maybe...it's time for us to take the next step in our relationship?
Tonight?
Not for you.
It's everyone's trick, Kevin.  But I did pick it up from you.
No, I don't not love you.  I like, I know that we've definitely got <u>something</u> between us.  Something good. Something special.
Okay.
It did.
I know.  Let's go.  Don't you have something to tell your friends?
Your little pact.  Jessica told me all about it.  Way to go, Kev!
Well, no.  I think...I guess it would be good to be able to return the favor.  I mean, it would be nice to know she enjoys things as much as I do.
It's early Springsteen, dude, this is classic.  This was before the cheesy remake.
I'm such a loser.
I don't care.
Hah!  Yeah, Oz, I bet it's more like your dad works at <u>her</u> store.
No way.
What a coincidence, I am someone!  Mmm. Calvin Klein's Obsession. Now it's mine too.
Uh huh... And, supposing I believed that, what could I do about it?
What, all of a sudden you got a degree in supernatural law?
Fine. My mistake. You know, I'm gonna be a writer myself some day.
In an underground club? I'd like to see that.
Yeah... Ditto. I saw, er, I thought I saw you get munched... like Uncle Terrence...
Go to Jim Morrison's grave at Pere Lachaise. It's overrun with American tourists. I have to work.
A la votre.
Professor Roussel. There's something wrong with you. I know it.
Roussel? You mean Claude? You're calling Dr. Demento so he can come paint my face again? Fuck that.
What?! He told you? When?
Andy! No!
No. We have to try. We'll figure something out. And if midnight comes before we can get to him, well, then we go together. Deal?  Shake a paw?
All your weapons, on the floor! Now!
Shut up! Save your stories. The only thing I want to hear is you begging for your life. I want to see you suffer, like they did.  Haha! You're scared now, eh? Come on. Where's the scary monster now huh? Ha ha... We'll see who -
Yeah well, that's like really groovy and everything, but who hacked my uncle's legs off?
Uncle Terrence.
Not too well. He taught at the Sorbonne, right? Dad always calls him his "hippie brother". Did some work with Timothy Leary I think, and - Is he... is he going to die?
Just the name of this hospital, St. Severin. He repeated it a few times then he lost consciousness.
Not that I know.
No we can't. That's the problem. God knows it would beat hanging around with you!
Don't worry. In a few seconds you won't feel a thing.
Puking on yourself in midair is not a good death.
Oh, did I hurt the little girl's feelings? Well excusez moi... I confess my desire for ADM is quite "intense". So I deceived you and our poor friend Terry - a competent technician, but let's face it, a bit naive. "The great cure for lycanthropy!" Hmph. He didn't have the vision to grasp the potential of ADAM, until it was too late. And even then, he came rushing down to tell me, as if I would be just as shocked! Ha.
I need two tactical assault squads at Place Denfert immediately. You can tell the commissioner it's a code red.
Hmmph. At least now there's one person around here who doesn't think I'm crazy.
You never heard the story of Saint Severin driving the werewolves from Paris?
I thought you were told not to tutor your servants anymore.
Ah ... the Lady Sophie... The ravishing first cousin, once removed, from the Empress. We must convince Sophie that you are the Princess before we'll be granted a meeting with the Empress ... your grandmother, I mean.
Yes, your highness.
Poor Meetoo!
I'm sorry. . .  I'm. . .
What happened to your parents?
Anastasia's grandmother is in Paris.  We're going to bring Anastasia to her - in Paris. 
Why?
The dessert fork!
Sad?
Hey! It doesn't matter! You gotta make your own way in the world! Don't be sorry for me! I'm going to get what I want don't you worry!
No! Well, yes, but
No, it wasn't a bat! I saw this horrible man - I remember him, I think...
No, no child... shush... it's all right ...
"If" I accept?! Of course I'm going to accept! it's what I always wanted!
Pray he's color-blind...
The same thing I wanted ten years ago - all the Romonovs dead I got the others, now I have to finish up with that nuisance, Anastasia...
STOP IT! I DID SO KILL THEM! And I'm going to kill Anastasia.
You! How dare you?! Stop this car immediately!
Young	man, I...
No. Yeah, once in a while. You know, like occasionally.
You were on... uh, the... uh, the Johnny Carson, right?
Once in a while, you know. I mean, you know, every now-
Yeah, I do. It's for my girl friend. Make it out to Ralph.
I took a meeting with Freddy. Freddy took a meeting with Charlie. You take a meeting with him.
What is so incredibly great about New York? It's a dying city! You-you read "Death in Venice".
What do you mean, next?
Uh ... I mean you're on right after this act.
L-L-Lyndon Johns Lyndon Johnson is a politician. You know the ethics those guys have? It's like-uh, a notch underneath child molester.
You're using this conspiracy theory as an excuse to avoid sex with me.
Oh, my God!  She's right! Why did I turn off Allison Portchnik? She was-she was beautiful. She was willing. She was real... intelligent.  Is it the old Groucho Marx joke? That-that I-I just don't wanna belong to any club that would have someone like me for a member?
You wanna get coffee for two hours or something? We'll go next-
I don't know now. You-you wanna go to another movie?  So let's go see The Sorrow and the Pity.
You? You kiddin'?  If the Gestapo would take away your Bloomingdale's charge card, you'd tell 'em everything.
Yeah, 'cause it's supposed to.
Oh, all right. All right! It's all right. Here.
Get him!
Oh, really? Well, la-de-da!
Well, no... not just, not only.
Oh, yeah? So do you. Oh, God, whatta-  whatta dumb thing to say, right? I mean, you say it, "You play well," and right away... I have to say well. Oh, oh... God, Annie.  Well... oh, well... la-de-da, la-de- da, la-la.
Oh, no, I have a car.
Wisconsin.
You want your tennis stuff?
Yeah, my grammy.
Oh, yeah, yeah.
Y-y-yeah, just for fifteen years.
Fifteen-aw, come on, you're... yeah, really?
M'hm...
Interesting poetess whose tragic suicide was misinterpreted as romantic, by the college-girl mentality.
Neat, yeah.
You know, I gotta get there and begin whining soon... otherwise I- Hey... well, are you busy Friday night?
Oh, I'm sorry, wait a minute, I have something. Well, what about Saturday night?
it's my first time.
And-and uh, there's gonna be all that tension. You know, we never kissed before and I'll never know when to make the right move or anything. So we'll kiss now we'll get it over with and then we'll go eat. Okay?
And blind people, crippled...
I don't-don't know how they get through life. It's amazing to me.
Oh, that's hilarious. They're back from Fire Island. They're... they're sort of giving it a chance-you know what I mean?
No, I'm serious.  I just got my mustache wet.
No, I'm not.
That's the key question.
How- I don't want you to live with me? How- Whose idea was it?
It relaxes me.
No, I'm fine.
Oh, I'm really, uh, looking forward to tomorrow. I mean, you know, I think that it'll be really nice to meet Mother and Father.
What's the difference? It's all mental masturbation.
Tsch. Rea- All this happened in the first hour?
Oh, I told her my dream and then I cried.
Sinatra had gl- You never said Sinatra had glasses. So whatta you saying that I-I'm suffocating you?
And what are you doing following me around for, anyway?
Oh, humdinger. When- Well, I got a wonderful idea. Why don'tcha get the guy who took you to the rock concert, we'll call him and he can come over and kill the spider. You know, it's a-
Yeah, where is the spider?
Yeah?
Oh, don't go, okay? Please.
I mean was there another- I thought I heard a voice.
Oh, no, no, I think we're both much too mature for something like that.
I don't know.
Alvy, what about... what if we go away this weekend, and we could-
Oh, the thing! Oh, the thing...  ...yeah... yeah.
I don't know, I thought it might be kind of fun, you know what I mean, it'd be nice to meet some new people.
I don't know, though, I feel so guilty because Alvy is paying for it, so, you know, so I do feel guilty if I don't go to bed with him. But if I do go to bed with him, it's like I'm going against my own feelings. I don't know I-I can't win.
Remember that day?
Thanks, honey.
We can always come back together again. Because there's no-there's no problem. 'Cause... Right.
Exactly, but... exactly. Ooooh!
Hey, this one's mine, this button. This one, you rem-
The Grammys. He's got a lotta records up for awards.
I thought just earplugs.
Six-year-old boys don't have girls on their minds.
Oh, you got a headache!
I can't get with any religion that advertises in Popular Mechanics. Look-  there's God coming outta the men's room.
Who said that?
It's the influence of television. Yeah, now Marshall McLuhan deals with it in terms of it being a-a high, uh, high intensity, you understand?  A hot medium... as opposed to a...
Wait a minute! Really? Really? I happen to teach a class at Columbia called "TV Media and Culture"! So I think that my insights into Mr. McLuhan- well, have a great deal of validity.
Why, Max? It's a good name for you. Max, you see conspiracies in everything.
Max, the city is terribly worried.
You'll total the whole car.
Yeah, well, I used to lose my glasses a lot.
Yeah, and always over the most ridiculous things.
While you're out here, Max, I want you to see some of my TV show. And we're invited to a big Christmas party.
Yeah, well, that's why this machine is dynamite.
Oh, Jesus.
No, no-my, you know, my stomach felt queasy all morning. I just started getting...
Oh, Max... no, I maybe I better lie down.
What difference does that make?
There are no twos, Max.
How do you like this couple, Max?
His wife has diabetes!
They're persecuted enough!
Oh, I can imagine. P-p-probably the wife of an astronaut.
Then there was Jerry, the actor.
If only I didn't feel guilty asking Annie to move out. It'd probably wreck her. But I should be honest.
We really had a good time.
Oh, yes, yes.
I don't know, this is strange to me, you know.
Yeah.
I was very charming.
Oh, I was quite a lively dancer.
Oh yes.
A triumph.  When did you get here?
You're fucking desperate.
She's a constant surprise.
Yeah, I know... But she's only twenty seven and...  The wisdom.  She's an old soul.  She knew that Shostakovich thing.  Did you notice?
The movie.
Who, Sally?
Leo?
Five years ago, I was at the party, remember?
What what's about?
Didn't I say?
Well, probably.
I'm fine.  I'm fine.  Well, I'm a little stressed.  And I've been taking pills to get my weight down since the baby.
I'd love a Xanex.  Sally, please don't tell Sophia that I'm not breast feeding.
You need to knock off the pills, Clair.
Just don't fucking tell her.
Dander.  He's allergic.  Otis.
Are you the funniest person I know, or what?
He's not going tonight.
No, not anymore.  Happy anniversary, scout.
Can I open it?
Sally?
I should have damn well bought it.  Well, we can't afford it.  The movie's going to eat up a year of my life and I'm getting paid next to nothing.  Do you know how much Skye Davidson's getting?  Four million.
But she's alright.
Fuck you.
Ya Vhol.  What are you, a fucking Nazi?
Oh yeah... I'm gonna save you.
So, you've got lifeguard papers, or what?
I adore him.
I know.  I know that.  Don't spoil it.
Whatever you say.
I'm ready.
Happy anniversary.
They can't find a sitter...  Hello?  Excuse me?  Yes, uh, hold on.  Just a moment.  It's Skye Davidson.  She needs directions to the house.  You invited Skye fucking Davidson to our anniversary party?
You invited her to our anniversary party? I didn't even invite my mother.
She goes on location tomorrow.  Sally, I'm sorry.  Look, I can't keep her on hold.
You want me to uninvite her?
No, no of course not.  How old is she? Twenty-fucking-two?
Truce?
Truce.
Whatever!  You know how he gets.  Well, he went absolutely bonkers.  Lucy and I were frantically trying to scramble into the dumb waiter and I didn't fit any more. It was almost fatal.  And that, my dear friends, is the day...
There are fucking coyotes out there.
And how hard it hit?
It is true.  You know how you love, Joe? You dedicate a book to someone.
Not really.  I mean your books have always been pop, but this is the shallowest of the bunch.  That's what all our friends think, anyway.
Who?  Who?  Who thinks that?
Your director and your co-star of your current movie.  Don't dish if you can't take it, Sally.
You're not ready.
Congratulations on the deal.  How exciting.  Is Sally doing Sally?  I mean it's Sally.  The character that's based on Sally.  The character that's based on Sally in the book.
But I am right, yes?  She's based on Sally.
No.
Yes I did.
Do I put you off?
You manage to throw me off balance.  I adore you.
Kind of.  Hey, look - John Seale, Oliver Stapelton, Darius Khonji - they're friends.  And great DP's I could give them a call for you.
Oh don't.  Everyone says that.
But you're very private people.  You know, there's a kind of elitism...
Well, that's what Ryan thought.  I was more generous, actually.
I don't think so.  I feel.  I feel a bit funny.
Lemon it is.
Nine...nine, yes?  Nine years, just about.
Oh, I love that.  I'm just great.  I'm so happy to be here. And I apologize for invading you.  And I'm so happy you asked me to.  I'm so touched.  I know how private you and Sally are.
No, it's not... Fuck fuck fuck fuck.
I'm not going to leave you alone.
Because we're nice people, and because what goes around comes around.  Because, God help you if something happens to that dog?
Do you need anything else?
No, no thanks.
Oh?
The Shostakovich.
No, I'm just testing to see how deeply perverted and impulsive you are.
Really?  I need a drink.  Come hide with me.
It could be worse.
We're just feeling our way back.
Shit.  It's my Galiano.
I'm worried about your Galiano.
Why not?
In the guest room.  I've laid out a paint table for them.
So where should I put it?
So how much do you hate her?
She took our wedding photos, for chrissakes.  You don't trust anyone.
You are not having your baby in London. You're going to have your baby at Cedars in Beverly Hills, America, delivered by Dr. Milton Cohen.  Period. And you're getting that epidural right away, don't let anyone talk you into any of that Lamase bullshit.  There's no excuse for pain like that.
Oh honey, let's.
No, no, not at all... I mean I've still got plenty of time.  Don't I?  I mean I still have a good six years, whatever. We could have three kids yet, if we wanted.  And I know I've always said I never wanted kids, and I didn't... but this year, I really, truly, feel ready...
Why are you doing this?
I'm new...I was born yesterday.
Wanna dance?
Well, if single-handedly vanquishing the enemy and slaughtering a whole nestful of termites makes someone a hero, yes I am.
No...as a matter of fact...
I CAN'T DANCE WITH A WORKER!
There's something going on, Z --
Of course --
Mom!
Our platoon has the best assignment of all.  We're the first into battle!
Superior numbers, kid!
No, no, you're...lookin' good. You've got good color in your cheeks.
Yeah...I mean...well...I don't know, really, sir.
Yes, and do you know <u>why</u> there's a food shortage?
I do not recollect, your majesty. Will that be all?
Yes, General Formica.  Carry on, my good man!  I don't know what we would do without you.
They should be...  But there's something funny about that soldier.
Z, we've known each other a long time, right?
You heard the ant -- DIG!!!
I almost didn't recognize you -- this is the first time I've ever seen you in civilian clothes.
This date -- is it just a date -- or is it something serious?
Oh, I even know who you live with -- your sister and brother-in- law -- I know when you were born -- and where -- I know all sorts of things about you.
What gave you that idea?
You're so right.
Nothing.  There are just too many people here.
No -- I like it.
After all, this is a conservative firm -- I don't want people to think I'm an entertainer --
All right. Have a nice Christmas.
It's not important, Fran -- the main thing is that I got here in time -- and you're going to be all right --  -- isn't she, Doc?
Where's my dress? I have to go home.
Oh -- of course. I think there's a new toothbrush somewhere.
And where are you now?
He's a liar. But that's not the worst part of it -- the worst part is -- I still love him.
Open it.
Give what up?
I don't like myself very much anyway.
Gin.
Who'd care?
I would.
-- Mr. Sheldrake.
Sure.  What's that funny smell?
Yes. I was boiling some water to get the coffee stains out of my dress.
Are you supposed to?
In this house, you're supposed to.
Over a girl?
No, I don't.
I don't?
Oh.
Aren't you meeting Mr. Sheldrake?
I'm warning you, Mr. Baxter -- this is a respectable house, not a honky-tonky.  Come on, Oscar.
What for?
Who?
Loyal, cooperative, resourceful C. C. Baxter.
Oh.
Well, I don't want to intrude -- and I thought -- since it's all straightened out anyway --
So do I -- I'm going to take four aspirins and get into bed -- so you better give the tickets to somebody else --
Oh?  Oh!
Now put down the key --  -- and put down the address.
Thank you, sir.
Fine. And I want you to know I'll work very hard to justify your confidence in me -- SHELDRAKE Sure you will.  Say, Baxter, about the apartment - now that you got a raise, don't you think we can afford a second key?
You know my secretary -- Miss Olsen --
I didn't want to tell you over the phone but that certain party -- you know who I mean -- I found her here last night -- she had taken an overdose of sleeping pills.
It's about Miss Kubelik -- she's all right again -- so she went back home.
Don't mind what?
What do you mean, sorry?
You're not going to bring anybody up to my apartment.
Yes?
I don't mind in the summer -- but on a rainy night -- and I haven't had any dinner yet --
Sure, sure.  Look, kid -- I put in a good word for you with Sheldrake, in Personnel.
I'm a pretty good operator myself -- but she just won't give me a tumble -- date-wise.
Could be she's just a nice, respectable girl -- there are millions of them.
No!
I did, didn't I? I distinctly remember bending over and putting it there --
It is?  Well, how about that? No wonder I couldn't get into the executive washroom this morning.
Well, after all, it's my apartment -- it's private property -- it's not a public playground.
That's not like you, Baxter. Just the other day, at the staff meeting, I was telling Mr. Sheldrake what a reliable man you were.
Sometimes,  there's a twi-night double-header.  A nebbish like you!
I don't know -- I mean -- I wasn't here -- you see -- we had some words earlier -- nothing serious, really -- what you might call a lovers' quarrel --
It's just that she's got a family -- and there's the people in the office -- look, Doc, can't you forget you're a doctor -- let's just say you're here as a neighbor --
Happy New Year.
That so.
All I wanted him to do was let Mickey out for Christmas.
I don't know you at all. BUD Permit me -- C.C. Baxter -- junior executive, Arthur Murray graduate, lover.
Kubelik.
That's right, Fran. And I'm a doctor.
Do you know where you are, Fran?
So you don't have to play innocent with me. He used to tell his wife that I was the branch manager from Seattle -- four years ago when we were having a little ring-a-ding- ding.
Six weeks. But who's counting?
You don't know what it's like -- standing next to you in that elevator, day after day -- Good morning, Miss Kubelik -- Good night, Mr. Sheldrake -- I'm still crazy about you, Fran.
Why do you keep calling me, Jeff? What do you want from me?
You didn't really believe me, did you?
I wasn't trying.
I saw my lawyer this morning -- I wanted his advice  -- about the best way to handle it --
I'm sure. If you'll just tell me that you still love me --
You know I do.
Now, Fran --
Okay, okay, Fran. I deserve that. But just ask yourself -- why does a man run around with a lot of girls? Because he's unhappy at home -- because he's lonely, that's why -- all that was before you, Fran -- I've stopped running.
There you go again -- you know I didn't mean it that way, Fran. Just get well -- do what the nurse tells you -- I mean Baxter -- and I'll see you as soon as I can. Bye, Fran. 
Atlantic City?
He wouldn't give me the key to the apartment.
First you can't wait to get me up here, and now -- rush, rush, rush! Makes a person feel cheap.
What guy?  Whose apartment is this, anyway?
Don't you ever stop talking?
Lovely. You were a big help.
Yeah --
What is this?
Thirty -- sometimes fifty.
A year ? Waiter another beer.
Why they call you that?
That's right, sir -- I come from New Orleans -- I was raised to be a sauciere.. a great sauciere. We specialize in sauces; my whole family. It's what we do. I was supposed to go to Paris and study at the Escoffier School; I was saving the money. They called me for my physical so I figured the Navy had better food.
What are you doing out here?
I don't believe you --
Whatdoya think it thinks.
Not a thing.
... he's an amazing officer.
I'll go with you in a while -- judt hold tight awhile --
All right I got a little surprise for you --
We found some bodies -- let's get out a here.
Yeah -- like keep out --
Clear on starboard -- Where's Lance an' the Captain?
Would he remember you ?
No, it'd be spooky without the war -- give 'em back.
He was the tragedy -- the tragedy of this war.
Colonel Kurtz, he's dead.
Okay, Willard, sit down.
This gentleman or myself ?
This is years ago, before he joined Special Forces, I guess. We had an argument.
Captain?
We endure, captain -- you can blow up the house and we will live in the cellar -- destroy that and we'll dig a hole in the jungle and sleep on it. Burn the forest and we'll hide in the swamp. all the while, we do but one thing -- clean the blood off our bayonets.  Au revoir, Captain.
That's terrible -- we'll change that -- I'd like to see you work -- I've always liked your cutback; got a hell of a left turn, too.
Boss left.
Yeah -- Na Trang told me to expect you -- we'll see what we can do. Just stay out of my way till this is done, Captain.
You'll find enough Cong up there.
Music?
The trees, eh...
We were attacked -- down river. We need supplies and medical help.
No -- no, sir.
What Truth?
I'll tell you what makes sense ! Air strikes ! White Phosphorus ! Napalm ! We'll bomb the shit out of them if they don't do what we want.
I was on threshold of great things.
You knew him best.
Just something I read in the Free Press.
He can't kill us.  We're on his side.
Want to say goodbye to the Colonel?
Then let's get the hell out of here.
Which one's the Colonel's?
I wasn't looking.. I was running.
No -- leave it --
Why did they attack us?
Kurtz. I tell you, that man has enlarged my mind.
No, Colonel Kurtz couldn't be crazy -- if you heard him talk, just last week, you'd never think he was crazy.
Those heads, yes. Well, the rebels...
I do.
139  CONTINUED:
Keep back.
Back against the bars.  Now.
How did she..?
Where'd you say Eric is?
He still might be around.  I saw fresh tire tracks coming in.
Going after killers isn't the same as chasing poachers, Eric.
That's not what I meant.
Look, why get into this again. As long as it's working, let's leave it alone.  It's been nice so far.  We're together --
Do I want to be with you permanently?  Yes, I think I do. But be with what you do and the way you live?  That I don't know. C'mon, Eric, until I met you, coming back to Alaska was totally
That's my line.
Let's keep going.  We're only an hour from Devil's Cauldron.
Kenai at the general store asked me to bring these.  Didn't expect we'd already met.
No big deal.  We just got off on the wrong foot.  What's your name?
Yeah.  Maybe so.
-- To take you to jail?  It'll be my pleasure.
We're not sitting here 'til November.  There's a cargo plane coming to Devil's Cauldron in four days, and I'm putting you on it.
It could blow over tomorrow, too.
Told that's what our old man was. Planned on going to sea, me and Bob, 'til I read Jack London. Started trapping when I was ten. Mailed the furs to Sears.  Eight bucks for a skunk, three for a muskrat.  That was fine money.
I already have.
The time has passed for men like them and me.  I know it.  But they're still fighting for survival, like cornered animals. That's why they'll kill you. -more-
Wound's a through-and-through. Missed my liver, I think.
Just passing through.
I'm not too old to knock the snot out of you!
Sure.
Snowplow, generator, TV dish... hell, we get the goddamn Playboy Channel!  Here, this is for you.
Have you heard anything from the girl staying with me, Anne Marie?
This isn't your concern.  It's over, here and now.
Any idea who could've done it?
I could've sat tight for the transport, 'til Bob came poking around.
Bet I could make some money turning Ben Corbett in.  Maybe more for lettin' him loose.  I was up in my cache.  Saw the Northland man come talk to you.
So shoot him.  Won't have to feed him that way --
You met the gift.
It lets a crazy man into our lives.
Come on. Why fight when we know how it will come out. This isn't like stocking or a string of pearls. You don't send this one back.
I still don't feel safe leaving Spencer with someone. How do you spell it again?
Go ahead.
Me. My home number is on this card.
You're gonna die soon with that diet, you know that?
It's okay -- I'll sit here.
How old are you?
Otherwise, you're not ugly.
You all set here?
I'm not going to sleep with you. I will never, ever sleep with you. Never. Not ever.
Okay!!!! Anything else?!?
Just how grateful I am.
Yes.
What you did changed my life.
Lovely.
The stiff one eye?
Bettes tells me he's doing fine.
Is there another way to see it?
You promised a nice place -- can't you just...  You have these dry cleaned all the time, don't you?
Fries.
Then I've really overshot here 'cause I was aiming at just enough to keep you from walking out.
I don't know why I brought you -- that idea occurred to me is all... It came out first... Hey, you kiss him -- me... He says he loves you. You two hit it off. But you don't want to... fine... Forget what I said about sex with Simon. It was a mistake.
To hell with sex.
So long.
I'm sorry... I can't hear you. I can't turn my head all the way yet... tell her we can't hear her.
No, let me pull over so I can pay full attention.
Good night.
No. No. Get Carol.
You changed the room around...
Hope you find him. I love that dog.
Shhhh now. I like Simon. I like him enough to batter you unrecognizable if you verbally abuse him or so much as touch his dog again. Meanwhile, I'll try and think how you can make this up to him.  I hate doing this. I'm an art dealer.  Have a nice day. Party!
I'm not saying nothing to you.
He's a pain in the ass.
If there's some mental health foundation that raises money to help people like you be sure to let me know.
What?
Wait here.
No, it's all right. I'll just watch.
Oh, is he dead?
'Love was... '
Verdell?
Where are all your queer party friends?
Look, I've got to get a hold of Frank and see where I'm hanging my hat 'cause...
I'm coming.
That somebody out there knows what it's like to be...  in here.
Didn't you here all them sirens? It's been all over the radio.  Some guy shot Leevio Valli, and a bunch of bystanders, in the Trattoria Roma.
Probably.
No fucking way.
We both know what you were doing.
What?  What's okay?
Why don't you tell me.
I'm sorry, sir.  A year ago there was a fire in the old Hotel Paraiso. This is the new Hotel Paraiso.
I know.  It was a joke.
Fuck you, fuck Cleveland, and fuck your contracts --
What?  How did you know I had a cat?
Took a guess.  Lucky for you, I guessed right.
I work for the government.
No, stay in the car.  I want you to understand something.  If I intended to kill you, you would already be dead.
You're the computer hacker, you tell me.
Yellow Pages.  V for veterinarian. There aren't that many.
If I still was what I used to be, you would not be pointing that at me.
Someone hired both of you?
No.  They hired Bain.  The contract would have been mine, but Bain took it from me as he took the previous one.
Why?
Yes.
Right.
Then you can have the disks and I'll just walk out that door --
Rath.  Robert Rath.
He was Russian.  Nicholai Tachlinkov.  A legend in the business when I was just starting. I admired him.  When I heard he loved chess I became obsessed with the game.
We played with a code using <u>The New</u> <u>York Times</u> obituaries.  Over three years we played twelve matches.  I never won.
You were like a boy genius?
No.  I graduated from George Washington University.  Then I entered the Agency training program.
Did it ever bother James Bond?
That's fiction.
Oh.  What do you think about?
I don't know... maybe I'll live on a boat, sail to all the places I've never been.
Here?
Okay.
Thank you.
That's right.
It wasn't planned or premeditated. I swear.  Things happened beyond my control.  I understood; I saw where they were leading and I suppose that it just made sense.
What did he want?
I didn't notice them.
Isn't it interesting though?  I mean, look at us, in this room.  Or yesterday, when we were walking in the plaza market.  I mean, we look like just another couple.  But what are we?  Doesn't it seem so crazy?
No.
It's always been that way.  The world has always functioned on two levels.
Who was she?
Right.
What?
God damnit, Electra.  This is not a game.  This is business.
Holidays are our busiest days.  No one likes to be alone on holidays. I know I don't.
Sometimes.
Average.
That's exactly what I told myself.
What do other guys do?
Yeah.
I used to think about it.  I had Margaret.  She wanted kids.  I thought about moving somewhere far away like, Europe.  I could see all of that, the first part, the getting away but I couldn't see that next part.  'Then what?' So I'd stop thinking about it and go back to work.  You understand?
I have all day.
It won't last, believe me. And you, when will you go back to the States?
Yeah, let's check out the low-life.
Yeah and they manage to go to bourgeois joints!
No, it's the whole idea behind it. How did they get this place?
Squatted it.
So? DOUG Well, there's tons of empty buildings - why don't we get one?
You've got to stop using that word "we" it's getting kind of scary. Right Katka?
Too right....Now the other thing we've got to do is start clearing up the rubble. Can you make a start on that?
Later Mate, right now I've got to do the locks on these doors so we don't have to climb through that bloody window every time.
I thought that was part of the charm!
No.....But I think Honza at the office has. You keep shifting this crap and I'll take care of the locks, shouldn't take long. Take a break for lunch and I'll catch you up later.
No, just making my contribution to cultural enlightenment, that's all.
Yeah, I'm beginning to see that.
Just save me a little patch and I'll do it later.
Don't we have enough already?
Sounds like a good reason to leave it alone.
We got a party tomorrow night. Can't have the place smelling like shit.
What's that, five instead of ten years jail.
So why didn't we?
It just happened.
You might make Henry happy......Sure, I'll do it.
You capitalist pig!
Now you're using that word.
Lucky break!
And if you're wrong.
Get me one of the disks. Ask a Czech girl to smuggle it in to me this evening. Put the others in a locker and write the details in a note to Reuters and be ready to send it, if this doesn't work. You'd better keep clear of your apartment too. Do you know someone with a phone?
You could give me your baseball, so I can drive this bastard nuts.....He's been playing chequers for eight hours and still hasn't won a game.
I'm not hungry, really.
Josh didn't get Doug out of jail, he did a deal in return for some computer disks we'd held onto.
Sure I'm sure!
Good we'll take Josh's Jeep, come on!
Yeah....Shit, those guys have guns.
Turn around quick!
They didn't look like medical files to me.
Well a plea of ignorance won't go far here. Frankly, I think you deserve everything that's coming.
Regards to Her Majesty.
I've been around.
Yeah, maybe.
But I don't want to go, I am enjoying it.
Then tell me, what will happen? Tell me!
Look, I love you Katka but I'm twelve years older, I could never marry you, it'd be stupid, you know that!
Well, I want them to put down a floor and a walkway.
It's not so much.
Yep, it's all yours.
Don't worry. Thanks.
Yes, of course...maybe one hour.
That's only the half of it. I've heard a rumour they're taking over a theatre to use for alternative arts; you know what that means?
A month, Jesus! And how do I know you're not crapping me?
Will this thing take long?
It's a student magazine networked through Eastern Europe and funded by Republican do-gooders back in the States.
Alright!
Oh shit, yeah. Can you lend some more money?
It was the biggest I could find.
I didn't get to see what's on the disks but I can guess. Do you want to hear my terms or not.
First, I want to walk free with a letter, in English, from the Prosecutor General dropping all charges. Second, I want two first class tickets to London leaving tonight and three thousand crowns in a stamped envelope. Lastly, all actions against the students are to be stopped!
The choice is yours, it's not negotiable.
Working....Under cover.
Come on, don't me give a hard time. I'm just trying to make the place look nice for Katka.
Okay, Okay, but I want it right back. It belongs to my father.
Yeah.
Well, for a start, you've got to get cleaned up.
Why?
It's time to go home, Holly.
This press we cannot control. Americans, I think.
I don't understand it, there were a lot of people there last night, many Americans, I believe we should move carefully.
And what of these foreigners?
Why not?
You don't need a car you can't drive for a month. Go see Marvin.
Thanks.
That's eight years of school and training -- after college. And all that doesn't necessarily make you a better human being.
Landon. You have two parents. We're both here for you even --
Demented.
Scamming's a strong word.
-- Obviously.
You don't know me.
'Believe in yourself and they will. Let me ask you, Lizzie. Look in the mirror? Are you pretty --?'
-- This play means a lot to me.
Good thing.
Spend a year in the Peace Corps. Make a medical discovery --
I do know.  Be two places at once... learn to hit a baseball or turn a cartwheel... eat breakfast with chopsticks...
Don't bother!
He's a softy. Got him wrapped around my finger.
You think so.
That is my telescope.
Yeah.
But you think about Him -- It -- Her.
The Bible. Why should I read a bunch of dumb stories about some ancient guy who supposedly worked miracles.
Interpreted by another guy like my father.
I don't want to be just your friend --
What?
No.
The Challenger exploded. Principal Kelly's about to make an announcement.
I was twelve.
In my back yard.  I lied before. It's hardly started. But when it's done, it will have twice the power of this one --
Mars doesn't rise until 2:30
I don't want to come here anymore.
That's what I mean.
No. I want what's best for you.
So talk to us about something.
Either. Both.
How -- how long does she have?
In there.
For the focuser?
Jamie wanted that. She told me.
How would you do that, Mr. Carter?
-- You can and you will, Mr. Carter.
You're welcome.
Okay. Make me an isosceles.
What do you want, Biff?
What do you want, Biff?
Dick, what's with those guys out there in the gutter? 
Fine.
You do?
Coming, Eileen...
Saturday night's the 'Springtime in Paris' dance. I'm taking Suzy Parker.
Why is she gonna get angry with you?
No, George, just concentrate on the anger. Anger.
Unfortunately, the way things are going, you may get your wish. You may see the entire annhiliation of the world. If not, you'll certainly see the destruction of all out natural resources. We can already see the air we breathe, not to mention the pollution in our rivers and lakes. We'll  see all of our oil reserves depleted, in fact, all of our energy sources. Yes, you people have a lot to look forward to -- a lot to see.
Run out of gas?
What's this all about?
No, no, not beyond an acceptable level. Have you been X-rayed recently, Martin?
AM or PM?
You know me?
Yeah, a shopping mall. You know, a shopping mall?
We don't....
That's just what I needed to hear.
We're at one and a half miles, so you're just a little over a mile from where you want to be,  Wait until minus 3 minutes before you go -- that should give you plenty of time, and it should be close enough to zero hour that they can't do anything to stop you. Park the truck at 800 and get in the refri-- the time chamber. Just be sure the nose of the truck is pointed at the bomb....the power converter will do the rest.
87 states? Time travel bans? What the hell?
The Orpheum.
Yeah... Jesus! I wonder how he ever got up enough nerve to marry my mom.
Me neither. I've always wondered whether they slept together before they got married. You think yours did?
Hi, Marty!
Yeah, he said for you to give us a lift into town. You're the ones with the Studebaker, aren't you?
What's going on?
Running this place for a fella in town. Nothing much to speak of.
Well, I don't notice us hustling trash, either.
Kind of round, like so... Gold. I'll show you if you want.
You lost that one?
Wouldn't be here if I hadn't.
Well, I've got to read them first. Suppose I could get a Coke while I do?
I've got a gun here, sir. It's always a good idea to have one around.
You have to ask Kit. He says frog, I jump.
It's okay.
He'll say that?
Yeah.
Nothing.
I don't know.
Yeah?
Yeah.
Well, that's the point, stupid.
They're not going to listen to me. You either. Are you kidding?
I got him in the stomach.
He didn't say anything to me about it.
Well, I'm not going down there and look.
Positive?
How about over here?
No.
Yes?
Listen, ah... We're going to take the Cadillac for a while. How'd that be?
Just a second now. That's your truck. isn't it?
Git.
Hold it right there.
I could've held off an army if I could've gotten behind a rock in the mountains.
Nothing to apologize for, Casper.  You've gone beyond the call of duty tonight.  Mind if I get on the horn and radio the Cavaliers--?  They'll be worried.
They're stealing my chopper!
I'm assigning a couple Blue Shields to protect you around the clock, just in case.
So I was right.  That's nice to know...
Yeah, but most of 'em blasted in through the Eighth Dimension in 1938 at Grover's Mills, New Jersey...
Sam's dead!  Someone broke into the Jet Car! And things are going haywire over at the lab...
New Jersey brought her back to the bus through heavy fire.  Quite a guy if you want my opinion.
Don't look at me, Buckaroo Banzai.  I failed flight school.
Who?
The Netherlands.  Whew, that's a long way from Wyoming.
No, I don't.
I'll shoot yours off if I had a gun, you double-dealing Casanova!  I thought you liked me for myself.  But why should you, huh?  A jerk like me.
Oh, my.
Don't go to pieces.  I haven't got time tonight.
How did she die?  I wanna know.
I gotta go.  We're on borrowed time.
What?  If we just believe in Buckaroo Banzai?
Sure.  I won't hold my breath.
No, sir.  I think the flint...
Still no confirmation either from SAC or Strategic Space Command.  They report all surveillance satellite communication jammed.
Jammed--? By who? Whom by?
Hell they don't. I met my first wife that way.
Asshole probably got lost.
Bet you say that to all the girls, Perfect Tommy.
Really?...
What. What don't I understand?
Yes. Thank you. How's Bill?
Oh yeah? What kind of write?
So. You talked to Mundt, what about?
Just Bill, please.
What's that?
Ever act?
Well not much.
He's a great writer 
Well he's taken an interest!  That means he'll make your life hell, which I could care less about, but since I drew the short straw to supervise this turkey, he's gonna be all over me too! Fat-assed sonofabitch called me yesterday to ask how it's going  don't worry, I covered for you. Told him you were making progress and we were all very excited. I told him it was great, so now MY ass is on the line.  He wants you to tell him all about it tomorrow.
Who said write? Jesus, Jack can't read.  You gotta TELL it to him-tell him SOMEthing for Chrissake.
What do you do far a living?
Well, that's a good question. Strange as it may seem, Charlie, I guess I write about people like you. The average working stiff. The common man.
Yeah, I guess that's tragedy right there.
Hell no! Jesus, I'm the kind of guy, I'll let you know if I'm bored. I find it all pretty damned interesting. I'm the kind schmoe who's generally interested in the other guy's point of view.
Not at all. It's damned interesting.
Yeah...
Nope, never watched any. I'm not that interested in the act itself 
That's all right, really 
Not a bit of it, compadre! Easiest thing in the world! You just get down on your knees to my left, slap your right hand here...
Yeah, as a matter of fact they did. Come on in.
A little lift, yeah...
Where there's life there's hope.
You're leaving?
Well hell, buddy, don't pull a long face!  This is still home for me  I keep my room, and I'll be back sooner or later...
This kind of heat. It's pathetic.
Hold on. Stop. Take a deep breath. Tell me what happened.
Yeah.
Funny, huh, when everything that's important to a guy, everything he wants to keep from a lifetime  when he can fit it into a little box like that. I guess... I guess it's kind of pathetic.
That's okay, that's okay, that's okay  that's just fine. You probably just walked in here thinking that was going to be a handicap, thinking we wanted people who knew something about the medium, maybe even thinking there was all kind of technical mumbo- jumbo to learn. You were dead wrong. We're only interested in one thing: Can you tell a story, Bart?  Can you make us laugh, can you make us cry, can you make us wanna break out in joyous song? Is that more than one thing? Okay.  The point is, I run this dump and I don't know the technical mumbo-jumbo. Why do I run it? I've got horse-sense, goddamnit. Showmanship. And also, and I hope Lou told you this, I bigger and meaner than any other kike in this town. Did you tell him that, Lou? And I don't mean my dick's bigger than yours, it's not a sexual thing  although, you're the writer, you would know more about that. Coffee?
Ah, forget it, kid. I want you to pull this out of your head. If that sonofabitch wouldn't apologize to you, goddammit, I will. I respect your artistry and your methods, and if you can't fill us in yet, well hell, we should be kissing your feet for your fine efforts.
Uh-huh.
Ya see how he's not writing it down?
Okay, the hell with the story. Wallace Beery is a wrestler. I wanna know his hopes, his dreams. Naturally, he'll have to get mixed up with a bad element. And a romantic interest. You know the drill.  Romantic interest, or else a young kid. An orphan. What do you think, Lou? Wally a little too old for a romantic interest?  Look at me, a writer in the room and I'm askin' Lou what the goddamn story should be!
Mr. Lipnik, please 
No?
Yes.
Who's got access to my goddamn file?
I thought you hardly know her.
Tell me about Catherine.
You saw all the reports, Beth!
Put your hands up!
If that's the way you want to play it.
Only in theory.  You know all about homicidal impulse, don't you, shooter?  Not in theory -- in practice.
I thought it was a pretty good beginning.
I never have before.
Of course I knew.
You didn't not see me long enough to miss me.
I'm very good at research.  I'll help you.
A detective.  He falls for the wrong girl.
Somebody always does.
I told you.  She kills him.
No thank you.
Read me my rights and arrest me and I'll go downtown.
You make it up, but it has to be believable.  They call it suspension of disbelief.
Not now he don't.
She want to play?  Fine.  I can play.
Goddamn writers -- all they do is use up trees and ruin people's eyes.  There's gotta be somebody at Berkeley who knows what the hell happened.
Maybe she did, Gus.  Maybe she grew herself an Afro and learned a left hook and put shoe polish on her face.  Let's polygraph her again and ask her about it.
Formerly engaged to Roberto Vasquez, deceased --
She didn't ask me for the ride. She asked anybody.
How did they die?  Was there an investigation?
Don't fuck with me, Nick.  I don't need a reason to put your ass in a sling.
Fourteen.  We seal juvenile records until they're deceased.  That's why you didn't find it in your computer.
Can there be some mistake?
Why, so you could humiliate me?
No. It's one of the few times I feel good. I used to have to go to work and cook every day. That I got sick of.
Saddle River's in New Jersey.
New York.
I can give you five. You didn't do very much to these.
You don't even work on your stuff!
Let's go to the Carnegie Museum. They have the world's most famous sculptures all in these giant plaster replicas. It's really great. It's in Pittsburg.
What's wrong?
We can do better. It needed more white.
People are only interested in you because you're famous, not because they know a fuckin' thing about your work.
No.
I really think you should talk to him about this.
You name it, I paint there.
Sure.
Just look at him.  Little silver thingies on his cowboy boots? Honey, I don't think so.
Well, you said that.  You've got a lot of references from Leonardo da Vinci, don't you?
Yes, but as a black painter 
I see..  And... How do you respond to being called  hmmm...   yes, "the pickaninny of the art world."
Who said that?
No, he said I was the Eddie Murphy of the art world. He said the Eddie Murphy.
Really?
Get up. She won't buy anything if she sees me working on it!
SAMO.
Oh yeah..
About what?
I guess it was a long time ago.
I don't go there. Too many party girls.
A friend of mine offered me a job doing a little work installing a show in a gallery. He's an electrician. I was supposed to be there an hour ago.
You don't have any fucking money..
I've seen you before. I like your paintings a lot. Your hair was different.
I'd like to squeeze your titties.
No, I'd like the scarf.
I didn't know Tony Bennett painted.
What time is it?
I'm here for an interrogation. You've been called a graffiti artist and I wanna know why. All I see are scribble scrabble abstractions!
No, nothing, ah ...  His parents ... I ... I hope he finds them.
Alright, thanks.
Hanging on every word.
No darker than yours, Bruce.
Good time, too.  Everyone but the bandits seem to be slacking off till after New Years'.
Max, I'm gonna fight you on this. The Mayor and I have already spoken and we see eye to eye here.  So --
Batman.  The thorn in both our sides, the fly in our ointment.
... Want 'em to go apeshit.  Nutso. Ballistic ... Do permanent damage to little old ladies.  Loot, pillage, annoy people in a big way ...  <u>Sounds</u> fun.  But I ...
Okay, you have a point.  Plus, the hysterics are getting on my nerves.
Well I figured that your password was "Finster."  Your Pomeranian. And it was.  And it's all very interesting, though a bit on the technical side, I mean about how the power plant is a power plant in name only since in fact it's gonna be one big giant...
And who ... would you say this <u>to</u>?
That's my name, Maximillions. Don't wear it out, babe, or I'll make you buy me a new one.
Oh no, those things frighten me.
Women.
Their new computer sciences division.  How did you know?
You are going back to school.
My parents were killed in an auto accident ten years ago.  Alfred has been supporting me ever since.
Alfred's happy here.
I hate being lectured.
This is all about fashion for you, isn't it?
Bad, yes.  Guy, no.  This is one majorly beautiful evil person.
No.  Her case is too advanced.  But maybe, someday, with more research-
What are you talking about?
I guess we'll just have to kill her.
Maybe he melted.
That lab was consumed by fire last week.  how did you manage to escape?
People come first, Dr. Isley.
We've been going out over a year now and...Okay, here goes.  Bruce, I want to spend my life with you.
Presumed dead.  No one knows.
I'm late for the dedication.  Then I go after Freeze and Ivy.  Alone.
I knew you could handle it.
An enticing offer.  But what does the lady want in return?
You lie!
I'm hungry.  I think I'll have poultry.
To be frozen.  To never change.  A life of perpetual ice-olation. There is little perfection in that.
You're skating on thin ice.  My passion thaws for my bride alone.
Hop away little bunny.  Before I cool your jets.  Permanently.
Sorry to disappoint you.  But rubber lips are immune to your charms.
Hardly a worry, sir.
He ran away?
Dr. Meridian...
What? Oh, Edward. Hi. Congratulations. Great party-
La'chiem.
Rinka.
On occasion. Usually at night.
Me? No. Only things that need calming in my dreams are the Rockettes.
So what you're saying, this guy's a total wacko, right?
Exactly.
I'm sorry. Who are you?
Come on, Bruce. This is what I do for a living.
Touchy, touchy.
Oh God, Bruce. You're still jealous.
Stop fighting.
Excuse me.
Upstairs. He's quite docile.
What are you talking about?
I know. I called them.
It doesn't protect your head, though.
Well, Bruce, some types are a little more obvious than others.
I'll take you home if you'd like.
... We could try that.
I wish you'd...
What if I could save a handful? -- What if I could save one?
Why, Eckhardt.  You should be thinking about the future.
What are you, scared of heights?
Five stories, straight down. There was no blood in the body.
Do you want this money or don't you?  Now shut up!  Shut up --
Jack?  Thank God.  I can't believe it's you.  I heard you'd been --
And what happens if we say no?
Goddammit, I expect to be treated like and ARTIST. GET OFF MY SCREEN!!
Alicia!  Come here, have a seat.  Show Miss Vale why you wear the mask.
Yeah. Yeah. Little winded. DID YOU SEE THAT?!
What's wrong with you, David?  All you have to do is say, Excuse me, I've been sitting here since the start of the Millennium and I'd really like some action from you before the end of the world. I'll go.
I'm afraid you don't know the half of it. Sit down.  I have a tale to tell.  And not a happy one.
No, Annie, no.  This is Doctor Bean. He's going to be working with us.
oh dear.
Ahm.... .
Yes, isn't he.
Yes, look, I wanted to talk to you about this.  I'm sure we haven't been doing as badly as all that.
Great news.
Well, bravo!  What with you and Whistler's Ma - I think I've got a winning team.
And that's where you introduce me to the Governor.
You're not going to ....
Er ... pray tell me why?
And I need Fridays off, to spend more time with my family.  Speaking of which - if you'll excuse me .... I've got a lot of time to make up.
Richard Burton was very good-looking.
It's you and Mom that need to talk.
Sure.  You're right.
I'11 give you a chance... Know anything about computers?
off the peg?
It's a kind of an interesting swap. Mom for the Man from Ga Ga.
What's gone?
Uh,...Oh yeah.
Yeah, heh heh. Maybe it has a TV. Heh heh. TV.
Uh, huh huh... We'll do it, sir.
Huh huh huh.
Cool! Huh huh huh.
You mean there's mre than one?
Uh... I think you scared them off.
Uh, probably like, another five minutes or something.
Yer late.
I hope to score big there myself. I'm mostly going to be doing the slots.
We'll get you whatever you want.  Get that other kid. We might need him.
Chief, we found a witness that says he saw two teenagers leaving Dallas' room shortly before we arrived.
Did you give him a full cavity search?
Well, sir it's not good.  Roll the tape... The X-5 unit is a new top-secret biological weapon, a manmade virus...
It gets worse. The unit wasn't finished. It has a flaw - the casing. If hit hard enough, it could break open, releasing the virus.
Where did these guys come from?
D.C., Chief.
Chief, I swear, we tore that bus apart. They couldn't have...
Agent Hurley...
Uh, Butt-Head.
She sure does.
Uh, huh huh. Is that gonna be enough time?
Uh, ten uh...
Ten grand? That cheap-ass... I got a better deal for ya. I'll double it. I'll pay ya twenty if you go back there and do mah husband.
You're doing it, Adam.  You're saving this town.
I'll tell you what, Barbara.  I don't think we survived that crash.
That's how long you were gone.
Yes it did.  Yes it did.  I made a couple of small discoveries. Here's one.
Maybe this is heaven.
Hon... I didn't want to die, but really, this is fine with me.  As long as I never have to wash dishes again.
I don't know.  <u>Jane, Jane, up here</u>!
<u>You</u> left me.
Adam, you had a photo of Big Foot!
... Yes this must be him.  Look... Betelgeuse... Betelgeuse...
But <u>we</u> let him out.
I didn't --
3:30 I guess.
Really.  I don't know.
Now, let's get rolling!
We need help.  We deserve help.
Pity.  Murderers seem to have an easy time of it.  Just look at Amityville.  He was one of my boys.  Didn't have to give that one any lessons. From day one... But I must be off ... I've got a planeload of football players crashed in the midwest... they need a lot of help, just with the basics.
No!  Jane, it is 6:45 in the morning!
'Bye, Jane, I'll see you in church in a couple weeks.
Of course they're dead.  They're ghosts.
No, I mean they've gone. Decamped.  Split.  Vanished.
Good girrrl!
How'd you like to have the biggest boobs in the world?  Right now.  I can do it if I get out.
There's only one Chinese restaurant in town, darling, the owners are Irish and Irish people happen to cook Cantonese.  They don't know better.
Delia hates it.
Well I just wanted to tell you what I saw.
... sheets.
They're ghosts.  They do what they want.
Listen, you guys.  These ghosts are really nice people.  I think we scared them off.  Let's just leave them alone.  Okay?
Otho, could you actually... do something with them?
No listen... we'll talk about this visiting later, I gotta go, I gotta meeting on the Japanese joint venture.
This is our first meal in this house, Lydia.  Why don't we all do our little private parts to make it a pleasant one?
Tried to convince me that this house is haunted.  Kids.  Kids. Kids!  I love them.
No time like the present, as my wicked stepmother used to say.
Be brave!  Otho take care!  Onward!
I have a feeling there's some very interesting space behind this door.
Remind me to talk to your mother about the dress code.  I'm sure you're going to be very happy there.
It's okay.  How's the dirt business?
I understand. I've seen it done before.
But not for long...
Oh, fine.
Just to take the proper precautions, Mr. Gardiner, I'd recommend we take you downstairs and X-ray your leg.  ... By the way, Mr. Gardiner, I would like to ask you something straight out.
... Straight out?
Claim...? ... Oh, claim, that's what Thomas asked me.
Oh, I see...  ... Well, then... You're a very funny man, Mr. Gardiner. You caught me off guard, I must admit...
Thank you.
Good, keep your weight off that leg, Mr. Gardiner. In fact, it would be best if you could stay here for a day or two, if that would be would be possible. Since Benjamin became ill we have our own hospital downstairs. I can promise you the finest in care, unless, of course, you would prefer to go elsewhere.
Yes, Robert. I know about the President.
... Oh? You've heard?
Hell yes - walk. You're meeting the President, aren't you?
To everyone, I'm afraid. The Government controls are so restricting that the Medical Profession, as we know it, is being legislated out of existence.
In a minute, Robert - in a minute... Chauncey, I would like to ask a favor of you...
At times, yes. But that's not an uncommon reaction to such an accident. Actually, I found him to have quite a sense of humor.
Chauncey is so sensitive... He was overcome with grief...
Another thing that baffles me, Doctor - what was his connection with the deceased? Major financial dealings, obviously - but our firm has no record of any such transactions.
Yes, sir.
Well, I still don't believe I know the man, Mr. Gardiner. Now, hold still.
Thank you.
I see.  ... Say, would you mind seeing our family doctor?
Oh, I see... Your mentor, perhaps?
Yes, Eve. You'll be all right.
How is Ben feeling?
He's tired, Chauncey - but he's going to watch you tonight. We'll both be watching.
No, Eve. I don't read the papers.
Yes. It's very good, Eve.
Good, sir. And so, it seems, did the President - but we would like to have some facts; such as, uh... What exactly is the relationship between yourself and that of the First American Financial Corporation?
Yes, that is correct. I think you should ask Mr. Rand that.
Hello, Morton.
Do you realize, Mr. Gardiner, that more people will be watching you tonight than all those who have seen theater plays in the last forty years?
Yes, very well, thank you.
And yours, sir - Chauncey Gardiner!  How poetic! Chauncey, a name of uncertain meaning! And Gardiner, a bit of the French, a suggestion of a stroll through the flowers! A beautiful name, my friend!
We must speak again, Mr. Gardiner, many times!
Yes. I like that very much.
No, Ben.
Oh, sure you do, the financial assistance program. I think you might be just the man to take charge of such an undertaking. I'd like you to meet with the members of the Board, we'll be able to discuss the matter at greater length at that time.
Senator Rowley's widow, Sophie, is hosting an evening reception tomorrow evening honoring Ambassador Skrapinov of the Soviet Union... I think it's rather obvious that Robert won't allow me to attend, so - would you go in my place, and escort Eve?
Good. Together, the two of you should create quite a stir - I can already hear the gossip.
... Sir?
Yes, I would like to see Ben.
Your appearance doesn't suggest that at all, Mr. Chance.
Yes. Of men and women.
It's very sore.
Yes sir. I'll take care of that.
Is his back feeling better?
... I see.
... Yes, Louise, it's snowing in the garden today. Have you looked outside and seen the snow? It's very white.
Yes. Louise will bring me lunch.
You live here?  ... We don't have any record of that.
I would like to stay and work in my garden.
No, it's been a good day - better than yours, from what I've been told.
I may be a shut-in, but I do not lack for news. I'm sorry you had to go through all that.
... Yes, I am, Ben.
I shall take the gentleman to the third floor guest suite, ma'am. Dr. Allenby is standing by.
Oh, I've been just dying to meet you, Mr. Gardiner!
... Would you take me on a tour?
We have nothing on him, Ambassador Skrapinov.
And put it through on a Code Red - I want it as soon as possible.
I do not want Benjamin Rand disturbed! You have other ways of gathering information than to trouble a dying man. Use whatever agencies are necessary to put together a detailed history of Chauncey Gardiner, if you run into problems, alert Honeycutt.  I'll be in the office at seven in the morning and I would like to have it at that time.  I've got to take a leak.
Well, we do have data from Honeycutt's sources, Chief - but it isn't pertinent.
Good. Anything else?
That could be possible...
That is correct, Comrade Skrapinov. We have ascertained that Gardiner heads a big-business power group that will soon be taking over the American government.
You have proven that already, Comrade Skrapinov, you are to be congratulated for recognizing the importance of this man and establishing an early friendship.
Nonsense, Mr. President - I thank you for coming to spend time with a dying man.
Mr. Gardiner...
I'm a puppeteer.
Seven-ish
She's very beautiful.
Hi.
Tom-Tom's puncture wound is infected.
What?
I was, wasn't I?  I was John fucking Malkovich!  Take me back, Craig.
Us, of course.
We?
Life is confusing, isn't it?
It'll never happen, fuckface.
I'm in love. For the first time. It's funny, but when it happens to you, there's no question.
It's okay, Craig. It all worked out, in an odd sort of way.
You came up here looking for the portal?
And yourself too in the process. God, you're so beautiful. Why couldn't I see that before?
You'll have me, after all I've done to you?
I know.
I can't believe it. This is too good to be true.
I know. I'm sorry...
Schwartz.
Schwartz.
Thank you, sir.
No thank you sir. It's delicious, though. I just wanted to thank you for the opportunity to work at LesterCorp, but I'm afraid I'm going to have to tender my resignation effectively immediately.
I am not alone. There are others. We are legion. You will pay for this blasphemy. You will pay dearly.
Well, truth is for suckers, isn't it?.
Listen. I'm Craig Schwartz, just starting out at LesterCorp.
How dreary - to be - Somebody / How public - like a Frog / To tell one's name - the livelong June / To an admiring Bog!
Emily Dickinson.
You know, if you ever got me, you wouldn't have a clue what to do with me. That's the thing, Romeo.
I'm right?
Puppets. Maxine. It's the idea of being inside someone else, feeling what they feel, seeing what they see...
It better be.
Exactly. Two hundred dollars a pop.
Sounds good. Oblique but intriguing. Phone it in.
Can I be anyone I want?
The Great Mantini?
No, the Mediocre Mantini. Of course the Great Mantini!
Can you do that? I mean, do you know anything about puppetry?
Someone names A Lot of Warts on line two.
Do you?
I don't know anything about her. What if she's some sort of witch or something?
All the better. Hey, Hot Lesbian Witches, next Geraldo, buddy boy. Ha ha ha.
Dr. Lester, would you point me toward the restroom?
We need you on the inside, my child. To report on his comings and goings, and if need be, to... destroy him...  ...for lack of a better word.
When?
I thought so too, doll. I guess we were mistaken.
Yeah, I saw them
Who needs dancing?
No, I guess not. I'm an actor.
Oh, Lotte...
No! Please!  Shut up, will you? We're trying to think here.  It is sort of like being a puppeteer. I like that about it.
What want ye, girl child?
That's the last thing they took from me.
What I have to do is get in my bed and lay down. I want to fix on something harmless in this world.
I'm saying they came into my yard.
Not like He punished me.
You still know.
No. I'm looking for what I was put here to look for: the back door.
YES. I WAS ON THE OTHER SIDE.
YES.
Mama told you - I'd give up my own life, every minute, every hour of it to take back one of your tears baby...My children my best thing. You my best thing!
You think I should stop by? Think she'd welcome it?
Yes?
Haven't seen her since that day. Ella thinks she might be waiting in the woods for another chance but..I don't think so. Mama thinks she's gone for good. Says she can feel it.
You think she sure 'nough your sister?
Yes sir
I'm looking for work. I was thinking they might know of some.
I never went to those woodland services but she was always nice to me. Always. Never be another like her.
Oh yeah. They good. Can't say they ain't good. I wouldn't trade them for another pair, tell you that. But you come back in a few days - give me a chance to lead'em to it. All right?
Work? Start learnin your letters again?
Food. My mama, she doesn't feel well. I couldn't stay away from her too long, cause of her condition but I could do chores in the mornings.
Oh baby...I don't know anyone could pay anybody anything for work they did themselves...But if you all need to eat until your mother's well, all you have to do is say so...We have a church committee invented so nobody had to go hungry.
I'll make sure she does. But first I'm going  make up a nice, big breakfast against that cold outside.
Oh I been out.
Was over to Baby Suggs.
You sure?
Hold on! Don't jump if you can't see bottom!
Aw, no, Ella.
Anything white floating around in the woods - if it don't got a shotgun, it's something the Lord tells me I don't want no part of.
Ella.
You?
And he left when he found out what Sethe did?  What you say casts a different light on it, I guess...I thought-
You know as well as I do, Stamp, that people who die bad don't stay in the ground.
Yeah. Look bad?
Oh, I don't have no plans. No plans at all.
Aw, girl. Don't cry...Me and you, we got more yesterday than anybody. We need some kind of tomorrow...
Don't talk to me, Mr. Sawyer. Don't say nothing to me this morning.
Yeah. Too sweet. 
Yeah, yeah I know. Okay.
Just, uh, just slip the rent under my door.
Huh.
Shit.
Her life is in your hands, Dude. And report back to us as soon as it's done.
I want a fucking lawyer, man.  I want Bill Kunstler.
She's not my special lady, she's my fucking lady friend.  I'm just helping her conceive, man!
I FUCK YOU!  I FUCK YOU!
Rug-peers did not do this.  I mean look at it.  Young trophy wife. Marries a guy for money but figures he isn't giving her enough.  She owes money all over town--
What's that, Walter?
You gotta buck up, man, you can't go into the tournament with this negative attitude--
I've had a--
Yes, uh, very impressive.
That's a Los Angeles Chamber of Commerce Business Achiever award, which is given--not necessarily given every year!  Given only when there's a worthy, somebody especially--
Different mothers, huh?
No, they--
--smoking thai-stick, breaking into the ROTC--
Yes, heh--
I'm unemployed.
Separate incidents?
Well I like your style too, man. Got a whole cowboy thing goin'.
Yeah, well, right man, there are many facets to this, uh, you know, many interested parties.  If I can find your money, man-- what's in it for the Dude?
Does the Pope shit in the woods?
Oh yeah?
Yes, they don't like hearing it and find it difficult to say.  Whereas without batting an eye a man will refer to his "dick" or his "rod" or his "Johnson".
Sex.  The physical act of love. Coitus.  Do you like it?
I like it too.  It's a male myth about feminists that we hate sex. It can be a natural, zesty enterprise. But unfortunately there are some people--it is called satyriasis in men, nymphomania in women--who engage in it compulsively and without joy.
Now I got--
Her "co-star" in the beaver picture?
Do you still have that doctor's number?
Well, uh. . . Not much to tell.
Uh-huh.
What do you do for fun?
No no, the wealth was all Mother's.
We did let Father run one of the companies, briefly, but he didn't do very well at it.
Yeah man, it really tied the room together--
Jeff Lebowski.  Come on.  This other Jeffrey Lebowski.  The millionaire. He's gonna be easier to find anyway than these two, uh. these two  . . . And he has the wealth, uh, the resources obviously, and there is no reason, no FUCKING reason, why his wife should go out and owe money and they pee on your rug.  Am I wrong?
You brought a fucking Pomeranian bowling?
Am I wrong!
You're not wrong, Walter, you're just an asshole.
When he moved down to Venice he had to go door-to-door to tell everyone he's a pederast.
Walter, face it, there isn't any connection.  It's your roll.
My dirty undies.  Laundry, Dude. The whites.
Agh--
Walter--what the fuck are you thinking?
They hung up, Walter!  You fucked it up!  You fucked it up!  Her life was in our hands!
Dude, nothing is fucked.  Come on. You're being very unDude.  They'll call back.  Look, she kidnapped her--
The bridge is coming up!  Gimme the ringer, Dude!  Chop-chop!
Walter, please--
How the fuck should I know?  I do know that nothing about it indicates--
Dude--
--We're sympathizing here, Dude--
Yeah yeah, I know the fucking show Walter, so what?
Uh-huh.
It is a fucking emergency.
I'm saying if he knows I'm a fuck- up, then why does he still leave me in charge of getting back his wife? Because he fucking doesn't want her back, man!  He's had enough!  He no longer digs her!  It's all a show! But then, why didn't he give a shit about his million bucks?  I mean, he knew we didn't hand off his briefcase, but he never asked for it back.
What's your point, Dude?
It's just part of your whole sick Cynthia thing.  Taking care of her fucking dog.  Going to her fucking synagogue.  You're living in the fucking past.
Dude!  Dude, I'm sorry!
Dude, I'm--it was an accident!
Dude, I'm sorry--
Okay, listen--
You are approaching a vooden britch. When you cross it you srow ze bag from ze left vindow of ze moving kar.  Do not slow down.  Vee vatch you.
So you know they were trying to piss on your rug--
Hello!  Hello!  So every time--I just want to understand this, sir-- every time a rug is micturated upon in this fair city, I have to compensate the--
You're just looking for a handout like every other--are you employed, Mr. Lebowski?
Employed?
Huh?
Well we--I don't--
All right, get out.  Both of you.
You're bullies!  Cowards, both of you!
This is not Nam.  This is bowling. There are rules.
All right!  There it is!  It's fucking zero!
Someday.
Fry 'em.
Because one of us is going to kill the other before this ends.
I don't understand.
I want to see the sun rise.
Took you long enough.
I'll show you.
Look, I care about the humans who are dying, not you, got it?
Human?
Nomak?
You're wasting your time, Blade.  The flechette's a dud.
Two things.  One, I was on to you the moment they turned you.  And two --  I switched that dud of yours back with the real one.
Ain't no thing but a chicken wing, buttercup.
Nomak said something to Blade in Greek. Athelfiki singenia ex amato.  Where did he learn that?
The pimp-mobile?  Just made a few after market modifications.  Nitrous-oxide injection system, forged aluminum pistons and crankshaft, higher flowing fuel pump.
Fuck yeah.  Whole package'll crank this betty up another three-hundred horsepower.
And you'll burn the damn thing out before your next fucking oil change.
Look, kid, they obviously found your base of operations.  If it was a trap, why flip their dicks by announcing themselves?
You're wasting your time, already been tried.
Going on twenty years now.
Back when Blade had me hunting down your puckered old ass.  What's up with your hair, anyway?  Fucking Willie Nelson look-a-like?
Just do it, old man.
I dabble in pharmaceuticals, medical research. We've developed a type of sun-blocker using octyl salicylate, a few others things.
Maybe I don't see it that way.
You're wrong.
The vampire God. This speaks of His return.
"The Blood Tide".
I'm sorry, I --
I don't care what you believe. I saved your life once, I don't plan on making a habit of it. You want my advice, you'll be out of the city by nightfall. If you're stupid enough to stay, that's your business.
And that's a good thing?
It's war, now get the fuck out of the way!
There is no cure.
What do you see here?
How can you tell?
The way they move, they way they smell --
Your mother sounds like a Hallmark greeting card.
I'm just tired, that's all. We've been up all night.
I'm not leaving without you.
You don't understand. The Thirst --
I know. Take some of my blood.
Maybe it's time to start exploring other alternatives.
There's only one alternative to the serum.
Fight him --
I don't know --  Look at this blood smear --
What?
Jesus, Karen, you're breaking my heart here --
Someone who's sick of living off scraps. The coming age belongs to us, not the humans!  When the final war between our races comes, who do you want leading the charge?
You've been bitten by a vampire. We've got to try and burn out the venom, just like a rattlesnake bite --
Habit, mostly, just like this.
He killed them?
Then vampirism is a genetic defect, just like Hemolytic anemia?
With a retrovirus. It's injected into the bone marrow cells, it causes the host's DNA to mutate. They've been using them to treat Sickle-cell anemia.
Join the club.
What happened to her, where did she go?
Closer. Lift the lid and look-- it hurts.
--my God, Nick???
--it's called "morning sickness," asshole--
Domini. Domini Von Teer.
Why is there no "our" here?
Could we take this up later--like indoors, without half the world listening?
I don't know.
--scared the living shit out of us.
We're leaving--case dismissed for lack of evidence. Maybe on the ride home we can figure how the fuck we're going to graduate with no thesis.
I get dreams. I don't like 'em.
--no, you're not. You love me too much. You don't want to see them kill me.
Beta Cam's still coming back tomorrow, right?
--no, I think they're all in there.
--hunch. Just sort've saw 'em there.
I don't know yet.
What? That made her lose the baby?
Fine.
Like hell. Play the goddamn tape.
Just let me get my coat off--I had eight cups of coffee, I'm wired for sound here.
Shut-up.
Too busy eating us?
Heather, does that look like Domini there?
The cart they brought Elly Kedward into the woods with--
--Domini!
--hell, I don't think I'm ever leaving this place again--
--one of us, all of us--I have no idea--brought whatever this thing is back here. We're not going to go out there and spread it around like Typhoid Mary. We're gonna figure it out, we're gonna bring a goddamn <u>end</u> to it.
I'm not finished.
Look, guys, we're cold, we're tired we're <u>shook</u>--we just want to get out of here as soon as there's light. We saw something up at Coffin Rock today--
First enormous brick warehouse on your right.
A Cyber Entrepreneurialship.
No one's been in or out since you left. Would've heard the dogs.
I think it's time to get out of here.
Ah, Domini?
You planning on sleeping out there?
Motion. Stop there. Play it again.
Two-to-one he dusts the keyboard for fingerprints the second he gets back.
What'd you say?
What?
That they'll start touching us inside our heads.
--she wasn't a witch--we embrace nature, not evil--
--I know!
I dunno it's anything. It's a name Anna's mentioned--from her dreams.
Or a blood blister--or a bruise.
There are <u>other</u> explanations! She is not the goddamn witch, that's insane!
--the Sheriff's Office--
I... I'm sorry, Meurice. I gotta talk to you... Can I come in?
No, I--
You don't look too good. You sleep last night?
...Well, I'd be okay in here--
I couldn't believe it either...
...You ever get tired?
Ray?... What time is it?
I don't know. I better get off now.
What the hell happened, Ray?
Isn't that what you want?
I think someone's watching.
You've got a very sophisticated palate.
You won't have to. I just wanted to see if you knew.
I'm not surprised, the company you've been keeping the last ten years.
...Figured I'd better leave before I used it on him. I don't know how you can stand him.
I'll figure something out... How come you offered to drive me in this mess?
Yeah.
I mean, I ain't a marriage counselor--
What're you, a fucking marriage counselor?
What do you mean...
The money. Yeah. That's a right smart of money...
I want you to go fishing.
I must've gone money simple. This kind of murder...
Red Label.
Right.
Wasn't too busy. You missed a good one, though. This white guy walks in about one o'clock, asks if we have a discount for alcoholics... I tell him to get lost, but Marty's sitting here listening and I can tell he's thinking that maybe it ain't such a bad idea...
Aunt Barbara. I love you, but you're not gonna get it.
Got it. Thanks for letting me in on as much as you did.
Excuse me, Mrs. Williams.
I understand. I'm just real curious like you said.
I guess you've seen some bad things.
Yes I have - so bad I wouldn't poison your mind by telling you.
It's blue. blue velvet.
Well now Jeffrey, how did you come to get so involved?
Does Dorothy know her husband is dead?
Yeah. but get outta here. He's comin' back.
Oh he forced you, huh?
Oh God, that stuff stinks.
Nope. it's new stuff. no smell.
Jeffrey. Jeffrey what?
I sprayed your apartment. I took your key. I really didn't mean to do anything but see you.
Look. I'm sorry. Just let me leave.
No way.
I'll go then.
It's okay. It's okay.
Maybe you don't know. I know you though. You're Jeffrey Beaumont and I know where you live and I know ways to get you and I know ways to kill you.
I can't. I can't. You think you know so much.
Whatiya mean?
No. I told you. I don't want to hurt you. I want to help you. I think I know some of what is happening to you.  . Dorothy? Frank has your husband and son. Dorothy? Doesn't he? You have to do something Dorothy. go to the police.
There's so much I want to tell you. I'm in so much darkness though with things moving. there is darkness sucking me. It's kissing me and darkness is entering me. in every hole. It's opening me to a death.
Why are you here?  Hmmmmmmmm!!!! Ok.
I want you to stay with me.
Okay. soon? Do you think I'm too fat?
You look beautiful to me.
Yeah. I guess I did.  What's going to happen to me?
Let's take our neighbor out. Let him fuckin' walk back. 
You were pretty popular. Didn't you run for some office?
What else is new?. right?
Yeah. It's close by. that's what's creepy. They've had her under surveillance for a couple of months, except I don't know what they've found out because my father isn't in charge of her.
First of all, we're going to the Slow Club to see Dorothy Vallens. We'll watch her for awhile. I'd like to hear her sing anyway, and then also we'll know she is there and not in her apartment.
He got a little jealous.
That doesn't bother you, does it?
I will.  I'll pick you up on the same corner at three thirty-five, okay?
See ya tomorrow.
Jeffrey!!
Really. you want to dance with someone else?
Hey Jeff.
Hey Jeff. I'm feelin' so much better.
Sure. just a sec.  Excuse me.
My pleasure, Augusto.  Diego has told me much about you.
What?
Five-thousand per kilo.
Ha ha.  That's too much, Georgie.  Those days are over.  The rate is one-thousand dollars.  Inflation, you know?
What is?
I know it's not the greatest.  It's commercial.
Excuse me?
So you do have an agreement with the United States Government, Mr. Jung, correct?
Whose cloths?  Your clothes?
No.
I guess not.  Okay.  You know, you're very lucky you're friends of Barbie's. If you weren't, I'd never talk to you.
It's your grass.
It's in the past.  I'm out of the business now, so forget about it.  No hard feelings.  We need to move on.  And besides, I'm sorry, too.
No fucking way.
Your offense?  Why are you here?
Me, too.  Too much blah, blah, blah, blah is no good.  But we are roommates, okay?  And we must talk to each other. I am arrested for stealing cars.  For the grand theft auto.  Okay?  So, now it is your turn.  Now you will tell me, okay?  You will tell me why you are here?
What's the other one?
You failed because you had the wrong dream.
And that's wholesale.  Cut it a few times and retail, you're looking at two, three-hundred thousand.
Four passenger, single engine Cessna.
Perfect, George.  Perfect.  Everything is fine down here.  Everything is all set up.
Yes.  Look around you.  The sun.  The water.  The women.  It's better than Danbury, no?  Come on.  I have some friends I would like you to meet.
And what happens when these guys stop paying?  Sooner or later, these guys are going to cut us out.  Then where are we?
That's my George, always thinking.
Then relax.  It's a federal bank. Guaranteed by the government.  And Senor Noriega has very lenient banking principles.  No questions.  No problems. All the pesados keep their money here. Even El Padrino.  What do you worry? Everyone knows we are with Escobar.  Who is going to fuck with us?
I'm driving you crazy?  No.  You're driving me crazy.  We had a dream.  What happened to our dream?
Que es lo que quieren de me, hijueputas campesinos?
Es un Ford blanco junto a una pick-up.
Derek Foreal.  Derek Foreal.  Derek fucking Foreal.  Alright?  The answer to all your dreams.  Are you happy now?
Cocaine?  How much?
Mexico.
Who's the cheapskate?
Actually, it was three.
But, never mind.  I am thinking we can do much together.  This problem with Diego, the stolen car, the jail, is very silly business.  To release him from the carcel, it causes me much inconvenience. The fifty kilos could have been a big problem.  And I don't like problems.
People tell me that I am crazy.  That my business will never work in your country.  What do you think, George?
Keep them coming?  Ah, yes.  Ha ha.  You are right.  But money.
It is very difficult.  Diego makes me a lot of money.  If Diego goes so does the money.  You were an excellent teacher, George.  When the student has learned well, the teacher is no longer necessary.  We must remember we have wives, friends, familia.  Even familia that has not been born.  But sometimes, we must forget as well.  I am like you. I must teach the lesson.  We want to teach the lesson.  But we cannot.  We must remember that life is the teacher.
Holy shit, Dulli.  What the hell are you doing here?
I don't know.  My name is George.
I know who you are, El Americano. Mister George.
Fuck you, George.  I knew you'd say something like that.  Always thinking about yourself.
Yeah, so I've been thinking.  I love her, y'know?  I kind of want to have her.  I've been away for so long.  Make up for the missed time, you know?
Is she here?  George, Kristina hates you.  You fucked her over one too many times.  And I'm not here to socialize. Did you hear about Diego?
He wants me to testify?  Is that what he's asking me to do?
What's happening to us?
What do you want from me?
You mean, like a trip?
What is it?  A Disneyland thing?
I swear on your life.
I love you.  I love you so much.  You've got to know that.  You've got to know.
Not today, George.  Time to go back.
Who's the co-pilot?
What if I brought you, let's say, fifty thousand dollars?  Would that eliminate some of your concerns?
Stoned?
Relax.  I've flown with my old man a million times.  And he always told me, the taking off part is easy, it's the landing you've got to worry about.
Don't be such a pussy.
Dien Bien Phu?
Exactly.
Sail.
Second district ...
Third group. What's your assignment?
I don't do that kind of thing.
No. Not you, or any one of us. As long as we are free, the NLF continues to exist in the Casbah. If they manage to take us too, there won't be anything left ... And from nothing comes nothing ...
Sure ...
It's a question of habit ...
No, they'll do even more. We've given them the opportunity to do a lot more ... Do you understand what I mean? Starting tomorrow, they won't be groping in the dark any more; every shop and every worker who strikes will be a known enemy, a self-confessed criminal ... And they will be able to pass to the offensive. Have you thought of this?
Why?
Yes ... But let me first see you.
Fine, Charlie.  You familiar with the Marsh case?
You got something on the coke?
Right now.  Guess who's been buying Coke from him for the last five and half years?
Thanks, Mister D.
Because he wasn't dead when she left, and even if he was, not reporting a natural death in a timely fashion isn't a crime.
Yes.
No.
Then how did it get into his body?
Your Honor, the State enters this evidence as exhibit A.  Were any fingerprints found on the bottle?
What was the nature of the argument?
Alright -- I'm going to allow his testimony.
You may call your next witness.
Marsh left her close to three million dollars in his will.  That's motive. She admits to being there the night of his death.  That's opportunity -- and her fingerprints are on the nasal spray bottle.
Then she's not as smart as I thought she was.  You've seen her in the depositions.  Tell me you don't have any doubts?
You've been following me?
Did you ever see Mr. Marsh use Cocaine?
Yes.
How would you describe your sex life with Miss Lawson?
How did your relationship with Miss Lawson progress after the surgery?
It didn't.
If you knew it was bad for you why did you do it?
You're still angry, aren't you? Isn't it true that your whole story is nothing more than a vindictive attempt on your behalf to get back at Miss Lawson?
That's all Dr. Paley.
No.
Why does she come to you?
A previous witness stated that she saw Miss Lawson pouring a white powder into her hand on October twenty-eighth.  According to your records when did you prescribe the drug?
One last question, Doctor.  If someone didn't know better, would it be easy to mistake the peony root for cocaine?
Where did you meet him?
I'm a nurse.  I used to work at Roseburg Memorial Hospital.  Dr. Paley's on staff there.
He laughed -- and basically said he would decide when it was over.
I take it you don't like Miss Lawson very much?
Didn't Mr. Marsh also tell you that Miss Lawson felt bored here and was thinking about going back to Chicago for awhile?
Yes.  I suppose it's possible.
That bastard!
Yes.
Dristan nasal spray.
I don't know.
No!  Why would I want to kill him?
You killed him -- didn't you, Joanne?
What do you think I've got?  A gun? Maybe I'm gonna kill you too.  Maybe I'll blow your head off right now.
Not a very good one I'm afraid.
No pain, no gain?
Because -- it's beyond intellect. It's emotion.  It's passion.  It has to be experienced -- it can't be imagined.
Because, I'm your attorney.  I shouldn't be going to your house.
Is it against the law?
It's okay.
It won't be that hard.
What?
No, I don't have to believe you.  The jury has to believe you and answers like he's lying or she's mistaken aren't going to convince them.
I don't use cocaine anymore.  If she says she saw me doing it she's lying.
Why would she lie?
Of course.
Don't worry about Paley.  He can't touch me.  No one can.  I've thought it all out.
Honey.
That's crazy.
Don't listen to him.  Can't you see he's trying to turn you against me.
I'm supposed to be on vacation.
No, Your Honor.
I can back it up.
I am relaxing.
What's she like?
I'll talk to him later.
Why don't you talk to him now?
Please -- not now.
Not even if they're a dork.  You should go by and see how he's feeling.
Michael doesn't understand. People who make the kind of money my brother makes don't carry money on them. They keep it all in various accounts.
Doesn't matter. Move on.
I know. I don't understand it either.
Well, there's a problem.
Come here a minute.
What?
Don't talk to me like that. She was my mother for Christsakes. And now I find out she was... She was a --!
"... It's all there in the three notebooks. Read them in order. If you don't want to, I suppose that's okay too. But in that case I want you to know something -- I never stopped loving your father. He was a very good man. It's just that my love for Robert was different. He brought out something in me no one had ever brought out before, or since. He made me feel like a woman in a way few women, maybe more, ever experience..."
Have you called Betty?  Maybe you should.
Yeah. But I thought she died.
Not yet. You want to go?
I never knew that.
What about me! I feel really weird. Like she cheated on me, not dad. Isn't that sick? I don't mean I wanted to sleep with her or anything but -- ya know -- being the only son. You're sort of made to feel like you're the prince of the kingdom, ya know? And in the back of your mind, you kind of think your mother doesn't need sex anymore because she has you.
Hi. I made some brown betty. I sent Floyd off to town with the boy. I said -  "Floyd, I'm going to visit my girlfriend and spend the afternoon and that's all there is to it. He said who's going to make lunch? I said I'm taking a sick day. Eat at the dinner." Isn't that hilarious?  He didn't dare raise an eyebrow -- I don't even want to tell you how late he was out last night with those good for nothings from the Sandford ranch. I am so sorry, honey, I let two days pass before I came by, but with the boy home the time just escapes me. Have you heard from Richard? How's the fair? God, it's hot.
You want me to call the doctor?
Hmm-mmm.
Well, from Italy to Iowa -- that's a story!  Whereabouts in Italy?
Want another cigarette?
What's he like?
I feel so embarrassed.
Sure. Men cook. We don't all eat bananas with our feet, ya know.
We got engaged.
I'm kind of obsessed by it, actually.
No. I wouldn't say that. National Geographic isn't exactly the hub of artistic inspiration. They like their wild life in focus and without any personal comment. I don't mind really. I'm not artist. I'd faced that a long time ago. It's the course of being well-adjusted. I'm too normal.
This is your home. It's not nowhere. And it's not dull.
You drink bug repellent?
No. I'll do them later.
Francesca?
I never got lost. For some reason, I'm more at home everywhere than at one place. So I decided I'll think of myself as some kind of world citizen. I belong everywhere and nowhere. I'm kin to everyone, and no one in particular. See, once you get into the habit of not needing anyone, it's kind of hard to break.
I embrace Mystery. I don't know what's coming. And I don't mind.
Do you want to leave your husband?
Oh, sure. Great.
No. I'll drive myself. I have a few errands. I'll meet you there.
Oh. I guess you got the whole story.
Would you like a beer for your bath?
Are you hungry?
Why?
I sat outside and had coffee.
No, I don't mind.
Across the street. She went into the park and got turned around and didn't know her way out.
Well, I just want to know the procedure. I don't want to upset your routine. Do you want any jam?
For who?
For anyone. They'll never be able to live through the talk. Richard will never be able to. He doesn't deserve that. He hasn't hurt anyone in his life.
No, they don't say much. But Carolyn's 16. She's just about to find out about all this for herself -- she's going to fall in love, she's going to try and figure out how to build a life with someone. If I leave what does that say to her?
TO HELL WITH YOU!
Sure.
Well, she's... she's real pretty and ... and she's got a cute shape... she's a good sport, ya know, for laughs and  ... she loves fried chicken wings and beer.
Well, that's crazy. I don't know anybody who gets cremated.
I don't.
He yours, sir?
Take my advice.  And shoot that dog.  Or let me.
Yeah?
Take my advice.  Get the hell out of there.  It's a bad place.  Always has been.
Keep smokin', fool.
Pat's right.  It'll be fun.
But things change.  You gotta think ahead.
I don't know whether to chill you and serve with cottage cheese, or rip you open and eat you right here.
What?
Nothing but net?  Could be a swish.  Or a muthafucking air ball.
I have to finish this for class.
Maybe once upon a time.  But that was long ago.  Back before... before it became what it is.
Who was he, Momma?  He tried to kill us.
How do you know?
Anytime.  Be seeing you.
Yeah.  But when something bad happens, something really bad -- the wall breaks. The fabric tears.
I saw your face.  You knew that place. You knew those people.
Don't shit a shitter.  Our building. What did you call it?  His 'tomb'?  We had an agreement.  You were supposed to sit on it.  Not sell it --
No time for eightball.  I got your tip.
You was just doing your job.
Fuckin' comedian.  See you tomorrow.
Yeah, you heard of him?
I'm not joking boy.  Don't feed it. It'll only make it hungrier.
You hear that, bitch?  Be quiet!
You're a dead man!  A fucking dead man!
No!
Give it to me.
What the fuck is going on?
What?  It ain't no big fuckin' deal. I know who Don hires.  Did you know he did time himself?
It couldn't have been.
It's impossible!
I mean it, Caesar, forget Johnnie, forget the money, let's just go now, before it's too late --
He can't kill you --
Not until he has the money!
Caesar, stop acting like an asshole and think --
Don't try to tell me what to do.
Sure, Gino, sure.
I should have let him kill you.
I knew I couldn't trust you.
What are you going to do, V?  Shoot me?  Kill me in cold blood?  I don't think so.  I'll tell you why.  If you had it in you to pull that trigger, you would have done it a long time ago.  If I was you, I would have killed me the minute I brought the money home.  But you didn't and I know why, because you don't want to kill me.  Do you, V?  Do you? No, I know you don't.
Pretty good, sir.
It's all right, sir.
Good idea.
What?  How about a drink?
Good.  Sit tight.  I'll call you.
I was buzzing, I was knocking, but I guess you couldn't hear me on account of being in the shower.
Why'd you move all the furniture around?
This is the police, ma'am.
You did the right thing.
A favor?
Yes, it really causes problems. Sometimes it's like you're in the same room.  But if it's too much trouble, I understand ...
No, no trouble.  There's other work to do.
Sure.
They took over a club I was working at.  Caesar started managing it.
Yes, it is.
Shit, here we go.
If there is one thing I can't stand about sleeping with women, it's all the fucking mind reading.
If those quarters fell to the floor, would you still reach up to that cash register?
Who is Gino?
He does it right in front of him.
Waiting in the apartment next door.
You are as radiant as ever, Violet.
Pop?
Hey, Johnnie ...
Our last sighting was forty-eight hours ago.  Even if they stayed in the car, the grid is huge.  This is it.  He's trained -- conditioned -- they're built to disappear.  You give him another day to run and we may never find him.
-- if we can get a clean shot --
Treadstone?
...headaches...you have that...I get such bad headaches...
...someone said caffeine -- for a headache...doesn't seem...

Yes, sir...  How can I help you?
Really.
That'd be great.
You swear?  That's great.  I feel so much better now.
I don't want to go alone.  I want you to drive me to Paris.  Like we're a couple.  Like we're a couple and we're travelling together.  That's all we're doing.
And I don't get hurt.  I get twenty thousand dollars and I don't get hurt.
Then I'll find another ride.
No.
You're paranoid.  You were shot. It's natural.
I dream I'm asleep.  I dream that I'm asleep and I can't wake up.  I don't think I smoke.
He went out the window -- why? -- why would someone do that?
No.
-- we'll tell them what happened --
We have to keep moving.
xxxxxx
xxxxxx
Shit, we didn't sign in.
What's that?
-- we're in the middle of a trade meeting! --
No.
Thank you.
I haven't got an emergency. Get out of here.
...elephoned sir.
I think you've got your T41 crystal inductor wired up to a reverse bobbin- threaded-solenoid-control. It's either that or a new washer.
Sign the form so we can get to it.
Well not exactly. But, if you help us we'll help you. The Forces Of Darkness have won the day ... but, tomorrow is another one
Mr Helpmann. I've changed my mind. I'd like to accept the transfer - am I too late?
I understand, Sam, I know exactly how you feel. So I brought you a bottle of barley water.
Please, I've got to find Jill.
You sound worried.
You remember Alison?
Remember how they used to stick out?
SAM! What a surprise!
Not really, no.
I'm sure you have
Very smart.
She witnessed the Tuttle arrest - the Buttle arrest - and since then she's been making wild allegations, obviously trying to exploit the situation - she's working for somebody, and she's not working for us.
Look after that suit, eh. Barbara chose it for me.
Right. Er, you're not going to keep calling her Barbara, are you?
Why?
Take her off the list.
There's no procedure for that until she's been arrested.
Er ... alright. For Christ's sake don't lose it. Here, you'd better sign for it.
I'm sorry, Sam, I'm afraid this whole case has become much more complicated since last we talked.
She's innocent, Jack --- she's done nothing wrong.
Sam - we've always been close, haven't we?
Where do I get it stamped?
Information Adjustments.
It's you ... it's you ...
I don't want to hear about your fucking dreams!
I didn't run away. I left the flat.
Why not?
Ah ... Er ... It looks as if you're taking me.
Well, no system is.
Say, all wars have innocent victims.
Security.
What?
Are you still following me?
There are plenty of other safe places. Why don't we go back to my flat?
Oh ... Jesus!
No. No. I'm fine. I was worried sick about you ... I thought ...
Are you sure?
Yes.
Where are you going?
I'm going to pull some strings. It's our only hope.
Information Retrieval.
You've been promoted.
What a BITCH!
Tuttle?
I've tried that! Population Census have got him down as dormanted, the Central Collective Storehouse computer has got him down as deleted, and the Information Retrieval have got him down as inoperative ... Security has him down as excised., Admin have him down as completed
Try next of kin.
Call the motor pool and authorise personal transport.
Here.
What's the matter?
You don't happen to know how I can get around an IRQ/3 do you?
All information on 3rd Level Suspects is classified.
All enquiries to Information Retrieval. Which is hopeless, of course. They never tell you anything. But come the time they want something from us ...
I did it for you.
She didn't say anything about it to me.
Yes he is - he wants to talk to you.
I think that'll hold it.  Hello Shirley. Just helping someone tie up a Christmas present. How are you?
Thank you for calling Central Services. I am sorry, due -
What? Who is this?
I'm glad to see the Ministry's continuing its tradition of recruiting the brightest and best, sir.
I don't know which numero.
I'm sorry, but I'm a bit of a stickler for paper work. Where would we be if we didn't follow the correct procedures?
Thermostat's gone. And then some.
I'll fire you tomorrow. Hell, better than that, I'll forward you some sick time. A week, two weeks off-- how about that?
You can trust me on this one.
Mary, we really have to go.
Red Death?  Tell me something, Frank--does killing your clients make good business sense to you? The kids selling that shit have no sense. They'll be taken care of, don't worry about that.
I can't hold up my head anymore.
I was tired. I needed a coffee.
I usually don't do calls before coffee. But I think it might do you some good.  Twelve Young is here and I'm gonna take care of you, baby. Don't you worry about a thing, yahear, cause Marcus is alive and on arrival.
Ten-four, hon.  This is for you.
That's my brother's problem. He's passed out inside.
It's best not to ...  It's good pizza, huh?
How long you been doing this?
I better go check on my father. Thanks for the pizza. I owe you one. Maybe when he gets better, you know, when we're done with all this.
No, I'll be fine. I'm just visiting a sick friend.
Fifteen minutes.
No, we just ate. I only remember how tough my father was. Now I know he had to be like that, to make us tough. This city'll kill you if you aren't strong enough.
No, the city doesn't discriminate. It gets everybody.
Come on up.
You ever notice people who see shit always, are crazy?
She loves me the way no woman ever has.
She's the daughter of a cardiac arrest I brought in last night. I told her we'd give her a ride back to Misery. Her father's showing signs of improving.
She's no whore, Marcus.
We're all whores, Frank. You know what I'm talking about, the way she looked at me.
Backup?
Who knows? It's all lower-brain-stem- activity. The heart refuses to stabilize--he's coded eleven times since he got here. This guy's a fighter. Every time the Valium wears off he starts yanking those restraints.
Come on, Frank. There's blood spilling in the streets.
I feel the need, the need for speed. I'm driving out of myself.
You okay?
You want some bum in the bus terminal? We'll wait for a real call.
What do you want to break?
Let me think.
I'm so stupid. I had beef lo mein last night. I can't eat the same thing two nights in a row. It's almost two o'clock, what the hell am I gonna do? What you getting?
Oh yeah, you don't eat food.
Coffee and whiskey, lucky you ain't dead with that diet. Wait, I've got it. Half fried chicken with fries. Let's go, hurry up. Come on.
You have no sick time, Frank. No time of any kind. Everyone knows that.
Yeah, you're right.
I made one rule for myself when this started and I realized I was going to take a lot from you people because of being from sports...
And the rule was...
Okay.
It's not loaded.
Okay, I'll see you in the lobbies [<i>sic</i>].
Sure.
You want to start going over who they could have gotten?  They can't take on people like this for network news.  For God's sake.  What's going on?
If we don't get to their camp soon, we won't be able to tape the supplies coming in.
Thanks.  The F-14 is one of the most difficult planes to master.  Oh, you call them 'Tomcats' and in the 70's the first crop had a number of crashes.
Do you feel good about it?
No.
Stop.  Ernie thought I was good too -- he couldn't help.  My agent has a hot prospect -- the number two station in Portland.  The general manager says he wants to be every bit as good as the networks.  Personally, I think he should aim higher.
Tell me the God's honest truth -- are you leaving because of me? Because if you are...
I'm gonna go look at it again.
Yeah --
I'm no suggesting the worst will happen...but someone with your brilliance gets nibbles about other jobs and maybe, the next time that happens, down the road -- you should look into it.
All I know is that they've got to fire a large number of people... and they're not going by seniority. There's a recklessness in the air. They...
Take care, Paul.  It takes a certain kind of courage for you to say that in front of the President of the News Division.
Bill...This is hard on all of us and it's no time for compliments. But I think it's extraordinary of you to come down here for this.
If we're not here for each other during the tough time, we're not a news organization.
Yes.  How do you know?
I'll speak to you.
Tell me I'm on the way in.
No.  They're firing even more people than they said.  Some will want to talk.  It could help.
Okay, sweetie.
You don't have to finish tonight.
I don't know.
I just wanted to tell you  how great you were.  My name's Tom Grunick.
I was a lot earlier.
Nooo.  If I could just have a roll, I'd be okay.
So great -- right?
You  make me nervous.  Anyway if I can pick your brain --
I just got back -- I don't know which end is up.
Okay.
Yes.
Some public official skipped a week on his Christmas Club?
Indescribable -- you knew just when to feed me the next thing, just a split second before I needed it.  There was a rhythm we got into, like great sex.
Well, I thought I'd check if all of you were still here.  I'll just go in and join the gang and you two go on.
Too many smart people in one room -- it's not healthy...
I just read about it in a magazine and it affected me.
Yes, Tom -- I think I can manage.
Why, you need me for the story?
I like you as much as I can like anyone who thinks I'm an asshole.
Uh-uh.
Well...
Because you're nuts.
I'm not sure.  It seems like he had sort of a mishap on the news.
Okay.  Good night.
Jane, I'm not some chore you have to finish so you can stay on schedule.
How can you say that to me?
It's just that one of the few things I'm not confused about is what I was saying downstairs, that...
It's better when you let me say it.
Right back to you.
This is my first time at the White House. Is there any chance to look at where he works and the rest of it?
It would never occur to me to worry at all about you.
I just might.
What, right now?
Are you nervous, Walter?
When's the last time you had a totally nude girl in your room...
I'll pose any way you want.
What did he do?
Of course...it's wonderful.
What's it called?
Yeah it was all just an accident.
Let's see it.
Me too.
Walter!  Jeez!
Sorry...
I know.  But I wanted to talk to you.
Carla -
You just can't be sorry! I wanna - I wanna marry you!
Oh sure, let's string along poor Walter, see how far it will take us!
Oh yes...very nice...very, very nice...
I've never seen anyone so... squeamish.  Well, what's your opinion, Leonard?
Why not?
Well, it all depends, Leonard...
Not only that, he copied us!
I think he's looking for you, man... it's all finally catching up with you!
Looks like that cat paid off in spades.
Didn't you hear him?
Well make a dog, make a parakeet! I'm sure you'll think of something.
A parakeet?
I don't know, it just happened, I guess.  I didn't mean to.
Well Why not?  I gotta make statues Leonard.  You heard Maxwell, they want me to make them.  I can't go back to being a busboy!
Well, w-what did you do?
Never mind...
Excuse me I have to make a call...
Telling you what?
Haven't you ever heard of smack! Horse!  Junk!  Heroin!
Call me...Maxwell.
Good morning Walter!
Suit yourself.
Your work, the layers of irony.
Then let me give you something then...
That's it, man.  That's the whole story.
Let me in.
You look like shit, Benny.
My bike!  She's a lesbian, too. She told me.
Hi, guys.
Maybe.
What's Bobby gonna say?
I do?  I guess I do.
Oh, come on, Buffy.  You know what's going on.  It's not working out at all.  I've got to move on.  I mean, I've got needs, too.  I told you about all this.
You broke up with my machine?
Yeah, I was bailing.  I have a friend, and he's really... well, he's really vampire, I guess.  Bad scene.
It's nothing.  It doesn't hurt.
It's weird.  I went back to my old grade school once, to the playground -- I used to hang out there all the time, playing on the swings and stuff... I went back and it was so tiny, the whole place.  I couldn't even fit on the swings.  Everything just looked so small.  I'm sorry.  I'm babbling.
I know.
Oh, God.  It's him.  I think it's him.
I'm going shopping.  Don't try to stop me.
Come again?
Bogutude.  Blow it off.
Not at all.  My name is Merrick.  I was sent to find you some time ago. I should have found you much sooner but there were...  complications. You should have been taught, prepared.
Time to do what?
Just for protection.  You won't have to do anything.  I just need you to watch.
Do you know what a Vampire-King is?
Great.  First I have a birthright, now I've got a fate.  Hey, do I have to take notes on this?
Who we gonna beat?
No -- you don't have to --
I don't want to be the chosen one, okay?  I don't want to spend the rest of my life chasing after vampires!  I just want to graduate from high school, go to Europe, marry Charlie Sheen and die.  It may not sound too exciting to a sconehead like you, but I think it's swell.  And then you come along...  and... and then I'm a member of the hairy mole club, so you throw things at me!
Oh, several.  Lucretia Borgia, Joseph Mengele, Franklin Pangborn... are any of those names familiar?
Oh.
And the alley was a mistake.  Never corner yourself like that.  If they'd come at you in force you'd be dead now.  One vampire is a lot easier to kill then ten.
Oh, wonderful.  My secret weapon is - PMS.  That's just great.  Thanks for telling me.
You are such a wet.
And why are you always wearing black? It's so down.  It's totally not your color.  I don't think you have a color.
Oh, fuck you!
Not if you're careful.
Well... there's my keen fashion sense, for one.
Merrick.  You made a joke.  Are you okay, I mean, do you want to lie down?  I know it hurts the first time.
But it's in the back.  Why are we wasting time with this, anyway?
Excuse me for not knowing about El Salvador.  Like I'm ever going to Spain anyway.  Ooh!
They don't even have Dolby.
Yeah... She's okay, though.
My parents have money...
I don't understand.
I'm just a girl.
Okay, what else?
Oh, baby!
You're kidding.
Snapped.  Buffy was, you know, on the upswing, and I swear to God she went across the room.  Perm over heels.
Well, that's the thing.  She landed on her feet.  Didn't even sprain a toe.  And I go up to her and she turns and looks at me and she's like this --
I'm sorry.  I'm Pike.  This is Benny.
Nice much.
Weird?  You mean like you hanging out with that homeless, Poke?  I saw you last night after the game.
You're so out of it.  You've blown off cheerleading, you've blown off dance committee --
Run.
What?
They'll fit snugly against your balls in such a wonderful way that you'll start seeing things differently--plus they'll remind you of me which is better than thinking about those nasty hitters.
Catch?
Switch nostrils?
I did.
I think I'm ready for the Show.
"I didn't get lured and I will take responsibility for my actions".
We all deserve to wear white.
I'm not interested yet.
Yep.
I think Thomas Pynchon's a genius.
Young men are uncomplicated.  And he's not "dim".  He's just inexperienced.  My job is to give him "life-wisdom" and help him make it to the major leagues.
Let me.
I want you desperately!
I doubt that.
I said when I think about you, I get wet.
Thurman Munson.  He was covered with dirt and he was fighting with everybody--it was beautiful ...  And he called the ump a cocksucker and got thrown out of the game even though it was an exhibition!  So I stayed in the bleachers all spring and gradually came to understand what's so great about baseball.
Are you gonna be waking up next to 20 year old ballplayers when you're 60?
Whatta you mean "why not"?  Are you gonna play forever?!
What?
I can do that, too.
He looks great, just great!
He looks wonderful, Jackson...
Uh oh...  Can I offer you some coffee?
Praise the Lord, eh?
Which one of us?
The socks?  It's cold in here.
Never heard of 'em.
Shh, shh...  "They will not let me off till I go with them, respond to them, and discorrupt them and charge them"
Beg me!
You're a cocksucker!
Well, I held it like an egg.
He did know.
Yep.
I won't have to.
God--what a Big League move.
I want you to throw this one at the bat rack.
It's time you started working on your interviews.
What do I gotta do?
You outta your mind?  If you give in now you might start losing.  Never fuck with a winning streak.
I have been known, on occasion, to howl at the moon.  D'you understand that?
The Crash Davis. ) And you, Larry Hockett, should recognize me 'cause five years ago in the Texas League when you were pitching for El Paso and I was hitting cleanup for Shreveport, you hung a curve on an 0-2 pitch of a 3-2 game in bottom of the 8th and I tattooed it over the Goodyear Tire sign, beat you 4-3-- and I got a free wheel alignment from Goodyear.
'Cause of Ebby Calvin LaLoosh.  The Big Club's got a hundred grand in him-
You can keep going to the ballpark and keep gettin' paid to do it.  Beats hell outta working at Sears.
Love to--
From what I hear you couldn't hit a bull in the ass with a slingshot
We'll be praying for you.
No.  The guy's professional debut and he forgets about it.
Eight and sixteen?!  How'd we ever win eight?  Jose, what's this sign?
Some kid hittin' .300 in Lynchburg ...probably a bust.
This is his state. His uncle's Chief Judge. His brother-in-law runs the County Commission. I don't know how many other relatives he's got in town.  There's gotta be a way to work him back in.
It's like everything else in this place. You don't do it yourself, it never gets done.
Good to see ya.  William would you...
You were never my guest?!
That's right.
Was I at that dinner?
I don't know, he doesn't listen to me. Maybe he should...  get lost for a while. Take a vacation. Would that be so bad?
I would forget about the maneuver. I would just get out.
I mean, Frank Marino was there to meet him, but so were the cops. This time they wanted to pinch him for some diamond burglary in Antwerp.
Not bad, not bad. In fact, uh, my wife's pregnant again.
Right away.
Okay.
If his girlfriend was knocked up.
Nick, I gotta tell you, I got pinched twice for no reason. You really gotta be careful. I'm running a licensed place. Everything's legit.
Yeah, he had a fool-proof scheme, all right. It wasn't very scientific but it worked. When he won, he collected. When he lost, he told the bookies to go fuck themselves. What were they gonna do? Muscle Nicky?  Nicky was the muscle.
Me? That's why the bosses sent me out here. They wanted me to make sure none of the other crews robbed the joint. Like these two fuckin' balloon-heads over here [EDDY and JERRY]. They were gonna try and bang us out of two hundred fuckin' grand?  Yeah, right, I'm sure.
To begin, I put money out on the streets, chargin' three points a week. You know - juice to the fuckin' dealers.
No.
All right.
I'm not tryin' to tell you what to do. But you were way out of line, Nick. What're you doin'? Where's your head?
Yeah, that's out of context. Okay.
Yeah.
Okay?
Your fuckin' head is getting' bigger than your casino. That's your problem, pal.
The coppers blamed me for everything that went wrong out here, and I mean every little fuckin' thing too.
Meet me at three.
You want me to get out of my own fuckin' town?!
I -
Your fuckin' ass! You could have had the food and beverage job without goin' on television!  You wanted to go on TV.
Yeah, I did want to go on TV. That way I have a forum. I can fight back. I'm known. People see me. They know they can't fuck around with me like they could if I was an unknown. That's right.
Me?! I wouldn't even be in this situation if it wasn't for you. You brought down so much fuckin' heat on me. I mean, every time I meet somebody here, the big question is do I know you.
Get this through your head, you Jew motherfucker, you. You only exist out here because of me!  That's the only reason!  Without me, you, personally, every fuckin' wiseguy skell [Skell: the lowest form of wiseguy - a drunken bum] around'll take a piece of your fuckin' Jew ass! Then where you gonna go?!  You're fuckin' warned! Don't ever go over my fuckin' head again! You motherfucker, you!
Yeah, she's with that cocksucker again... and they got Amy.
Hey, be fuckin' nice. Calm. Be nice. Don't fuck up in here.
How do you do?
You have got me there. Old Don is as useless as tits on a boar.  But, he is my brother-in-law, and I would look on it as a personal favor if you'd think some more on hirin' him back.
You see?  Never tells me nothin'. Ace, what do we got on for next week?
Okay. You come by the house?
Half of everything is mine.
Well, sir, I was just...
Why is she eight pounds over?
L'chaim. [Yiddish for 'to life']
The little guy. He's half in the bag, and nobody told him he was eighty- sixed from the joint, so we...
Oh, no.
He's gonna come up with ten thousand, just the way you wanted.
Ginger's mission in life was money.
I hit a few... uh, games on the way back.
Hey, Mitch.
...pit bosses, floor managers.
We're not getting any younger. Don't you think it's time? Aren't you gettin' tired of all this shit? Bangin' around, hustlin' around?
I'm gonna do you one better. I'm trying to marry you. You want to marry me?  I'm serious. I mean, I - I want to settle down. I want a family.
I - I - I...
You know I'm doin' well now. And I'm gonna do even better. And so, whatever happens, if it doesn't work out between us, I'm gonna make sure you're okay for the rest of your life. And if there are kids, especially, you know, I'll take care of you better than you'd ever imagine.
It's all right. That part of your life is over with. Right?
Uh-huh.
Oh...
Oh, fabulous.
You get her?  Okay.  Well, I need a lot. I need more than usual.
Yeah.
Why do you need that much?
Who's fighting? I mean, I'm, you know, tell me what it's for.
Okay, okay.
I don't need one.
How could you say that?  You're a beautiful woman. You're destroying yourself. You don't need that stuff. You don't need that fuckin' leech livin' off you. I know you better than you know yourself. You're a tiger, you're stronger than I am. And when you set your mind on doing something, you do it better than anybody.  You can do it.  You can do it.
Oh, God. Oh, God. Okay.  Okay... I'll try. I'll try.
Look in my eyes. Look in my eyes.
Listen...
...please. That's all I'm askin' you.
Uh,  I don't know. I gotta tell you, I don't know.
...I-I... made some mistakes and I spent some money.
Twenty-five thousand for clothes and a watch.
Would you knock it off, Sam?
I'm just tryin' to figure it out.
You'll come back tomorrow and get the rest. Just get out of here.
She had the same.
Okay. I want you to call Jennifer and I want you to tell her to tell you what she had for lunch, and I'm gonna listen in on the other line.
Get down here and talk to me, goddamn it! Don't fuckin' ignore me! You motherfucker!
Dang, you are right, Mr Rothstein, I am so sorry.
This is not the way to treat people.
Well, I... I never tried.
All right, I'm gonna give you a choice. You can either have the money and the hammer or you can walk out of here. You can't have both. What do you want?
What?
...I got muscled on the street.
Well, then, from now on, I'm gonna start keepin' records.
You're goin' out to Las Vegas, you're havin' a good time at my expense. What the fuck? I mean, after all, you're the one having a good time, not me.
Hi. Good.
What're you gonna do? Strong-arm me?
Hey!
Now move along.
You fuckin' faggot! Do you know who you're fuckin' with?
Here we go!
Is that what you did?
Tell him to go fuck himself? You fuckin' hick!  Fuckin'...
Fuckers!
I know.
And I mean... that's no good.
What could I say? I knew if I gave the wrong answer, I mean, Nicky, Ginger, Ace, all of 'em could've would up gettin' killed.
No. I ain't see anything like that.
I'll be right out.
Mm.
Fine.
Yeah. He's just a friend of mine I was trying to help, so... so what?
You know... the first time I ever saw your guys together... I never saw him so happy. I mean, I know he's a crazy Jew fuck and everything, but...
You mean, like a lot of expensive jewelry? About how much?
No. I - I'm just curious, you know. I was wonderin' how much he would put into a thing like that. That's all.
Well, there you go. But what does that tell ya? A million dollars in jewelry. Does that tell you the guy is crazy about you, or what?
Okay.
You're a beautiful girl. You don't want to ruin your looks. I've seen a lot of girls get shot to hell from this stuff.
You're so nice. 
No, I really do. I think he's gonna kill me.
Hm.
Yes, you did.
Come on, come on, you're a toughie. You can take this.  Don't cry.
Come on. Don't be scared.
I told you this was fuckin' dangerous. Remember I said, 'Ginger, this is a dangerous situation. Be very careful.' You fuckin' yessed me to death.
Oh, well, then, have him killed and get it over with.
That bag's full of fuckin' chips you
Yes.
God... I wish you...
Get your bag! Come on, get your bag! Get your things! Let's go!
She started it. She started the whole thing. I'm just standin' here.
I took care of everybody.
Hey, Shelly. 
It's up to you.
I don't trust him anymore. But they'd never okay anything, you know?
Did I say to do anything yet? I said I'm not sure... I'll let you know. I want to think about it. Where're these pricks at?
Why'd I get involved with this fuckin' nut in the first place? Get out!
How you doin'?
Yeah.
Yeah, I know, that's why you had it ready. You thought I was fuckin' layin' it?!
...this, uh, this Commission is prepared to act on a motion denying the Rothstein application.
Do I hear a motion seconded?
Mr. Chairman -
I know it, I know it.
You know, I - I'm too upset right now. And - An end has to be put to this.
You are right. What can I...
It's okay. Let her go.
Ayy!  Some cat's blocking the periscope.  Somebody, give it a swat...
Oops--my face must match my cape. And to think we were going to let you go...
In women?
You're telling the truth. I can tell..How did this..
A couple that battles the forces of evil together is a couple that stays together.  Thank you, Jeff.
We'll hunt him down together...
They do take their time. So..Selina Kyle...
I've been looking for you.  Selina Kyle was right. One of us is a psychotic crusader.
I've been thinking. I've been thinking about us. I'm sorry I've been so hard no you these past couple days. I realize now it's because you're the only woman who ever understood me and I couldn't handle it!  I've never revealed myself to anyone the way I have to you. Let's blow this town together.  We'll run a bed-and-breakfast in Vermont by day, and by night, we'll dress up and kill anything that...
Pass!
I hate innocent bystanders.  Whine, whine, whine. Will he settle?
He didn't remember to roll up his window...
Touchy. Look everybody, it's Casper, the friendly crimefighter...
Now he'll be up all night...
I hate it when you get like this. This Catwoman is becoming an obsession. I say we call it a night. Tomorrow is a big day for us...
You've seen me...
You can't get away with..
"Save the City?" I don't want to save the city, I want to move!  Listen, I'm sure the computer disc is pretty fascinating and I can't thank you enough for the little weird gold thingie, but..
You Career girls have no idea what we go through.
What did--?
Oh, do you turn around every time somebody just shouts at you?
Actually, yes.
You can't figure me out. You're the strange one..
It's funny, I've heard of giving up finding a man and raising a family to pursue a career. And I've heard of foregoing a career to start a family-- but I think you're onto something new, Selina. "Absolutely nothing"-- Has a ring to it. I think it could catch on...How's that for sarcasm?
What kind of name is "Brock Leviathan?"
I hate it when you let your hair just hang like that...you have such pretty eyes...
I'm not sad, no, I owe the Captain my life. It's just you think you want to help prevent crime, but you realize that's too complicated. It's a lot more fun to punish crime. Then after a while, you don't care what's a crime and what's not, what you became a Warrior for. You just want the kicks. The rush.
Taking messages.
Me, he won't stay on the phone with for five fucking minutes without bitching.
I'm not finished.  Under other circumstances I'd gladly go out of my way.  I don't understand why you just don't phone some other person.
Look -- I've got the lives of maybe three innocent people hanging on the end of this line.
I improved on the fucking original.
Sure -- and they record your voice.  And later on we all get slammed for kidnap and murder. That's out!
Allow me.
Any minute.
If this is some sales pitch I'm not buying --
One of them <u>is</u> a cop.
Listen, there's an overpass coming up.  I may lose you for a minute.
Just hang on.  I've got a life of my own.
What about the others?
I kind of dropped them off.  They were getting on my nerves.
What are you doing now?
I don't know.  80 or 90 minutes, tops.
I've lost you.  You're gone.  I can't hear anything.
I've got to ask somebody.
Don't say anything.  Don't alarm them.  Just go!
The City National on San Vincente.
Black Mercedes, 600S.
The front door slammed.  Someone went out.  There's a different car starting.
Because you're probably the last person I'll ever talk to.
God, if he doesn't come back --
They wrapped tape around my wrists and ankles.
She's awake but she hasn't spoken. I don't know what they did to her. I don't want to think about it.
So far they're keeping their part of it.
Somehow I got along better with you on the phone.  It's all there isn't it?
It belongs to the man you took it from.  Or should I saw <u>stole</u> it from?
At least one.
I got what I fucking deserved.  I had it all.  I could've kept going!
As they say -- no good deed goes unpunished.
Assure them that you're being well treated.
You wouldn't --
Ask them.
That's why we're turning off onto a fire road.
I can't hear.  Now there's a siren.  They must be in an ambulance.  What about the money?  Nels?
That's where this Chicano correctional officer first taught me to slap paint on a canvas.  I could copy any fucking thing he put in front of me.
As a child I hated being told how sweet I looked.  That angelic little face wasn't me at all.  I had to hurt people to prove to them they had the wrong image. Sometimes words were enough -- but I wasn't beyond inflicting physical pain in order to be taken seriously.  I enjoyed seeing the shock on their poor faces when they realized who I was.  That same look you gave me when I turned the gun on you.
How about "later?"
That's a reasonable possibility.
What's your point?
Only one way to find out.
Take your hand out of there. Slowly.
You mustn't hang up.
Didn't we play this scene before?
Twenty percent.
Fine.  I want half.  Plus the release of the family.
Got a phone in that van?
308-9962.
Stay there.
Are you trying to panic the women?
I think I've already had a "quickie."  Thank you.
Then you can sue the cops. Collect from both ends.  Tighten your belts.  Here it comes.  Ready?
You couldn't be calling at a worse time, Nels.
Seems not.
Tell the truth, I was going to take a much needed leak.
There's no lady here.
Hold on.
Who the fuck you kidding?  Send me money!
Yeah.
See what, Dil?
Yeah?
Hi, Jimmy.
Persistent.
No. Tell him to go fuck himself.
Fuck it, is what I say.
Jim, Pat, Mick, what the fuck. Long as you remember you're not at Lords.
Consider it how you like. Just get that bloody tart out of here.
What's his name?
Not English.
Must be.
They're jealous.
Why?
The things a girl has to put up with.
Jesus fucking Christ.
Tell me about him.
Can't think. He's dead. In Ireland. He was a soldier. Went there like a fool.
No, depends on nothing.
I'm wondering why you keep his things.
No...
Don't call me that.
Sure I do.
Nothing's wise.
Know what, honey?
Know what I didn't know. And don't call me that.
Kind of wish I didn't.
That's true.... Your soldier knew, didn't he?
Only if you kiss me.
You following me?
I'm sorry, you know that? I'm really sorry.
I'm sorry.
Died...
You didn't.
You tried.
Just don't kick Dil and she'll be touched. Be nice to her and she'll be yours forever.
Let them come then.
Yes.
Then say it.
What happened to Jimmy?
Fergus.
Can't help it. You're doing time for me. No greater love, as the man says. Wish you'd tell me why.
He's hot.
Eddie and Tinker died.
Suits you.
No, what is the thing?
What do you mean?
Of course. I forgot.
And what happens then?
You may be right.
Some judge...
I sincerely hope so.
I'm sure.
Fuck you, too --
Just a girl.
Good.
A hotel?
You being cynical, Hennessy?
Whoever hits him'll be hit, if those men are any good. And I presume you can't get in.
How is it a farce?
Can't we take it off?
Nope. Not handsome at all.
Well, I could say the same about you.
And even if he doesn't die -- you can't just let me loose.
What do you know about my nature?
Only that you're all tough undeluded motherfuckers. And that it's not in your nature to let me go.
Don't you think of it, fucker.
What the fuck were you doing here?
You could have said no.
Best game in the world.
I'm sorry. Didn't mean to offend you, Fergus.
Yes.
Some kinds of women are...
I don't know her.
A story.
You'd know I wouldn't run off.
Nice lady.
Give me the fucking shooter!
It's simple. I like what I do -- I enjoy doing it. There aren't many men who love their work as much as I do. Look around some time.
Is there a Mrs. Canfield?
It's all right -- look.
Why?
That money's not ours, Adam -- if we keep it, we'll be breaking the law.
Well -- it was a place -- a street corner, I think. But I don't --  Hold it. I'm on.
There's not a reason on earth why you should.
No thanks.
Only we call them agents.
Your husband was wanted by the U. S. government.
Voss -- Charles Voss. All right, Mrs. Voss --  -- I'd like you to look at this photograph, please -- by the way, you saw this one, didn't you?  Scott, Cathy, and Ham, Jr.
Stop calling me that! Lampert's the name on the marriage license.
Gladly, only I don't know what you want! You haven't told me.
Oh, Mrs. Lampert! I'd love to see you try and convince them of that!  Oh, dear.
Yes, where?  -- in fifteen minutes. I'll be there.
What does your Mr. Dyle look like, Mrs. Lampert?
In 1944, five members of the O.S.S. -- the military espionage unit -- were ordered behind the German lines for the purpose of delivering $250,000 in gold to the French Underground. The five men --
Can I at least keep the onion soup?
Scobie was able to travel, but Carson Dyle was clearly dying, so they --
Here --  Wait a minute -- how did Carson Dyle get an office in here, anyway?
Starting with his own.
Brian Cruikshank -- it would serve me right if I got stuck with that one.
Open it.
Is that why you dragged me all the way up here -- to ask me that? She has it -- you know that.
Alexander.
There must be some way.
Reggie -- listen to me --
Oh. 
That sounds like their problem.
Lord, I forgot all about it -- Sylvie works late Tuesday nights -- she always leaves him with me. They wouldn't do anything to a little boy, would they?
Do women think it's feminine to be so illogical -- or can't they help it?
What -- like Scobie?
No -- Gene Kelly. Remember the way he danced down there next to the river in 'American in Paris' -- without a care in the world? This is good, want some?
No, about Scobie, I mean. I can't think of any reason why he was killed.
Well!
Well, I can't really blame you -- not now.
No -- he's not the same. Alexander Dyle was interested in clearing up his brother's death. Adam Canfield is a crook. And with all the advantages you've got -- brains, charm, education, a handsome face --
And the last one?
That's right -- it's like ticklin' a alligator's belly.
The kid said --
He didn't have one.
I don't know. I suppose so.
About how wealthy would you say?
I don't know.
Obviously.  One ticket of passage to South America -- one letter, stamped but unsealed, addressed to you --
And this? And this?
I don't blame him. Jean-Louis -- do you know where this Monsieur Flix lives?
Is there a Mr. Lampert?
I'm not sure I --
Well, you go in and you ask for some toothpaste -- the small size -- and the man brings you the large size. You tell him you wanted the small size but he says the large size is the small size. I always thought the large size was the largest size, but he says that the family size, the economy size and the giant size are all larger than the large size -- that the large size is the smallest size there is.
Shakespeare never said that.
How do you know?
Is there only one Charles Lampert?
It's in all the afternoon papers. I'm very sorry.
Thank you.
Yes it is -- I heard it this morning.
Doing what?
Come on. You can't stay here.
Who said?
Stop this nonsense! If you're in some sort of trouble I want to know about it.
Out of the window, I guess -- I didn't see him.
There are three men -- he's one of them -- they think I have something that belongs to them.
Of course I'll help -- I told you I would, didn't I? Come on now --
Do you tell lies?
What is it, Reggie -- what's he saying?
Yes, ma'am. A little one -- 'bout seven or eight years old. Th' little tyke keeps callin' you his Aunt Reggie -- ain't that cute?
But what?
I admit I moved to Paris because I was tired of American Provincial,
I don't know.  But if this is a sample of American diplomacy I'm buying a fallout shelter.
What?
Yeah? What's that?
He should. Four guys hit on me today, and not because they find me intellectually stimulating.
As fucking if.
Ok not your imports. All your other CDS and your K2 snowboard.
She's my daughter, Tom.
Better than a pile of dead teenagers.
Dad ! Most of my friends can stay out until 11 on school nights and 1 on weekends!
How much further?
Are you sure?
Are you sure?
We're seeing all the signs in town.
She's still a virgin.
She's underage.
I'm looking for Lisa Sherman.
I don't give a fuck what your reasons are. You pay me ten dollars, you can go inside Otherwise, get a warrant.
Daddy....
No. I couldn't do that. I have something for you.
You think I should go to the party, Mr. Marliston?
I was born nine months after she was raped. One of the four men who raped her is my father. I have no idea which one.
Yes that's the whole point. This is what I was put on this earth to do. Rape the town that raped my mother. Steal its pristine innocence like it stole hers. I've planned this since I was a very little boy. You have no real freedom either. Your father has cast a shadow that you've never eluded.
You think you're my sister?
You stare at him non-stop, like every lunch. Like this. Like most people stare at car accidents.
You're going to look really amoebic splitting off from me now.
But you can't do any of it. So it sucks. I always have to 'set an example'.
OK. increase the peace.
There will be a lot fewer by tomorrow night.
Didn't you have something a little more romantic in mind for your first time?
I kind of like the idea that we can all lose it together, on the same night. It'll be a lot less scary. You have to go.
Stag?
I'm fine.
I was worried about you. Did you hear about the bash?
Yes you are. You always do. It's why we broke up. You always hide behind him.
I feel like I NEED YOU DAD'S permission just to kiss you. Jody, it's time to assert yourself To be a big girl. An individual. I'm going to this party tonight. Jimmy's my ride. Come over to my house after school. We'll go together.
I don't know. Where did you hear that name.
What?
No, I believed her. She was in pretty bad shape. Inside and out. But the boys were never formally charged.
Why not?
The word is Mob.
You're not telling me something.
Hi Sandy.
You're the one who's hand is shaking.
ROD!

EXT. ROAD - DAY.

No, no, no.  You don't need my truck. You need somebody else's truck...
No.
What did you do that for?  It makes him mean as a snake.

No, no, no, no, no.  We gotta go to McGruder!  I go where the truck goes!
Borrowed.
Hey.

Okay.  All right.  Okay. 
I'm a dangerous man!
Yeah, he's a dangerous...

You're fucked, man.
See, now why would you do that to a man in my posi-...
Hey, I told you I did not steal that truck.  Andy owes me a lot more than that four-wheeled...
And he swore, he swore once I got a degree...
Yeah, Robert Del Rio.
I remember him.  Got in a car crash or somethin'.
Never gonna throw a ball in the pros.

Oh.
 Okay.

Stop.

Okay.  Okay.
 It says forty- nine.
What?

Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Let's go!

Always the negative...
...that Army nut job to save your narrow butt?
...I feel that my government owes me a little restitution.
I'll handle this from here, sweet   Owes us a little restitution.
Thank you.
Bullshit, yeah.  Well...if we're not gonna be famous, at least this'll be a great story to tell some ladies in a bar or somethin'.
My code name was Blackjack.  Night Shift was my coach.  Uh-Uh-Uh, I'm sorry. Mason was my coach.
It's for you.
I don't ever wanna see another ice cream...
Oh, my God.
Hey!
I ain't got time to argue with you today, Andy.  But I can tell you this.  Takin' your truck pissed you off?
 Look, I'm sorry. I'll make it up to you.  Whatever you want.  Please!
We do need your truck.
 ...Mason.  I can barely hear you.
Your country and a lot of innocent people in it...
...owe you.
...to take any extreme measures I deem necessary...
And I changed the schedule.
I don't work for you, Captain Brynner.
...about--
There's nothing to say, doctor.  Someone had to take the fall, and they still need you, whereas...I've never been anything more than a thorn in their collective side, as you once said.
No, go--
Do you think I haven't seen the bodies of those...
...men every time I've closed my eyes?  But after you went away, I--
"Went away."  I like that.
Forget about him.
Good to see you again, Leo.
And I don't like deviations from plans, Leo, as I'm sure you re-...
...-ians.  But I assure you, Leo...

Iced coffee.
Quite a getup for jacking...
I beg your pardon?
It's a little late for matinee heroics, Mason.  Just give me the con-...
It won't be long, gentlemen.



Oh.  Well, I have got to get to the dentist be-...
Oh, no?

You know, I have yet to get a simple cup of coffee and a meal in this place, Darlene.
INT. U.S. RESEARCH LABORATORY/CORRIDOR - NIGHT.
Gomez, you fight the battles you can win.  Now, we've been outmaneuvered here.  Brynner's next move is gonna be to get Elvis out of the country and sell him to the highest bidder.  To do that, he has to have planned an exit point.  That's where we intercept him.  That's where we make our play.  Now you and your men back off.
...son.
Missoula's reporting the refrigerator truck as a stolen vehicle.  I told you Mason was walking shit.
I don't suppose you'd like to tell me what this is all about.
Been trying to figure out your secret.
Yeah.  Ten months we've been fishin' this river together.  We use the same equipment, more or less...

So reaction temperature is fifty degrees.
I got eight thousand yards. Radius is five...
Where are you now...
...badge someday, then you can ask the questions.  Until then...
So you don't remember...
I don't sell beer to minors.  I take that kinda thing...
...seriously.
You know, I gotta tell you.  That really bothers me, somebody calls me "son."
EXT. DARLENE'S STORE - NIGHT.

INT. GOMEZ'S HELICOPTER - DAY.
That's right.
But that means that most of the valley's been sold in the last few months.
Can I check one of these volumes out?
Yes, sir, that's what it looks like. I'll give you that.
Maybe.
I didn't realize you and Hollis were so fond of each other.
If you want to hire me, I still have to know what you and Mulwray were arguing about.
Well... she's an extremely jealous person. I didn't want her to find out about the girl.
Yes... I think I can manage...
That you killed Hollis Mulwray.
Just incorporate the Valley into the city so the water goes to L.A. after all. It's very simple.
I have no idea. How much do you want?
I want to know what you're worth. Over ten million?
Who do you blame for that? Her?
Two hours... tell me, will Evelyn be there as well?
Right now, Curly. It can't wait.
I'll throw that in too.
Did you know that you're a very wealthy woman?
Thank you...
Just to be on the safe side, we had Loach here give you a ring.
C'mon, you think you're dealing with a bunch of assholes? Mulwray had salt water in his goddam lungs! Now how did he get that... in a fresh water reservoir?
No, Gittes, you'll show us.
Tell us about it on the way to Pedro.
I'm sorry, Mrs. Mulwray.
Lou, she will kill you. Let her go for now. You don't know.
Gittes, stay outta this.
He... we did... he wouldn't tell me her name.  We quarreled over her... of course. It came as a complete surprise to me.
A private investigator?
Mr. Gittes.
Why?... What on earth for?  Look, Hollis seems to think you're an innocent man.
Well, I've been accused of many things, Mrs. Mulwray, but never that.
I'll stop by.
Please call first.
You left your keys in the ignition.
I have?
If your husband was killed it was.  This can look like you paid me off to withhold evidence.
Well I wouldn't run home and tell him whenever I went to bed with someone, if that's what you mean.
Yes, of course. It was quite a while after. I was just out of grade school when they did that.
Before this I turned on the faucet, it came out hot and cold, I didn't think there was a thing to it.
Everything you can see, everything around us. I was at the Hall of Records today.  That bother you?
No.
No, I think I'd remember.
Get in the car.
Why?
Easy, it's an innocent question.
Actually this hasn't happened to me in some time.
You can't always tell what's going on there.
I know.
That you were jealous, and he was worried about what you might do.
Mulwray's girlfriend, for one thing. He wanted to know where she was.
It's possible.
The police?
What are you doing? What's wrong? I told you we've got a 4:30.
There's no time for you to be shocked by the truth, Mrs. Mulwray. The coroner's report proves he was killed in salt water. Just take my word for it. Now I want to know how it happened and why. I want to know before Escobar gets here because I want to hang onto my license.
...where does Kyo live?
Yes, Mr. Gittes.
Three reservoirs. Men's room of a Richfield gas station on Flower, and the Pig 'n Whistle.
Isn't everybody? What can I do for you, Miss Sessions?
Well I never expected anything to happen like what happened to Mr. Mulwray, the point is if it ever comes out I want somebody to know I didn't know what would happen.
Who?
Perhaps if we could meet your father.
Of course.
Oh, good.
Oh yes. Hollis was the best department head the city's ever had. My goodness, what happened to your nose?
I never was.
Mr. Gittes! That's an outrageous accusation.  I don't know what you're talking about.
Well... I think I... I would've remembered.
Have we ever met?
It's not completely dry.
Yeah, well he ain't gonna drown in a damp riverbed either, I don't care how soused he was. That's like drowning in a teaspoon.
I'm afraid not, Mrs. Mulwray. These men are my operatives and at some point they're going to assist me. I can't do everything myself.
Well I'm on my lunch hour. I'll wait.
He did or he didn't?
When I find out who that phony bitch was.
Yeah. What's wrong with you guys? Think ahead. We find 'em, sue 'em. We'll make a killing.  We'll have dinner at Chasen's twice a week, we'll be pissing on ice the rest of our lives.
Is the Pope Catholic? Who are you, mister?... I ask because he doesn't see a whole lot of people.
She ain't exactly long in the tooth now.
Oh yeah, it was a big thing at the time. Julian Cross' daughter. God almighty. She was a wild little thing.
Oh, you know. She was sixteen or seventeen.
Toto, come here.
No...
It tastes wonderful!
Too bad!
Come in, Alfredo.
Why? What do you mean?
That's right, Modern Times.
What you say is wonderful! But sad...
I want to make you happy, Toto! I'm going to tell you a story.  Once upon a time a king gave a feast and there were all the most beautiful princesses of the realm. Basta, one of the guards, saw the king's daughter: she was the loveliest of all! And he immediately fell in love with her. But what could a poor soldier do compared with a king's daughter?!...One day he managed to meet her and told her he couldn't live without her. The princess was so struck by the depth of his feeling that she said to the soldier  'If you will wait a hundred days and a hundred nights beneath my balcony, then in the end I'll be yours.' Christ, the soldier ran off there and waited! One day, two days, ten, twenty...Every night she looked out of her window, but he never budged. Come rain, wind, snow, never budged! The birds shat on him and the bees ate him alive! After ninety nights he was gaunt and pale and tears streamed from his eyes but he couldn't hold them back. He didn't even have the strength to sleep any more. The princess kept watch...And on the ninety-ninth night, the soldier got up, picked up his chair and left!
Could be...But I don't like this business. It smells fishy to me.
No, nobody came. 
Now I understand why the soldier went away just before the end. That's right, just one more night and the princess would have been his. But she, also, could not have kept her promise. And...that would have been terrible, he would have died from it. So instead, for ninety-nine nights at least he had lived with the illusion that she was there waiting for him... 
No particular reason...  Nice day, huh? 
For you to fall in love with me too. Listen carefully. Every night, when I get off work, I'll come and wait beneath your window. Every night. When you change your mind, open your window. That's all. I'll understand...
Who?
Sure, sure! Boccia...  What's he do?
Somebody stole it.
Mr. Leland, if Mr. Kane, he should decide to drop the price to one cent, or maybe even he should make up his mind to give the paper away with a half-pound of tea - you'll just hold him until I get back, won't you?
I'll write it myself.
Two hundred and one thousand, six hundred and forty-seven.
And the social.  How about the music notice?  You got that in?
Oh, yes, it's already made up.  Our Mr. Mervin wrote a small review.
That Rosebud?  Maybe some girl?  There were a lot of them back in the early days, and -
Sure, sure.
Who else did you see?
Yes.
Mr. Kane is finishing it.
If the headline is big enough, it makes the new big enough.  The murder of Mrs. Harry Silverstone -
That's the kind of thing we are going to be interested in from now on, Mr. Carter.  Right now, I wish you'd send your best man up to see Mr. Silverstone.  Have him tell Mr. Silverstone if he doesn't produce his wife at once, the "Enquirer" will have him arrested.  Have him tell Mr. Silverstone he's a detective from the Central Office. If Mr. Silverstone asks to see his badge, your man is to get indignant and call Mr. Silverstone an anarchist. Loudly, so that the neighbors can hear.
We've got a nice plant here.
Is it good?
It can wait.
Charlie, please don't -
Hmm!
If you want to come in and wash your face -  I can get you some hot water to get that dirt off your trousers -
Thanks.
In the water.
Thanks.
You really don't know who I am?
How old did you say you were?
I want to be a singer.  I mean, I didn't.  Mother did for me.
What happened to the singing? You're not in a show, are you?
Yes, I would.  That's why I asked.
Then you have no alibi at all. Please sing.
Can't we go back, Charlie?
Oh, I don't mean the things you've given me - that don't mean anything to you.  What's the difference between giving me a bracelet or giving somebody else a hundred thousand dollars for a statue you're going to keep crated up and never look at?  It's only money.  It doesn't mean anything. You're not really giving anything that belongs to you, that you care about.
I'm much obliged, Mr. President, for your concern about me.  However, I happen to be concerned at this moment with the matter of extensive oil lands belonging to the people of the United States, and I say that if this lease goes through, the property of the people of the United States goes into the hands of -
Where'm I going?
Yes, sir. 
Persia.  It belonged to a king.
No, I don't, Mr. Kane.
I'd like that.
Charlie -
Do you think you're the one who should call him a great man?
Yesterday morning you called the President a traitor.  What do you think that crowd is doing down there?  They think you murdered him.
Oil belonging to the people of the United States was leased out for a song to a gang of high-pressure crooks -  Nobody can blame me because -
Charlie!  Now you're not making sense.
I'll get you some coffee.
No, that won't help.  Besides, you never get drunk.  I wanted to talk about you and Emily.
Brad, you are drunk.
Why is she leaving me?
You almost convince me.  I'm just drunk enough to tell you the truth.  I have to be a little drunk for that because I'm a coward.  You know that.  That's why you keep me around.  You only associate with your inferiors, Charlie.  I guess that's why you ran away from Emily.  Because you can't stand the company of your equals.  You don't like to admit they exist - the other big people in your world are dead. I told you that.
Are you finished?
Hey, Brad!  I've been analyzed an awful lot tonight - let's have another brandy.
Well, you've been getting a pretty low salary here in New York.  It seems to me that the new dramatic critic of our Chicago paper should get what he's worth. 
If I want to, I can go to court. A father has a right to -
He married for love -  That's why he did everything.  That's why he went into politics.  It seems we weren't enough.  He wanted all the voters to love him, too.  All he really wanted out of life was love. That's Charlie's story - it's the story of how he lost it.  You see, he just didn't have any to give.  He loved Charlie Kane, of course, very dearly - and his mother, I guess he always loved her.  As for Emily - well, all I can tell you is Emily's story as she told it to me, which probably isn't fair - there's supposed to be two sides to every story - and I guess there are.  I guess there's more than two sides -
This is Mr. Thatcher, Charles.
I know, but -
I'm not from a newspaper exactly, I -
You think I'm shitting you...
No, I think I'll drink it in here, thanks.
I think you'd better leave now.
The ones in this town, yes! You encourage their growth, their habit. You're the source in this area, and we're going to shut you down for good! For good, cancer-merchant!
You'd think she was marrying him. What are you watching?
You can hold me down.
You might be let down. I'm not a hermaphrodite.
Territoriality. He was mine first.
I went back there, and Dante was already waiting for me.
He was?
You two better quit it.
I'm not pregnant.
Were you going to tell me or just send me an invitation?
How like her.
I love a macho faade. It's such a turn-on.  What smells like shoe polish?
But you were.
Cute. Tell me you wouldn't want to go out again. After all the talking we've been doing.
So... what? So we should just make pretend over the phone that we're dating?
I'll ask Randal to close up for me when he gets back.
No.
With this guy locked in?
Fuck that! I'm gonna break my crazy neck on this ladder!
I can whip your ass.
Hey, neither did ET; but that was a great movie, right?
What responsibility? You're closing the fucking store to play hockey.
One fight a day with Veronica is about all I can stomach, thanks.
Seven months.
Eight and a half.
Interesting postscript to that story: Do you know who wound up going with Brad Michaelson in the other dark bedroom?
Oh shit, I've got to place an order.
...and she's looking to me for support. And I think that this is leading our relationship to a new level.
What about Veronica?
How do you mean?
Hence, the Empire was a fascist theocracy, and the rebel forces were therefore battling religious persecution.
And the second one was still being built when they blew it up.
And you figured it out?
The second time around, it wasn't even finished yet. They were still under construction.
The quest isn't going well?
Obviously not. Look at all the cartons that didn't make the grade.
You know how much money the average jizz-mopper make per hour?
He's the guy in those nudie-booth joints who cleans up after each guy that jerks off.
I guess not.
Let's hear it.
Jesus, you got a one-track mind. It's always Caitlin, Caitlin, Caitlin...
I know.
Sorry.
I told him I had a game today. It's his own fault.
Can we not talk about this?
Hockey's hockey. At least we got to play.
"It's not like we're gonna sell out."
I still can't believe Caitlin's getting married.
Correct me if I'm wrong, but wasn't she one of the illustrious twelve?
You've had sex with a dead person.
Stop it. This is beneath even you.
She meant nothing to you!
An embarrassing way to die.
That's nothing compared to how my cousin Walter died.
Reach what?
Yeah. Like you said, you know. I guess everyone tries it, sooner of later.
Nobody's there. It's four o'clock on a Saturday. How many people ever come to the store at four on a Saturday?
So the casket fell over! Big deal!
Her fucking body fell out!
I know I'm your hero.
And this is what you rented?
I thought you never sold cigarettes to kids.
Because I'm here.
I swear. I couldn't make this kind of hell up.
I might be leaving early to go out with Caitlin, in which case you'll have to close the store tonight.
I'll read the book.
You're wrong. Things happened today, okay? Things that probably ruined my chances with Caitlin.
Lovely story.
Thanks.
You were over half an hour late. Then all you do is come over here.
You need a ride?
Caitlin Bree. Yeah?
You're Alyssa's sister? Heather?
No fat, but no tone either. You don't get enough exercise.
Hey man, that was a long time ago. Don't let it get to you.
Forget it. I don't want to deal with a guy that sells cigarettes to a five-year-old.  Can I offer you a ride somewhere?
How many times I gotta tell you not to deal outside the store.
All right. How much is Pepsi here?
I can't believe you just rolled a joint in here.
Meaning?
You calling me a liar?
What the hell is that? Resting his eyes! It's not like he's some goddamned air traffic controller!
So I'm told.
Aw, c'mon boy. What's the difference? You said yourself the stuff that's there now is rough.
Yeah. I like the cartoons. They make me laugh. They draw the biggest titties.
I'm not even supposed to be here today!
What were you doing up so late?
Oh, be real! Would you... Would you please hug me?  I just went through a very traumatic experience and I haven't been having the best day so far. Now come on.
These are my opinions based on my experiences with the few women who were good enough to sleep with me.
How many girls have you slept with?
You've slept with twelve different girls?
After dropping a bombshell like that, you owe me. Big.
All right. Name it.
After he gets a blow job, he likes to have the cum spit back into his mouth while kissing. It's called snowballing.
He gets off on it.
Like you said-she snowballed him.
Dante...
WHAT? SOMETHING LIKE THIRTY-SIX?
Thirty-seven?!  My girlfriend sucked thirty-seven dicks!
...And one of those guys was you! The last one, I might add, which-if you're too stupid to comprehend- means that I've been faithful to you since we met! All the other guys I went with before I met you, so, if you want to have a complex about it, go ahead!  But don't look at me like I'm the town whore, because you were plenty busy yourself, before you met me!
Lit 101 got canceled, so I stopped home and brought you some lunch.
The ostrich syndrome: if you don't see it...
I called a locksmith and he said the earliest he could get here it tomorrow.
Explain what? How you were waiting until the time was right, and then you were going to dump me for her?
I don't want to go back with her...
I think it's coming now...
I've been here since six o'clock this morning. Why?
An angry mother called the state division of taxation and complained that the man working at Quick Stop Convenience sold her five-year-old daughter cigarettes today at around four o'clock. Division of taxation calls the State Board of Health, and they send me down here to issue a fine. You say you were working all day, hence the fine is yours.  It's doubled due to the incredibly young age of the child.
I don't fucking know. What am I, his biographer?  Olaf, what part of Russia are you from?
Does he sing in English or Russian?
He is.
Oh, I know. If I had to work here all day, I'd be bloated and out of shape, too.
I hope it feels good.
I hope it feels so good to be right. There is nothing more exhilarating than pointing out the shortcomings of others, is there?
For this kind of hash, you need that kind of cash.
My man is deaf.  I'M GOING TO JOHN K'S PARTY!  Neh.
Yo. I'll see you at that party.  I'll see you there?
You're not?
He didn't ask me to...
Um, do you think you can give me a lift home tonight?
That's cool. Well-you two lovebirds take it easy, all right?
Hey, let's get something straight. If I'm gonna die, I'm gonna die, but you're always gonna be the asshole, so just shoot, alright.
Qualen, glad you stuck around. There should be a few hundred cops looking to meet you.
The clip's not gonna hold!
I'm here for the same reason you are, so let's do it.
Can't pass up another chance to play hero, can you.
There wasn't time for anything else.
What the hell do you know about bad time.  You didn't love her, you didn't have to explain to her family.
If you want, do it.  I don't care.
My pleasure.
You keep it.  Get up there if you can, and if you get a chance, do me a favor and kill him.
Just keep lookin' at me and only think about the distance <u>across</u>. Count it as you go:  One, two...by eight you'll be there.
Help me!  I don't want to die!
Don't say that.  You'll embarrass Frank.
Did I?  I don't know.  Maybe I shouldn't have gone out on that line.  Maybe I panicked.
Then turn it off, Gabe, because it doesn't get any better.
It doesn't matter, anywhere but here.
If it's alright, I'm gonna pick up the rest of my gear.
Hal knows what he's doing.
I haven't climbed in months--you lose the feel.
What are you doing here!?
Where's Hal, what's going on?
Yeah, let's go.
You know me, I'm a night person.
Remember the first time we came up here?
You attacked me.
A simple yes or no would have done.
Up ahead.
Start pulling it apart!  We're climbing down on it.
Never, what?!
That's exactly what I want you to do.
Don't lay any guilt on me. Suicide's a personal thing, best done alone.
There's a lot more where that came from.  You're not leaving again?
I burned it.
Never could save a thing.
The best he can since you gave him nothing.
The only faster way up is the East Face and it's smooth as glass.  Maybe a dozen guys in the world could do it in good weather, only a psycho would try it in a storm.
Sue me.
Hold on, baby, he'll get you.
Acknowledge.  Winds are too strong to get a chopper up there, Are you near any natural shelter? Over.
Now I have jurisdiction!  I said get your weapons.
Ask the questions.
Appreciate it.
Been cured, yeah, that was read out to us. The Inspector read all that out to us. He said it was a very good way.
Long time, is right. I don't remember them days too horrorshow. Don't call me Dim no more, either. Officer, call me.
And you, sir?
Yes. They want to help.
Who are they, sir?
I'm frightfully sorry. There is a telephone in the Public House about a mile down the road. I suggest you use that.
But, missus, this is an emergency. It's a matter of life and death. Me friend's lying in the middle of the road bleeding to death.
Fine, sir, fine.
But first we'd like to find out a few things about you.
Cut out all this clever talk about milicents. Just because the Police haven't picked you up lately doesn't, as you very well know, mean that you've not been up to some nastiness. There was a bit of a nastiness last night, yes. Some very extreme nastiness, yes. A few of a certain Billyboy's friends were ambluenced off late last night, yes. Your name was mentioned, the word's got thru to me by the usual channels. Certain friends of yours were named also. Oh, nobody can prove anything about anybody as usual, but I'm warning you, little Alex, being a good friend to you as always, the one man in this sore and sick community who wants to save you from yourself. Deltoid makes a grab for Alex's joint but finds his hand instead. Alex laughs. Derisively and rises. Deltoid distractedly reaches for a glass of water on the night table, and fails to notice a set of false teeth soaking in them. He drinks from the glass. The clink of the teeth sounding like ice-cubes.
What gets into you all? We study the problem. We've been studying it for damn well near a century, yes, but we get no further with our studies. You've got a good home here, good loving parents, you've got not too bad of a brain. Is it some devil that crawls inside of you?
So now you have the same reaction to music as you do to sex and violence?
Do you still feel suicidal?
Tell me more, Georgie Boy.
I did, sir.
My name is Frederick. As I was saying, Alex, you can be instrumental in changing the public verdict. Do you understand, Alex? Have I made myself clear?
Alexander de Large, sir.
Then your toes belong on the other side of it!!!
Yes, sir, Church of England, sir.
Right. The mothballs, Mister.
Through there for a bath.
Psychiatrist? Huh, do I need one?
Now then, each of these slides needs a reply from one of the people in the picture. You'll tell me what you think the person would say. Alright?
No, no, boy. You really must leave it to us, but be cheerful about it. In less than a fortnight now, you'll be a free man.
Jamey Mack! Be the hokey fly! Holy Mother of God! All the Holy Angels and blessed saints in Heaven preserve us. Alex breaks away but the Tramp toddles alongside him.
Father, I have tried, have I not?
And, Father, I've never been guilty of any institutional infractions, have I?
It has not been used yet in this prison. The Governor has grave doubts about it and I have heard that there are very serious dangers involved.
Have you ever had any attacks of fainting or dizziness?
Sir.
Yeah... Pete the English.
We've only just read about it in the morning papers.
No, no, no. That's enough. He's perfect. I want his records sent to me. This vicious young hoodlum will be transformed out of all recognition.
Thank you.
The ride is free.
I used to play this piece back in high school.
Violin.  I never had the lungs for wind instruments.
Keep it.  Go wild.  Have a party.
...Bottega.  Guy gets in my cab wearing a catcher's mask, I think he's a ballplayer.  You?  Definitely Clarence Darrow.
Big case?
Most of the time.
Like you, I'm good at it.  But at this exact moment in time...like I gotta sumo wrestler on my shoulders until tomorrow morning.
He's...what?  Say again?  We're in cell hell...
Save me the grief.  Step out of the car, sir, and open the trunk.
Did better'n that.
The crowd was most kind.  I was born in 1945, but my life began the night of July 22, 1964.  That was the moment of my conception.  Right here in this very room.
I think...
The fat man on Cherry Street.  The other fat man, Mr. Bulldozer.  The trumpet player.  That leaves two.
...so, his description of Max the cabdriver matches the guy who walked out of Villa Rodeo.  That guy?  That guy is a cabbie.  And you're telling me this cabbie walks into a phone booth and emerges as a meat eater, assassin with heavy trigger time? What's he do, squeeze 'em in between fares?
No harm done, ma'am.
Of course I'm proud.  You know he started with nothing?  Look at him today.  Playing concerts.
Mom, Vincent.  Vincent, my mother, Ida Rilke.
Yo, whassup?
Same fare you talked to last time. The U.S. Attorney...
Hang on.  Carefully...
People are more relaxed.  Less stress, less traffic, better tips.
I'm cool.
Okay, try it now.
It's a mess.
So?
South Central.
Believe it.
I'm...what?  Sorry?
I listen to classical.
Don't even think you're walking away from me.
Teach him how to talk back, suddenly he can't stop.  I'm not playing.
You go every night?
What happened?
Why?
You get benefits?
I don't know.
Some living.
Then what are you?
As in...? 
Geronimo.  When you're really in love, you'll jump.  Off the top of the Empire State.  Screaming 'Geronimo' the whole way down.
Just drop me off.
Sure was.  Pounded the V.C. for this Greek cat named Ari Onasis.
Do you still ride?
Love.
For what?
People more serious about their work. You know how to drive this thing or do you just like looking good in it?
Six months.  Eleven days.
Yeah.  I think so.
What is it with you and the space program?
You wouldn't be sitting here if you didn't halfway believe me.
Surprise me.
'The Space Shuttle's Seismic Secret'.  'The Oliver Stone-George Bush Connection'.  Oliver Stone?
Pretty scary, huh?
Holden Caulfield?  <u>Catcher in the</u> <u>Rye</u>?
So what's the question?
I put an ad on a computer bulletin board.  I log on at the library so I can't be traced.
Maybe you better not try... I worked so hard to keep quiet. Like a mouse.  I should have realized.
His obituary was in every paper. But not one of them said he was murdered.
It said in the paper he drowned in a swimming pool.  <u>In Newport</u>.
A water main broke.
I thought you -- Why -- Love ruins everything, doesn't it?
This way.
How come serial killers have two names, but lone gunman assassins have three.  John <u>Wilkes</u> Booth. Mark <u>David</u> Chapman.  Lee <u>Harvey</u> Oswald.
That's the last time you rode, isn't it?  Do you think it was your fault?  Is that why?
Walters was their fall guy.  Blow up a building and blame a nut. Create fear.  Don't you see?  Your father wasn't trying to keep Walters in prison.  He was looking into getting him out.  He didn't believe the official story.
Your father, he was dying.  He was worried about you.  He took your picture out to look at it.  He called you his baby.
Without a love of my own.
It's up.  Love gives you wings. You can fly away from here.
You're welcome.  Where's my partner?
That's ironic.  Because we're here to protect her from you.
I'm not a violent man, Mr. Lowry. Not by nature, anyhow.  But if you hurt Liza in any way, I'll kill you.  Does that seem honorable?
And you feel bad for it?
You already asked me that.  Why do you insist on making me repeat myself?
Jerry's visits to your office. Why do you tolerate them?  Why him?
Walters had nothing to do with your father's murder.
This doesn't make sense.
What do you mean?
Nothing.  I was just making sure. So, who are you?
Don't go home.  And don't go to work.  Either one could be bad.
I'm not sure.  We have no launch protocol; the entry of the passenger is supposed to initiate activation.
What?
He died...  ... in 1972.
Then why haven't you detected any signals?  If, as you claim, there have been thousands, millions of advanced civilizations out there for millions of years then why hasn't one signal gotten through?  It'll take a month or two for the paperwork to go through; you're welcome to stay until then.
Apparently he's genuinely interested in science.  This could be a chance to win him over.
Ellie.
Do you have a minute -- ?
What?
As of three o'clock this afternoon. I submitted my resignation.
... I can't believe they wouldn't take something as basic as our biological needs into account...
We've repeated.  A few minutes ago the message cycled back to page one.
Nice.  Where?
This is how you see the sky?
You want to classify prime numbers?
I don't have the figures in front of me, but yes, that sounds about right.
On that old shortwave?  Maybe on a clear night.  Come on now, under the covers.
That's a beauty, Captain.  Now get some sleep.
I'm sorry I couldn't be there for you, sweetheart.
Small moves, Captain, small moves.
Ellie... this is the way it's been done for billions of years...
The systems integration site.
Mmm.  Look closer.
'Any sufficiently advanced technology...'
It's almost there.  The hardest part is getting someone to sell us the telescope time.
-- I'm moving to Washington.
I'm -- I'm fine.
Look, I'm a reasonable person, and reasonably intelligent.  But this experience went beyond both.  For the first time I had to consider the possibility that intellect, as wonderful as it is, is not the only way of comprehending the universe. That it was too small and inadequate a tool to deal with what it was faced with.
You may not believe this... but there's a part of me that wants more than anything to believe in your God.  To believe that we're all here for a purpose, that all this... means something.  But it's because that part of me wants it so badly that I'm so stubborn about making sure it isn't just self-delusion. Of course I want to know God if there is one... but it has to be real.  Unless I have proof how can I be sure?
Yes.  Very much.
Some of my best friends are scientists.  They're saying the machine is alive.
If you came back... you'd only be four years older -- but over 50 years would have passed on Earth.
Really.
The final countdown.
I'm sorry -- I can't --
What are you so afraid of?
Please --
Don't you understand?  I just have to hold it together -- just until tomorrow --
I do.
I don't have any proof, Palmer.
Have you seen what's happening out there?  The terror, the despair? The world is on fire, Ellie.  People need something they can believe in, something worthy, and you can give it to them!
In other words, God works in mysterious ways...
Have your department make a full report.
Git movin', I said.
Like to oblige you, Arletta, but right off I don't know where to put my hands on 'em.
Here, Mom.
No.
Yeah.
Boss, you don't need reasons to hit me.
I... I... I...
It ain't my fault you don't know how to handle your dogs.
I guess you could say I wasn't thinkin', Captain.
Fasten your flap! All you Newmeats gonna have to shape up fast and hard on this gang. We got rules here an' in order to learn them, you gotta keep your ears open and your mouths shut.
Hey, Tattoo!
Mister Cool Hand here is the soft heart in our Loan Department. Next!
He's been betting his head from the gun. Gotta have kings.
I call.
A cold drink? Okay?
Well, whatta we got here?
Well, you know. Small town, not much to do in the evenings. Mostly it was settling up old scores.
Yeah, those poor old guards need all the help they can get.
That's what you're gonna have to do.
Yeah, I know. But what we gotta do first is stretch that l'il ol' belly of yours -- git it all strained out, in fightin' shape, like a barrage balloon.
Foolin', Hell! I would have eaten that dirt for them. They coulda used my head for a shovel and a my face for a broom... They just never did get a piece of my mind.
I've done enough world-shakin' for a while. You do the rest for me. Send me a postcard about it.
That is one mean lady. Bet her husband spends one day a week shooting milkmen.
He's gonna lose a finger eating eggs like that.
Oh for...
A little homeopathic cure for the willies.
Oh my God!  Help!  HE'S READING A NEWSPAPER!
Okay.  You win.  'Dirty Harry' coming up.
No, dear.  You're at your best with a bag in front of your face.
I wouldn't.  He'll be back.  If you want him.  The cute brutal type with handcuffs.  Very sexy.
I'm the only friend you've got, darling, and I don't intend to stop doing what I think is good for us.
Oh, God, uniforms, more stress. Let her sleep.  It's a self-limiting: she hyperventilates till she passes out, then her breathing goes back to normal, and she wakes up singing like a lark.  We know, don't we, Princess?  Give her a couple of hours.  I know about this.
When he was seventeen.
I never carried a gun!
You get me out first.
I brought a present for the lady, there.  I'm looking for her, to give her the present...
The door was open, swear to God, I'm just looking for her when you come charging up the stairs...
You come and visit.
In jail.
You know I can't do that.
I have no life anymore.  I ruined your life, make me pay for it.
I think this is number three...
Well, let's thank God you and Inspector Goetz are on the case, then.
Would you want to work with us on this?
Oh, my God, no!  I'm a clinical hysteric, with panic syndrome, and anxiety neurosis, agoraphobic, I'm afraid of everything, real and imaginary.  I never leave this apartment now.  Nobody ever comes here.  I just wanted to get your attention.  I write and I used to lecture on these crimes, but... I'm not competent.
Nothing.
<u>He</u> won't.
Because I'm his damned pin-up girl! His, all of them!  They know me. They're in prisons with libraries, they collect clippings, I'm their worthy opponent.  You keep my name out of this.
Hello, Ruben...  So that's that...
So far nothing they test for comes up positive.
You're afraid of him.
You do that one, I don't want it...
Ruben's dead.   So stupid, a cop thing, a crazy kid and a buncha dumb mistakes... I'm sorry... because you and he...
You're exhausted.  Let me get you a brandy.
I've got to go.  I've <u>got</u> to go.
Daryll Lee Cullum?  I don't think so.  If he's escaped we'd have the National Guard, cops'd be crawling through sewers.  You'd have a guard on your front door.
Let me get a little action started here.
Well.  Another time, then.  I'll be all right.  He's not going to attack me; what I' m rally afraid of is all in my own head, Ruben.
I'll get a locksmith.
Yes.  I have to go...
Listen to me.  Is there a gas station nearby?
We've put a tap on Dr. Hudson's phone.  I know you won't mention it.
Who came in after you?
You got that right, Nikko, it's none of your business.
I'm sure she thinks it is.  Aren't you at least interested in which one it is?
Classy madonna.
Nada.  Lemme make the call.
Let's get out of here...
The woman's unstable.  You could wind up with a harassment charge. <u>Anything</u>.  You're like some horny little teenager.
Bunch of Swedish women.  You're too young.
Shut up.
I said you were...
Christ.  How old are you?  You sure you want to be in this line of work?
If this is a first step in kicking me off the case, just tell me, to my face, sir, don't waste time being diplomatic.
Saks.  If he knew you did that! They're all asking me, 'what is she doing,' as it is.
No, she can come in tomorrow... gonna want to know a lot of things...
We were together six years, sir!
No. What about your camera girl? Did she come?
It's about time.
After being bombarded endlessly by road- safety propaganda, it's almost a relief to have found myself in-an actual accident.
What about his wife? The woman doctor? Have you visited her yet?
Maybe I am a little.  James, I've got to leave for the office. Are you going to be all right?
Is he circumcised? Can you imagine what his anus is like? Describe it to me. Would you like to sodomize him? Would you like to put your penis right into his anus, thrust it up his anus? Tell me, describe it to me. Tell me what you would do. How would you kiss him in that car? Describe how you'd reach over and unzip his greasy jeans, then take out his penis. Would you kiss it or suck it right away? Which hand would you hold it in? Have you ever sucked a penis? Do you know what semen tastes like? Have you ever tasted semen? Some semen is saltier than others. Vaughan's semen must be very salty...
It's not here. Maybe the police are still holding it. Their forensic people...
Haven't I? To the airport, if you could.
That's Vaughan. He talked to you at the hospital.
Oh yes. I thought he was a medical photographer, doing some sort of accident research. He wanted every conceivable detail about our crash.
You were the last one I saw just before the accident. Do you remember? We made love.
Are you still involving me in your crash?
I can drive.
You're kidding.
Hard to say.
I think in the spirit of group therapy, it's beneficial for each of us to open ourselves up to the others.
We'll see about adjusting the dosage if that doesn't clear in the next  How are other things going?
I have a going-away gesture for you, too.
Me? Nothing. Tell me more about the job.
I'll talk to her, and to Dad, too.  A few wisely-chosen guilt tactics and they'll be ours.
It'll be fine.
No, no. They've got to be Puglia olives, packed in a light brine with a flavor that doesn't overpower the palate.
That settles it. I'm never leaving.
I ruined your wedding night.
I'm so glad to see you. You can't believe the people in here. They've got patients posing as doctors...
I was thinking either the peach moire or cream damask.
When did you start smoking?
I guess so. I think that's right.
I'm glad.
By color.
What if it's got a pattern?
It's no big deal.   We all compare.
Finally. I was getting tired of watching him try every night.
Enough with the abracadabra.
Good God.
I won't do your portion of kitchen cleanup.
That's where I always go when I get out.
I do.
Michael, I...
Oh, right.     I'm ready.   How do I look?
I saw Paul leaving.    Did you do the dirty deed?
First off, you'll need to go to Target. And, let's see, what should you buy?
List schmist. You'll remember.
Throw pillows, Letty. The sales lady said they're the latest thing.
Out? Are you kidding?     I've got all the fixings here.
You got wine. That's great.
Coming.
You don't have to know all this by Saturday. It took me years.
Always the drugs.
Silly, silly, silly.
What do you want to do?
Just promise me you'll be OK, OK?
You should go.
Maybe you ought to see a doctor.
Can you loan me a 20?
Are you all right?
I think we need to talk about some things.
Of course. Yes. I will.     I do.
I don't mean to hurt you.    I know this is a terrible thing.    And I have really loved you.
I start on Monday.
I think I've heard this speech before.
So, in light of how the parents feel, and the fact the students are doing so well with the substitute, I don't think I can put you back in the classroom just yet.
Believe me, I wish I'd understood what was going on. I've worked really hard to get better.
What does that mean?
Yeah. He delivers the goods on Zammito. If we got what we wanted we'd let his brother go providing he tells us where the Van Gogh and the other paintings are.
Not today.   Where are your friends?
I'm your worst fuckin' nightmare. Now, if you don't want me to keep on hurting you, it's important that I believe you and right now I don't. So tell me, where did they go?
You're calling me on your cell phone, right?
My number's going to show up on his bill!
No thank you.
I'm good.   Really.
I'm not here to negotiate.
You told me that on the phone. What the hell are you doing here? Showing off your communication skills? Go back to your people and tell them when they're serious to put a number on the table.
Yeah -- you do that.
Yeah. Seems Maranzano wants to talk about buying the Merchant Street warehouse.
And?
And nothing.     He's just feeling us out.
Angelo, we live and die by the rules we make. We are men of honor, but honor without respect is a... horse-less carriage.
If you think because you're a women this can't go hard on you, think again.
Because you're the closest.
You want Zero to kill him?
I'm going to kill him myself!
We'll think of something.
Maybe if we gave the tapes back --
Guns.   Can you get them?
I can see that. The man's car you stole. Raphael Ruiz. He's head of the 19th Street gang and one crazy motherfucker. And Frankie Zammito's got the word out he's looking for some French dudes. You're French ain't ya?
Yeah. All set. Tomorrow morning. Ten o'clock. Room 211. Barclay Hotel on River Street. Oh, and due to your recent notoriety and the heat that comes with it, I'm going to have to increase my brokerage fee to twenty five hundred.
Everything.
Everything?
Boy, you must be pissed.
You know why I'm handling it very well? Because you're going to get these guys for me.
No. It's just that the French guy had a gunshot wound on his neck. So, this is a homicide. Are you guys involved in this?
You can use my car.
You know, a little of this, a little of that. I've boosted cars, stole radios, run a few scams. Right now I'm into pick-pocketing.
Yeah, but you did do it.   So let's deal with that.
Hey, it's not your picture on the TV, it's mine. So, try to be cool.
It doesn't matter where we go. Between Zammito and the FBI they'll find us. We have to end this here.
She took everything!    Didn't even leave us cab fare.
I'm not going to leave you.
Pink panther, black panther. Who gives a shit? And I don't remember asking you a God Damn thing, you little turd.
How about getting on your knees and communicating with my dick?
I don't know.     It's gotta be millions.
C'mon, I look more like Elvis than you do.
Okay.   You can be Elvis.
No! You can't have the baseball! You're not entitled to the fuckin' baseball!
Give it to me, Sami.
Fuck me?   Fuck you!
No shit?
You wanna tell him?
Take a nap.
That's how you get to know someone.       Did it hurt when you got it?
Yeah. I'm going home today.    What do you want, Frankie?
It's for you.
Pardon me, but I doubt you can handle her.  My wife was quite a martial arts expert.  Jade Fox killed her.  So you see, this is personal.  Leave her to me.
What's it to you?
Then tell me where Jade Fox is.
Wherever we want.  We'll get rid of anyone in our way.  Even your father.
I owe you nothing.
Yes, you do!  You are still my disciple.
Master... I started learning from you in secret when I was 10.  You enchanted me with the world of Giang Hu.  But once I realized I could surpass you, I became so frightened!  Everything fell apart. I had no one to guide me, no one to learn from.
Long.
Don't bother.
But I have had much practice.  As a child in the West, a platoon lived with us.  They'd let me play with their weapons.  The scabbard is so beautiful.
You're too young to understand.
So I heard.  Congratulations.  It's the most important step in a woman's life, isn't it?
You're not married, are you?
You're probably right.
Do you think so?  Let me tell you a story.
I'll give them to you.
They forced me to marry!
Li Mu Bai has made arrangements. He sent him to Wudan Mountain.
What do I care?  You were never a real friend anyway.  But I wonder, how long could you last as my enemy?
Don't be a sore loser.  Go ahead. Take your pick.  I'll wait.  Go ahead.
It's mine.  It means a lot to me. A barbarian like you wouldn't understand.
It has.  How's business?
It's time for me to leave it behind.
But something is going on at the Yu household.
So I shall avenge my master's death after all.
My job was to get the sword back, without embarassing anyone.  I wasn't about to ruin her life, or her father's.
She's an aristocrat's daughter. She's not one of us.  In any case, it will all be over soon.  You'll kill Fox, and she'll marry.
But Wudan does not accept women.
Just be patient with me, Shu Lien.
All right.  I'll write you an introduction.  Take it to Wudan. Wait there for news from me.
Please, Sir Te, what is it?
When it comes to emotions, even great heroes can be idiots.  Tell me if Li Mu Bai is not more open the next time you see him.  I'll give him an earful!
You know, you sure got a hard-on for a guy that's guilty of zip on paper.  Top Dollar runs Showtime; what's the matter, don't you like adult entertainment?
He was a runner for Top Dollar. Just muscle.
I saw it, too.
I need you to tell me what you remember.  What happened to us?
It's just the dope, don't worry
Does she have a name?
You gotta go now, I bet.
In a better place.  I hope.
You mean you'll, like' dig your way out of the grave?  Euww.
I never forget anything, dickhead. That building was a sweep-and- clear; the bitch was a nuisance with her goddamned petition.  It got a little rowdy... end of story.
Does it hurt?
18k.  Crap.
...necklace... pearls...
Yeah, I know, fatso.  Do us all a favor.  Make Top Dollar smile.
Mmm.  But tonight I can take what is his.
Kill a dead guy?
Move in, guys.
Annette Harrison.
Oh cut the shit, Kathryn.
Sebastian was a pathological liar. I wouldn't believe a word he -
I have his journal.
I know.
Is there a mutual feeling between you two?
Forever.
How do you know I've been with several women?
Several times. I'm not as dumb as I act, you know. When Howard Roark makes love to Dominique Francon... most romantic scene in all of literature.
Gee, with an invitation like that how could a girl refuse.
What? Another letter from your friend?
About what you said today in the stable. I'm not a happy person.
Fine. Friends it is. I can live with that.
How are you today?
I'm not going to speak to you till you realize that you can't intimidate me.
Yes, well unfortunately I can't just switch the "on" button to "off." The sad fact of the matter is that you've unintentionally rubbed off on me.
You truly want to do something to make me happy?
It's not about being happy. You and I can't -
Wait, don't hang up.
"I actually feel good about myself?"
I don't.
Lighten up.
Then what's wrong? I love you Annette. It's not like you have a husband, unless your married to Jesus.
You don't even know me. The fact of the matter is there is some one I love. She's smarter, prettier... you don't even compare to her. The only reason I am here is because she wants us to be exclusive.
I'm sorry about that.
Blaine, if I knew who it was that person wouldn't be alive right now.
Where did you say she's from?
Outstanding.
I was thanking her. Vietnamese is such a beautiful language.
What a loser she must be.  Anyhow, Court's invited me to the Hamptons for Labor Day Weekend.
Haven't you ever practiced with one of your girlfriends?
No.
Why?
It involves your brother. He... took advantage of me.
So, let me get this straight. You came over to our house late last night and he forced intercourse on you.
I look terrible.
No, you were fine.
I do.
I swear on my life, I never said a word to her about you.
I'm pretty sure she did.
One.
Ronald?
Outstanding.
What?
Oh but diddling the therapist's daughter is a challenge?
You don't stand a chance. Even this is out of your league.
I'll think about it...
In English.  I'll fuck your brains out.
I'm working on it.
Loser.
Have you succeeded in your task?
Morning.
With who?
You don't know?  She left thirty minutes ago.
It was... it was like the emotional part outweighed the physical part.
It clearly is why.
Oh come on, Kathryn, it was just a contest.
You wanted an answer to your question.
Ronald?
Will you calm down?
Didn't you hear what I said?
Then I will consider it a declaration of war. One. Two... three.
Like your step-brother Sebastian. I can't believe they didn't expel him after what he did to the school nurse.
I hope I didn't keep you from something.
It's Cecile.
Ronald? That's crazy.
Mrs. Caldwell I think you're misunderstanding something.
Is that so?
I'll do that.
Annette! Annette!
I understand. Good night.
What are you talking about?
Kathryn? Oh Christ, she got to you too?
Oh, you'll remember it some time.
Oh, lots of times.
Are they nice?
I had my breakfast while you were still asleep.
I wonder if you don't resent that in her?
You make me sound like the father in "East Lynne."
I thought Amy was calling. I guess not.
That darn kid. I never in my life expected her to get an A in arithmetic. Math's is a practical science --- if she understands figures, she's well out of her own world of make-believe.
That's the Farren house.
Maybe I'll drop in and see your Mommy.
I'll show you.
Certain wishes do.
It's true.
And this one's for Mrs. Farren.
Why, daddy, you know my friend too!
She's there whenever I call her!
Don't you see her?...Right there, under the tree.
The numbers simply don't mean anything
Of course. And Two is the prince who kneels before her on one knee.
That one's an elm.
It's a warm breath -- warm and strong  warmed by the sunlight that shone on the deer's back in the hot summer; sweet with leaves and mosses.
May I pet the deer?
the ring up to him) What's a mourning ring?
Let me take another look at that ring.
Soon as I finish.
But it was alive  it was fast and strong!
If you were the lady who gave me a ring, my mother says I have to give it back to you.
Return it to me? Indeed you may not. I gave it to you as a present.
A Christmas present. It's been so long since I've had a Christmas present.
The storms have done everything they can to me, I don't hate them. I don't even hear the wind. It blows beyond me. It was on such a night as this that Barbara died.
Yes. Yes, Barbara, I shan't forget.
If that child comes here...if I find her trying to steal your love from me...I'll kill her. Yes, I'll kill her:
Wait a minute. Listen.
My brother has an answer to PMS. A-S-S: Abundant Sperm Syndrome. A man gets sperm build-up, and if his woman isn't givin' it to 'em, he's gotta get it elsewhere.
It's not just in my head.
Nearly four.
Does she have PMS?
What does that have to do with me?
They better. Of course, trouble is, you never know what they'll expect for it. You gotta know what to order, and what you're willing to do. Like if a guy spends a fortune on you, he's gonna feel like you owe him something.
No, did you fuck him?
I think I went in and fell asleep. I guess Gregory walked home and got killed! I blacked out.
Rule one: always wear make-up.
Frida, I'm your friend. I'm not judging you... You didn't sleep with the creep did you?
What the hell is the tampon test?
You have to stop being so self- critical Frida.
Frida, this hair thing is all in your head. You're using it as an excuse not to get close to anyone.
Hey, Carlton's in town -- come out with the three of us.
I still thought it was a purse.
No you don't, believe me.
You fucked Carlton? See I told you he liked you.
Relax. Carlton was torn apart. No way could you have done that. Maybe you saw someone kill him and blocked it out... or...
Yeah, I guess. Mark?
I should call the police. Oh no Peter. Peter is the police!
You're cheating on George? Jennifer, how could you?
You're right. It's just, I can't cover up a murder so George won't know you're cheating.
Check out what I found.
Guess she never found true love.
About Mark? Carlton?
Did I kill a guy named Benito?
You said you're starving. Come on, I can't stand a woman who won't eat.
That's great. Highly original.
Hey, how about a little nightcap?
Come on, didn't all that steak make you thirsty?
I really gotta pee.
You never say that.
I think we should do something with strong female characters...
I'll make a note of that. Put the coverage on my desk.
Uh... yes. Not for us. No woman in jeopardy. Find me Dr. Quinn Medicine Woman. Find me a true story about a crazed killer stalking beautiful women.
I'm trying to stay away from caffeine.
Some decaf then? That was stupid. Obviously you said you were staying away from caffeine as a nice way of blowing me off.
No, she died when I was twelve.
I'm so sorry Peter. Gee, that sure puts my problems in perspective.
My period? No.
What happened?
I just don't know if I should be dating anyone right now.
They're for my cat. I use them to train him not to rip up paper.
They do? Oh no...
Frida? You okay? Look, I think I know what happened to Mark. I want to help. I'm coming over.
Yes, your PMS. Frida I can deal with that.
Maybe we should have children. I don't think I'd kill the father of my child.
Oh, I see... interesting theory.
Let's explore this. What makes you feel you're a werewolf?
And how did you feel when you ate this guy?
Oh my god, what happened?
Looks like it was your only date. Unless you go to his funeral.
No, take it.
You got a dog?
She's my best friend. I gotta be there for her -- no matter how crazy it sounds. I've been in some bad relationships and she's been there for me. She's lonely. If pretending she's a werewolf helps, then more power to her.
We're just trying to figure out what happened.
I don't know, I guess the outfits are cool. And I want a big gun.
Hey, you hear about the chick that came in today? Said some chick bit her at Victoria's Secret. Bitches are outta control these days.
We only live a few blocks apart.
Hard to tell. Looks like he's been cleaned up and he's decomposing as we speak. This case gets weirder by the minute.
What the fuck are you following me for? I'm not a suspect here.
Looks like you need a haircut to me.
Thompson suffered a kind of severe delusion or some damn thing.  Anyway he isnt with us any longer.  The case is yours.  Go through his files. Take what you need.  By the way, hows your mother?
Shes getting better, thanks.  She...
Won't say.  Says he must talk to you.
No.  Have a look.
It must be a closet or something.
No.  I mean...  that isnt necessary.
You know something about me?
You're supposed to be my doctor, right?
Everyone get's one  -  very much like this...  But this one's special.  It will help you understand, everything...
That's easy.  You...
`Cause you know I can do other stuff. I mean,  if you wanted me to talk or...
Don't say a .
Is this dangerous or anything?
Don't worry.  You won't even see her.
No...
Yes, Bob.   Choices... Now the Commerce Department..,
You mean the press conference?  I have a couple of ideas I wanted to share with the country.
You're lint!  You're a flea!  You're a blip!
Nightmare...
Don't call the Vice President!
Well, start by going on television and saying that he's had a mild stroke...
Yes - - and that he ought to be up and around sometime soon.
Is that everybody?
Nobody's got clean kids.
I don't want him caring about his wife! What about the Vice President!
Alan, we still have to control this guy...
Was he a senator? Is he on the Trilateral Commission? Was he in Who's Who In Washington NINE YEARS Reed wrestles him away from the door, as Bob struggles to get free.  I'll destroy him, Alan. I'll shred the bastard!!!
This is undeclared income.
I'm not surprised.  Can we save anywhere?
That'd be great.
Extend things?
At a press conference.
'... It's in the gentle kindness of the family kitchen as we gather together when the sun goes down...'
She hardly ever sees him and it'll be so fast, she won't have a chance to tell.
Fine.
You're spending forty-three million dollars on an ad campaign to...  'Boost consumer confidence in the American auto industry.'
No,  sir.  It's more of a perceptual issue.
They re not my attack dogs.
What do you mean?
No.
I had a feeling.
Oh, sure.  Don't worry about it.
Well...
You weren't in the state legislature.
I don't know.
Home.
Oh, they didn't brief you on that? How sloppy of them.
I don't know.  I hadn't thought it out that far.
Thanks.
It was inspirational.
Looks like we're not going to get a chance to get much done.
... Me, too.
Oh... I lived with a President.  It isn't any fun.
Father Mclntire.   He blessed you at the inauguration.
How did you know we were on this island? Do others know? Will others come?
Leave him.
Well, you managed ta make it here jus' in time fer this case, didn't ya?
SIDDOWN, YOUNG LADY! I DONE YUP A SHIT-LOAD O' FAVOURS AND I AIN'T NEVER YET ASKED FER NOTHIN' IN RETURN! NOW HOW'D YOU LIKE TA SPEND TWO WEEKS UP T'THE VEGETABLE FARM YERSELF? THAT'S WHAT IT'LL BE IF YA DON'T SIDDOWN AN' SHUT THE HELL UP!
Gasparilla?
Captain Rhodes and his Red Coat Bees. They could sting, sister. We know you came up against 'em. We been watchin' you since you landed. Couldn't help. I'm sorry for that. We ain't supposed to be outside. If we was spotted it could....well, it could be the end of everything.
That sounds like a curse to me.
I'm sure that's true, miss. And that's why we're doin' what we're doin'. What's happenin' underground here is just what Lucifer planned for this sinful race o' man. But we're gonna beat Lucifer. We're gonna put an end to what's happenin' here.
There's hundreds of 'em. Right where we landed our boat.
I say we got a boat. Can you get other stuff?
We're hopin' you can show us where ta go, Toby.
They are brutes without feeling. Though I admit that I've requested cremation for myself. Burial is an archaic tradition, even more ridiculous now than it ever was. To say nothing of the...spacing problem...on a small island like this.
You are dying, too.
You better not mess with me, Rhodes. I'd love to serve your balls to those Red Coats for lunch! Think about it!
I'll have somebody's ass for this. I'll have your ass, soldier. I'm not gonna stand here and...
Just....following procedure, sir. They're entitled to burial.
Say Steve, where's your manners?  Here's Mutt's brother and you don't offer him a drink? Want some bourbon?
You know how many demerits we're talking?
At Chet Danburry's house.
Oh come on, Pitts...
I don't know what misguided impulse caused you to pull that ridiculous stunt, Mr. Dalton, but, whatever it was, I hope you've learned your lesson.
Sucking out the marrow doesn't mean getting the bone stuck in your throat, Charles.  You still have responsibilities to yourself and those who care about you.
Every guy that I meet wants me for one thing my body.  You're not like that.
If I find that there are others, Mr. Dalton, they will be expelled and you will remain enrolled.  Stand up.
Oh yeah.  Sure.  Valedictorian, National Merit Scholar
Hey, would you not worry about your precious little necks?  If they catch me, I'll tell them I made it up.  All your asses are safe.  Look, Gloria and Tina didn't come here to listen to us argue. Are we gonna have a meeting or what?
It's not all right.  Come on, Dad
You know,
Chet...
All I'm asking you to do is listen.  "The heavens made a girl named Chris, With hair and skin of gold To touch her would be paradise To kiss her glory untold."
Knox, you are so infuriating!
Chet won't know anything.  We'll sit in back and sneak away as soon as it's over.
"We went to the woods because we wanted to suck all the marrow out of life." Anybody want to read?
Your reprimand made quite an impression I'm sure.
Courtyard?
Again!  Louder!
Use your imagination!  First thing that pops to your mind, even if it's gibberish!
All poetry was acceptable.  The name simply referred to the fact, that to join the organization, you had to be dead.
Okay.
Yeah, you just do everything they say! You'll be in daddy's law firm as sure as I'm standing here.  And you'll be approving loans till you croak.
Screw it all.  I don't give a damn about any of it.
Father, I--
Where is this cave he's talking about?
Oh, so you're that Anderson.
I know that.  What's it got to do with you?
It's my birthday.
Put more into it!
Do you have to quit the play?
And where is our point of arrival?
The one you came up to ask...are we on schedule?
20 hours on the clock. Out and back. Double for overtime.
He did...with a crowbar...you know the rules on a broken contract.
Shut up!
You trying to take over my show Finnegan, that what you trying to do?
Nothing...you want to come, come... you don't...
What's that supposed to mean? You people.
I'm not rich people.
Anti social?
You quit high school, lie about your age, join the navy, and next thing you know, four years are up and you need a way to make a living...
This time, make an exception.
So...If the hull's impregnable why are my feet wet?
I'm flying blind here God damn it!
For juice, I gotta rebuild. That's not fast.
Line it up now, nice and easy...
All you're gonna do is get yourself killed...and for what? Some chick?
Like Mamooli's country...
Hey! Come out here!
She fucked me.
Get the boots.
Jesus, it's freezing!
It's Nick!
Yeah.
Hey! Fuckin' A! Time to roll!!!
Oh, sure... Twice a day.
Not bad fresh, but they don't keep worth a pig's fart.
Yeah?
No?
I got you on this flight, Biederman. Is that right?
Linda... Hey, Linda...
I don't know! I don't know either!
That was nothing. That wasn't anything.
But --
Maybe... I don't know, if you want to talk --
Ah yes. Of course... So few survive.  La creme de la creme... How did you obtain release?
Right here.
So do I.
Yeah.
Oh.
Well, where's he from?
Yeah... I mean so he knows... He doesn't even know.
They bombed last night, right? Didn't they bomb? If they bombed last night, they could bomb tonight. They could be up there right now!
Forget Sal.
What do you mean?
I mean forget Sal... Sal can't take it, Nick.
Merle...
YOU'RE CRAZY!!!... NO WAY!... NOW YOU'RE CRAZY!!! YOU'RE COMPLETELY CRAZY!!!
Fine. She's fine... Merle, what the hell are you doing?
How much? How much do you wanna bet?
That's it. No. No way.
You gotta learn, Vince! You come out here... You got no jacket, you got no pants, you got no knife and you got no boots. You think everyone's gonna take care of you! That's what you always think, but this time you're wrong. This time you're on your own!
You know what I think? There's times I think you're a goddamn faggot!... I fixed you up a million times, Merle!  I fixed him up a million times! I don't know how many times I fixed him up... and nothin' ever happens... Zilch! Zero!... The trouble with you, Merle, no one knows what you're talking about! "This is this"? What does that mean, "this is this"? I mean is that some faggot bullshit, or is that some faggot bullshit!!! And if it isn't, what the hell is it???
Great. Hey. That's great.
Place is great. Really. One great place... Basketball, bowling. You name it. Canasta. Hearts. Lots of guys are making salad bowls. What I'll do is make a salad bowl for you, unless you'd rather have a pencil holder. The pencil holder's neat, I mean --
You didn't get a deer?
But, Nick... Hey, I mean, where would a guy like Merle get money like this?
Phantom Mary?
Like I say, Phantom Mary's pretty weird... Lives alone, lives way out in the middle of nowhere with a cat called Pajamas and a cow called Fred. Well, last week I got a call from Phantom Mary, which in itself was very strange...
One, Vince... you have to understand, doing it with one... would be... like nothing. They're small, see, so if you're smart you get about six or eight. I mean, if you want to have any fun.
Witnesses say some wacko went Judge hunting with a late model.  I got an artist working on a computer composite now.
Jesus.  Sweet Jesus.  We've got trouble.
It was Wade's old partner... Gallagher. He was behind it all.
Put that on your political resume.
We have an antidote that'll retard the aging process.
When you bring in Doucet.
Remember my promise.
That wasn't your plan, was it?
I'm thrilled beyond belief.
Fine.
Kill me if you want.  Hard line me with that 'I ain't got nothing to lose' bullshit.  But you've got plenty to lose 'partner'.  You've got a family.  I'm giving you a chance to see them.  I kept in touch.  She never married. All these years.  Maybe she loves you.  I wouldn't know why.
Not the 'T' word.
Officer Hector Sanchez, Sergeant. Hillside Academy.  Status G-8. Security Clearance 3.  One year Advance Technical Crime Analyst. Weapons Assistant.  FDA Junior Captain, Hollywood division---
Got it.  Ejection seat?
Technothugs.
We don't know that for sure.  We'll have to wait until they move.
Well, I'm sure.  You're a cop.  I'm a cop.  Let's do what cops do.
When you're frozen, you're legally dead, right?
You can't catch this man with a computer.
How then?
GCI.  TM-1.  What language are you talking?
Yes, sir.
So, he's got a thing for prison clothes.
This is the guy that killed my partner.
They always are.
My mom says I'm gonna grow.
Of course I will.
They're just outsiders. They want to see how fine Jabez Stone lives these days. They're waiting for your guests, too --
They are all friends of mine -- from over the mountain.  Welcome! Help yourselves to drinks! Glad you could come! Have a good time.
You think you're so smart, Mrs. Stone. You wanted to be near Jabez. It looked like your big chance tonight, but you're wrong, you can't win him back -- not that way.
All right, darling.
I see you! Riding pretty high, ain't you? Look out you don't fall off.
Howdy, Hank.
Why, of course, Hank -- I've always got time for a neighbor. What's on your mind?
Well -- here's how it is ...Tom Sharp, Eli Higgins and a couple of others been talking to me about -- that new sort of organization -- grange they call it. What you think about it?
Thanks, Jabez -- I really wouldn't need very much ... if you could let me have some seed to start off with enough for spring planting ...
Belle.
Well -- it seems to me -- I remember when you paid me--
But what becomes of our souls?
Don't say that -- I know it is --
Of course. Why man, you have one of the richest farms in the county.  You just go about it the wrong way -- so many men do. Hard work -- well, that's all right for people who don't know how to do anything else. It's all right for people who aren't lucky -- but once you're lucky -- you don't work for other people. You make them work for you.
Oh, you know the old story -- the Hessian wagon train that was ambushed on the way to Saratoga. Some of the gold has been buried under your barn!
Yes, of course, people forgot -- or the men who knew about it died, you know how these things happen.
My time isn't up yet.
Not now! Not now!  -- Let me make up -- let me make up.
Are you willing to give me your son in exchange for an extension of our contract?
Yes -- at midnight.
Yep.
Hold the splint tighter -- it's almost done.  Go on reading, Ma. This man, Job, he had troubles, didn't he?
Who is it?
Do you think I'm grudging it?
Yes -- I had to pay the vet in full. He just wouldn't have treated the horse this time. After all, we can't very well do without a horse.
I will, Mary -- always thought a man could be stronger alone -- seems I've been wrong about that.
Well -- I -- I don't know -- I would pay our debts and well -- maybe get a new bonnet, but -- really -- I think I would live the same.
Tired?
Don't take cold, Jabez.  Come -- it's warm in here.
I'll never get my washing done.
But it's not very becoming to you to have your hands in the suds -- when the Squire and his wife --
But Jabez -- the washing has to be done --
Isn't that your own fault?
Jabez!
That's right, Ma -- we ain't licked yet. A Stone's never licked till he's dead -- that's what Dad used to say, didn't he, Ma?
Wouldn't profit him none.
Make out? We'll do better than that!  I never thought I'd be glad for bad luck, but I am. I never thought I'd be glad of a hail storm at harvest time, but I am! Oh, bless ye the works of the Lord in the hail and the storm and the rain!
You'll be a father any minute now.
What mountain?
Yes, Ma -- I'm ready --
Worried about me! Well, you just stop it!
-- I'm going to try, Mr. Webster.
Goodness, Mr. Webster, I've done nothing but talk about that all through dinner.
Why -- yes -- it's hard to put it into words, Mr. Webster. There's this matter of little Daniel's schooling and the new house -- and well -- there's something else that's wrong -- it gets worse, year after year -- it's like a shadow growing -- I can't really talk about it, even to Ma -- she puts it all on Jabez and I won't stand for that.
You don't have to defend him to me, Mary -- I've been called names myself.
Mary -- what love and trust could do for your husband, you've done. And frankly, in a very few moments, this is going to be no place for a lady.
If it's the British Minister, take him around to the pantry and give him some Madeira --
I'd rather see you on the side of the opposition.
It even kicked back -- once at you, didn't it?
Talk has never proved that question, Mr. Webster!  Cup for cup -- what do you say?
Closer to Japan.  You're fast.
Karl, I know you want him, but the police are probably on their way. Maybe we can convince them it was all a mistake, but not if they hear gunshots! If you lock him in he'll be neutralized -- now do it!  Karl?  Karl!
Okay.
Whoa, whoa, easy man.  I won't hurt you.  Who are you?  What are you looking for?
They invited me to the Xmas party. Who knew?
Whoa, Hans, now you're the cowboy?
If out plan works...the FBI will get rid of it for us.
They're all yours, Al.  Good luck.
Al, what's wrong?  Did something --  -- Oh, God.  You're coming in!  That's it, isn't it?  Christ, Powell, I told you what you're dealing with here --
No, but it's gonna need one hell of a paint job and a shitload of screen doors.  One spotters say you got two with that blast.
Ask the FBI.  They've got the terrorist playbook and they're running it, step by step.
Stand by, Powell.  I gotta check something out.
I'm serious.  Hey, this is my wife... Holly Gennero.
Gene, Jesus, what a bull he is!
Yeah.
Come on, nobody's gonna get hurt. If they were gonna shoot, they'd shoot now.
Take the subway.  We need the car.  Hey, gimme the keys - the keys!
It's okay... it's okay...
He says he doesn't know.  Why don't you cook whatever's there?
Hello, Sonny.
That... huh... they just shoot you with drugs.
Yeah.  So how are you?
I'm sorry...
You're crazy.
You're really crazy.
I know!
Huh ... I don't know.  They got Howard Johnson's there.  I don't know why the fuck I'm going there for.
I know that.  I'm warped... I'm warped!
Oh... wow!  Sonny, you're really into one mess now.
I know I am.  I know!
Sal... Sal... Naturale, oh boy!
I can't survive in prison, Sonny...
Sonny, would you please just tell them... please...
That's great.  Just terrific.  You talk to me with them on the phone, right?  That is really smart.  And, you don't tell me?
Who's on the phone, now?  What do you mean... throw it on you?  You knew it, right?
It's my only chance!
I'm afraid.
You're all one way!  I'm bein' reasonable with you; give me somethin' ... Give me one of them, anyway ... Just one ...
You want me to give up, huh?  Look, Sal's in back with the girls. Anything happens to me - one move - and Sal gives it to them.  Boom boom.  How do I know you won't jump me?
When I'm bein' fucked, I like to be kissed a lot.  Who the fuck are you tryin' to con me into some deal?  You're a city cop, where's the FBI?  This is a federal offense, I got kidnapping, armed robbery, they're gonna bury me!  You know it, you can't talk for them, you're some flunky pig tryin' to bullshit me.  Now God damn it, get somebody in charge here to talk to me!
Okay, what do you give me?
Just one more explosion like that and you're gonna see a dead body ...
Cokes, seven-ups ...  also some aspirin ...
Eugene, at 3:07, this became Federal.  Why don't I take it over now?
Gimme the traveler's checks and the register.
Mulvaney...
What if I take you with me?
Yeah.
Hey.  It's raining.
Did you always call him Junior.
Ah shit.  Okay... go ahead.  Anybody else have to go?
How'd that happen?
But do you mean it?
All right ... send them the guard.
We're not there yet.
Yeah ...
I never been up in a plane before.
Why couldn't he talk about that here?
Oh, Jesus!  Hey.  How about food? I forgot to ask to have food on board.
I've got a jet.  I'll have airport limousine here in a half hour.  I want the hostages.
I want to talk to Leon.
Okay.  Which one goes?
Sonny - Here's your document.
I know you wouldn't need Leon if Heidi was treating you right.  The thing I don't understand is why you come out and sleep with Heidi anyway?  You got two kids on welfare now.  What're you goin' to bed with her, you don't have enough with one wife and two kids on welfare, you want a wife and three kids on welfare?
Not now, Mom, please.
What'll you do?  Come out.
Newsman, not ...
I don't want to be paid.  I'm here with Sal and eight other people ... and we're dyin'!  They're gonna blow our guts out, man!  You're gonna see our brains onna sidewalk! How's that for all you shut-ins and housewives to look at!  You gonna help, or you just put it on instead of AS THE WORLD TURNS?  We're dyin' here!  What have you got for me?
<i>Mr. Bishop... this is Claremont Williams. I own the Williams Brothers armored car service.</i>
<i>Promise me... you won't tell her... that I never fucked Pat Benatar.</i>
<i>The system hasn't been updated.</i>
<i>What happened to them?</i>
Be kind to your sitter.
Why must you fight... everything that is normal? You are blessed with such beauty. Life could be so easy... if only you allowed yourself to fit the mold.
<i>It was the beginning of the end.</i>
Where the fuck do you think you're going?
Yeah. I played base guitar for Pat Benatar.
There are no bond certificates.
SPEAK ENGLISH! JESUS CHRIST WE'RE ON TELEVISION HERE!
They're gonna edit it together out of sequence so it's more exciting. <b> EXT. BEVERLY HILLS -- LATER ON
Is that the only tape you got?
I'm trying to organize a boycott of Sal's pizza joint.  Ya see what I'm saying?
Talk to me.
Jade, you don't know this, but I'm organizing a boycott of Sal's Famous Pizzeria.
Two dollars!  Forget it!
You a troublemaker?
No, are you?  We want some Black people up on the Wall of Fame.
No, you the man.
What was you saying?
I don't know how he does it.
One day you'll be nice to me.  We might both be dead and buried, but you'll be nice.  At least civil.
How old are you?
Wake up!
It's gonna be hot today.
Slavery days are over.  My name ain't Kunta Kinte.  Sis, I don't want to argue, stop pressing me.
What are you so worked up about?
He's completely innocent.
ML, hold this for me.
Can't do.
Here, you gotta delivery.
Where we goin'?
Sal, I want my money.
Before I get off work.
Your memory is really getting bad.
How long then?
Why you gotta curse?
Of course I'm sweating.  I'm burning up.  It's hot, moron, only a hundred degrees in here.
Lie down, please.
Yes, yes, Lord.  Isn't this better than Haagen-Dazs butter pecan ice cream?
I didn't know you could read.
Fuck you.  Anyway, Minister Farrakhan always talks about the so-called "day" when the Black man will rise.  "We will one day rule the earth as we did in our glorious past."  You really believe that shit?
That's what you think?
Vito, get a broom and sweep out front.
I didn't want to come to work anyway.  I hate this freakin' place.
Mookie, you're fucking up.
Since when do you know what's best for us?
Then we could try something else.
We don't know nuthin' else.
Then I'm in. Just like Jerk-Off.
Sleeeeew sheek baw...
Depends how you define 'new'...
Yeah, well, I'd much rather write an expose or a hard hitting investigative piece, but nothing really ever happens around here. But, I chose you and that's fine.  I'm Jessica Matthews.
A field trip? Maybe I'll join you. See you tomorrow.
Would you like something to drink?
Hard for me? Hard for me? Hard for me? Hard for me?  You had questions?
I checked with the school board, she's not an accredited teacher.
That's okay. Lloyd's really the one teaching the class.
Sit down, I have something to tell you.
Just down the hall.
Well la de da.
Well save room for Mrs. Matthews famous baked brisket.
I'm just not ready.
Home school. Til today.
Home school? What's that?
Why not?
Yeah, it's nice. And your friend TURK is totally great.
If he heard you talking like that he'd make you walk the plank.  Three, two, one. Now it's your turn, spin.
A-ha! You landed on Candyland! Now swallow it!
Okay. Anyone else have any questions?
The pilgrim who used penicillin to kill Godzilla.
HARRY, I said don't 'dress like a Queen'!
Our own special bus.
I don't know. I haven't decided yet.
Oh. Sorry. You're right, field trip partner is a big commitment.
Oh yeah, buddy, you're gonna get "some".
Come on, Lloyd. You must know someone I can talk to.
It's really not up to you, Harry. But we just want you to feel like you're part of the decision.
Shut up!
You're always your harshest critic.
Okay, I saw this in a movie once. Open the dining room window and follow my lead. Say what I say.
Don't snap at me like that. You're lucky I don't punch you right in the face.
Me, me, me!
The answer is George Jefferson.
What do you mean? We can't go in there or we'll be "it".
I know I did.
Three words. I did. But you were all mad at me and wouldn't listen.
Yes. Screw George Washington. Just like Marilyn Monroe did.
He's so modest. Probably embarrassed by all the attention.
And with that complete loser
Well, what should we do?
That's not your tape.
I'll talk to you later.
If dou're trying to get in, dou're doo late.
Me too. I'm almost there.
That was fast. Well, did you at least enjoy it?
Okay.
Well he missed a great pot of stew!
Oh yeah, give it to me.
Uh, no and I don't appreciate...turn down here!
You bet I left him, took the dog and we was history.
Yes, it's the big potato. Just have a look at this.
No. No. That's not it. We don't kill him. We don't kill anybody. But I like the way you're thinking. You're focused and you're trying to follow. No, what we need to do is start a fake Special Needs class.
No. No. I heard from Superintendent ZIMMER this morning and evidently he's so impressed with our Special Needs class, he's bringing Richard MOFFIT himself to the Thanksgiving Day parade- check in hand.
Oh, things. Photos. Tapes. I tape everything that goes on in this office.
Sweetheart keep up with me for half a minute. The evidence of every scam we ever pulled. The evidence that's going to put us away for twenty years.
You killed the doctor too soon, you fool!
The carryall will come and lift off the spice harvester. Try and get in close over the harvester... you'll find this interesting Sire. -- The Duke accelerates the ornithopter in the direction of the harvester. Paul can SEE...
Yes?
He will not permit anyone but me to see him. You must be outside this room.... Do what you can.
I am your Truthsayer, my lord...  He is here, my lord.
Oh yes? -- NAVIGATOR Better than those on Richesse.. You are transparent... I see many things... I see plans within plans.
Not in the mood?! Mood's a thing for cattle and love play... not fighting.
I'm sorry Gurney.
No, but many consider my training valuable.
Where are we do you think?
Your suit is fitted desert fashion. Who told you how to do that?
What do you call the mouse shadow in the second moon?
The most lethal poison in the Universe.
Usul... these are fifteen of our fiercest fighters to serve you as your guard... the Fedaykin.
Pain.
Not all of them... I know which ones will.
SILENCE!
Ah, cheer up!   Don't lose heart over what happened tonight.  I predict that your next project will be an outstanding success!
I can't believe this!  <u>I</u> sleep in coffins!
I don't want anything.  I'm just a really big, big fan.  I've seen all your movies.
Take my word for it.  You want to "score" with a young lady, you take her to see "Dracula."
Yeah, it's gonna be a great picture! You'll love your character!  Bunny, Bela's here.  Look, hit the bars, work some parties, and get me transvestites!  <u>I need transvestites</u>!
Oh, like Jekyll and Hyde!  Ah, I've always wanted to play Jekyll and Hyde!  I'm looking forward to this production.
I am always on time.
So let's make another "Dracula." Let's make "The Return of Dracula"!
I never said I could ad-lib...
Okay.  Then you'll be sitting on the <u>left</u>.
Fuck you!  <u>You</u> come out here.  Hey, toss me that J.D.
It'll be wonderful.  We'll be at peace.  In the afterlife, you don't have to worry about finding work.
Formaldehyde.
Bela, they're parasites!  They just want to exploit you.
Uh... you're a very important and respected man.  You're leaving your house... and you're in a hurry to a big social event.
What's to protect?  It was perfect!
These shoes are itchy.
Ah.  The director of "Glen Or Glenda."
I made it up.  It's horseshit!
Cris, you made it.  Thanks a lot.
My pleasure.  I'm always happy to assist in a little larceny.
Ed, it was only one review.
Orson Welles was 26 when he made "Citizen Kane."  I'm already 30!
Huh?!  Oh, uh, no, I didn't get the job. But something <u>better</u> happened!
Boris Karloff!?
It's a shame.  He's such a rest actor, and nobody uses him anymore.
Exactly.
Oh really?  How much money did he put up?
I understand you just moved here?
Hmm.  Those sound kind of small.  Oh, here's one that looks good: Janet Lawton.  I'd sure like to play her.
Well then you should pay him, shouldn't you?
What other sixty-thousand?
Sure thing, Mr. Kravitz.
He's so great, <u>you</u> hire him.
Really?!  Well good for you.
Would that work?
Just, it doesn't look like very much.
Tor!
Hopefully, very soon.  I'm just awaiting the final okay from Mr. Feldman at MGM.
No.  She tink Lobo is waste of my time.  Lobo don't talk.
Don't worry.  You just haven't met right woman yet.  Oopsy.  That cabbage goes right through me.
Nonsense!  You must try our hot glug.
Confidentially, I even paratrooped wearing a brassiere and panties. I'll tell ya, I wasn't scared of being killed, but I was <u>terrified</u> of getting wounded, and having the medics discover my secret.
I know a guy in Universal's stock house -- he's giving me the footage for free.  This movie's gonna look like a million bucks.
Good.  And one more thing.  I think your "Written, Directed, and Starring Ed Wood" credit is a bad idea.
I did.  I established some tits and ass.
How long's he been here?
They're very nice.  Let me get my coat.
A few years ago, I actually saw him do "Dracula" live.  I thought he was much scarier in person.
Huh?
Yes?
Didn't you just make one called "Bride Of The Atom"?
Exactly.  Hey, how 'bout this -- what if I don't have any lines?  I'll do the part mute!
Nah, it'll work.  Where's Bela?
You're <u>sure</u>???
So how long have you known Eddie?
Two people do.  Orson Welles and me.
Wow.
Al!!
Hank was always good with the ladies. Always good-looking. Hell, he's been dead for two days, he still looks better than me.
What?
So if it's a show and they have a guy die that's writing, but if it's real and they have a guy die that's murder.
You know it.
I want you to take this.
And all the kids stared calling me "Pumpkin Ass." "Hey Pumpkin Ass," -- for like a year. So, now, I feel like everyone's watching me and, you know, I'm "Pumpkin Ass" again.
Ed, do you want my advice?
Yeah, that's why I called. I mean, maybe Fed-Ex would tell me where she moved --
Yeah? Well I'm not starting now.
I polled my staff. The men say they'd hang around with him and the women say he's fuckable. And one of the men said he's fuckable.
Thank you. Can I see her?
Just wait here. She's coming right back out.
Tell me.
Right.
Yeah?
No. It's a mess.
I mean, that worked out.
Holy sh--
But what was that whole story about him and a nurse?
What's the difference?
What do you think. I mean about... him. Should I just... have nothing to do with him? I mean...
Mom?
Oh God. What hospital?
I'm sorry. Where'd they send her?
All right, I'11 pay for the parking. Big network!
No, I mean...
I batted!
I hear the dog really liked him.
Cream rinse?
Look, not having been there... I just think you're hurt and you're saying this to, you know, get back at him.
Go!
Saturday, I think we should
What?
I know, I ...
There's a list.
Oh that was... no, I ... she just kind of trapped me into giving her a ride. It's you. I want you.
What?
Come on.
Marcia's living with a singer?
We'd better go...
Next thing you know! Why didn't you stop?
Me?!
Hi.
So you saw me on TV and you said "Hey, let me jump on this."
What?... Why?
Hm?
What is? Oh, dinner!
Mm.
pierdo.
What kind of person?
Thank you.
Fine. You know. We just went to Crossroads.
You have the key, Mr. McAllister.
But, they were there I counted 803 votes.
Should be easy.  So far no competition.
Sure
Good luck, Tracy.
If it's about the posters, I think it's so awful. It's a travesty.
Were you or were you not working in the Watchdog office over the weekend?
I was.  So?  Mr. Pecharda let me in. As you know, with all my responsibilities I often come in on the weekend and have permission to do so. But I left very early, around 6:30.
Why are you lecturing me?
That said, the whole point of an election is to choose winners, and that you have done.  We'll begin with president.
I'm looking at new cars.
Nooo.  I just thought...  l mean, I am looking for a new car.  But I just thought, well, I'm going away soon, and you'll be stuck here and, I don't know, I just think maybe if things had been different we might have been, well, friends. Real friends.  And then things would be different.  Don't you think?
Yeah... whatever.  All I know is she's a troublemaker.  She's on my list.
Thanks. Well. I'm going home now.
Okay.  But is this about the posters?
I'm the one.  I did it.  I tore down Paul's posters.
More this way.
You're there.
It's the only true thing I know anymore.
What do you mean?
For what?
Oh, no, hey.  Like I said. Tammy wouldn't... she...
What do you mean?
Well, see, I was talking to Mr. McAllister about my leg and everything... and how I still want to, you know, do something for the school and --
Good luck to you too, Paul.
Paul, get out!
What'd I do?
How'd you like to make it 1960?  I know the judge and Sergeant Exley here is friends with hte D.A.
It's not what you think.
Why was Susan Lefferts at the Nite Owl?
How'd she meet Patchett?
You want some advice, Miss Bracken?
I'm not sure.
How'd you get to know so much about him?
You gonna tell me what happened with you and Exley?
Him and me both.  <u>Fucking Exley</u>.
Of course... But how?
What work?
Sure, boss.  Sure you can.
We were never properly introduced. Susan and I were fighting that day.  She called him by a nickname.  Muns or Lunts or something.
No!  Please leave!
It's a surprise.  You like surprises, don't you, White?
It wasn't the Negroes.  The Griffith Park report was a phony. And, who says the purple Merc was spotted outside the Nite Owl?
Dudley.
They didn't find the shotguns. They planted them.
What?
With a wrecking ball.  You want to help me swing it?
<u>Lynn</u>.
Jack thought he was up to his neck in all this.
What little studio?
And you fuck people up for a living.  That don't make me you. <u>Capisce</u>, shitbird?
Before Meeks disappeared he was popping off about trying to move eighteen pounds of heroin.
Bullshit.  Where would a two-bit ex-cop get 18 pounds of heroin?
It looks like she was flailing, trying to get away.
But she's moving away from the door.  Who was sitting at this table?
Man, why do you keep asking me that?
Alright.  We'll drop that line for now.  Next topic.  Please comment on Pierce Patchett.
In my car.  Blackmail shit.  The trunk under the carpet.  Patchett got me to photograph a cop fucking this gorgeous cunt Lynn, looks just like Veronicaaa --
You'll make lieutenant inside a year.  Patrol division?
His blood's always up.
Something like that.
What's this all about, lad?
You're playing an angle, college boy.  You're getting something out of this so you don't have to hobnob with the fucking rank and file cops who'll hate your guts for snitching.  If they're making you a detective, watch out.  Some Bureau guys are gonna burn in this and you're gonna have to work with friends of theirs.
Just don't shoot me.
Yesterday yes, today no.  What happened last night?
You should be the last person who wants to dig any deeper into the Nite Owl, <u>Lieutenant</u>.
I got Vincennes in the next room. It's not a good week for cops in general.
Bud White's been here?
Then try talking to my lawyer. Good evening, gentlemen.
I know who you are.  You're the policeman Bud told me about.
I'll take your word for it.
You're the first person to ever call me tough.
You, me and White, huh?
Karen, this is Sid Hudgeons from <u>Hush-Hush</u> magazine.
Contract players at Metro.  You pinch 'em.  I do you up feature in the next issue.  Plus the usual fifty cash.  Tell me, am I fucking Santa Claus?
I like it!  I like it!
How'd you like a little payback? Not to mention a donation to the widows and orphans fund.  Did you know Loew was a swish?
And Reynolds?
Jackie, all I know is what you know.  The man is very rich.  And he's invested in freeway construction so he's gonna get a lot richer.  But that's it. Patchett's what I like to call 'Twilight.'  He ain't queer, he ain't Red, he can't help me in my quest for prime sinuendo.
Sid, cut the crap.  I --
Give me some Narco skinny.  I want to put out an all hop-head issue. Shvartze jazz musicians and movie stars.  Maybe tie it into the Rosenbergs.  You like?
What happened with the kid and Loew?
He's dead.  I was just there. Somebody slit his throat.
This is Sgt. Vincennes. Requesting a name and address on a phone number.  Hollywood zero-one- two-three-nine.
A bootleg...
Oh, I know.  A Fleur-de-Lis party, right?
Yeah.  Me neither.
Be careful, Danny.
Considering the enormous exposure to which you've subjected this firm, I'd think you'd do best to simply answer my questions.
Yes.
The NSA?
Okay.
You drive a black BMW, license plate SRK1339?
Like a LowJack, but two generations ahead of what the police use. It pulses at 230 Giga-Hertz.
Wait. What do I do?
I don't know what that--
What am I gonna do?! I mean, like, for the rest of my <u>life</u>?!
I'll pay you.
They froze your accounts. Get outa my way.
I was worried about my hundred and twenty 'K'.
Look, my wife is understandably--
None of your business.
How'd you have the manpower to--
Where?
They shouldn't have come without calling first.
What if we do a mailing to Congressmen.
The area's wired for surveillance, they'll be <u>looking</u> for those moves.
What if--
They've done it before. Takes maybe two minutes.
What if we just fucked with 'em?
How?
That's fine.
How 'bout Christian Dior?
Witnesses said you were there, but I notice you didn't file a report.
That's 'cause I <u>wasn't</u> there.
You weren't at Harrison's Department Store the night before--
Than why don't you talk to the bus driver?
Not a very good one, but--
Right.
I saw a man die.
I'm sorry.
Who did you work with to get the--
It's not true.
It's not a real picture, Stacy, it's been doctored-up.
Yes.
I opened the present you got me from Harrison's.
The lingerie.
Who?
My suitcase is gone.
I don't believe it is, no.
Oh.
Do you like fish?
Not that much.
I take a straight 15 percent. Brill's fee varies with risk. Perhaps you'd be more comfortable using someone else.
Mr. DePinto? My name's Robert Dean. I'm an attorney with Seth, Silverberg.
All right, look--
Who's doing this?
The IRS contacted me this morning. They say my lifestyle and receipts exceed my income.
For the last four years.
Goddammit, Rachel, you assured me--
You're a moron, you know that?
Yeah.
Mr. Zavitz was involved in an extortion scheme. We believe he passed you sensitive materials, possibly with your knowledge, and we need to--
Otherwise you may have to what?
My shoe?
Who would do that?
Maybe Bellmoth. Maybe the unions. I don't know.
You're firing me.
Bobby--
I don't under--
Where's mom?
Having an adventure. I can't tell you about it right now, but I'll tell you about it soon.
Just be cool.
Bobby--
I don't know!
No, I--
Bobby, you're in way over your head.
Jerry?
Go fuck yourself.
Tell me about it.
Yeah, what's going on?
You remember Daniel Zavitz?
Yeah.
I honestly don't know.
I don't know.
It means who's side are you on?
There was a transfer.
Help from whom?  Christ.
He's clever? He had help?  Oh.
Sir--
And they have the video. That's confirmed.
What about the tape?
This guy's carrying the <u>flag</u> for the damn terrorism bill. You think this is the best time to piss him off?
No thank you.
Yes sir.
I don't want to go back.
He said - be careful.
Be careful?  You mean you - or me? Who?
See what's happening to them - the stars.
No.
Will you please come in?
You don't sew at all!
A woman should never learn to sew, and if she can she should never admit to it.  Close your eyes.
Say you're feeling faint - the sun.
Yes.  Yes.  Absolutely.
No.
I can't move.  I can't get out.
We've got to get you out of here.
What?
There you have me.
You too.  Good luck!
Clifton - your wife - do you think it's appropriate to leave her?
Sorry, what's your point?
No, I'm not thinking clearly - I need a doctor too, to come with me, can I take this vehicle?  I'll pay, of course - and some morphine and  Seventy miles - I can be back here by dusk.
Try to get a second radiator, we'll bury it between here and the Pottery Hill. And a better jack. We planned badly.
Oh Jesus.  Oh Jesus Christ.
What do you want?
Because we're fine here.  I don't know what Mary told you about me, but I don't need company, I don't need to be looked at.
Where've you been?
I can get in the back.
All over?  I kept trying to cover a very modest portion and still failed.  Are you leaving us?  Now's our opportunity to swap war wounds.
Why do I feel if I had your book I would know everything?
I've had a drink.  Fatal.
What?
The rest meant nothing to me.
Off with his head!
Sweetheart, you know we can't go home, there might be a war.
Could I have a cigarette?
Because I'm a nurse.
Why?  Can he lay eggs?
He needn't disturb you.
Me?  He can't.  I'm already disturbed.
Can I ask - my friend, can he come in? Just for a few minutes?
Thank you.  Thank you.
Yes, of course, I'm so sorry. Stupid of me. Hana gets up, upset to have hurt him.
In that case, I suppose we can't charge.
I'm not sewing anything else.
I didn't like that book either. It's all about men.  Too many men. Just like this house.
So I follow the wires?
You get Hardy.
I should go to the house, get breakfast.
I'll always go back to that church.
You saved my life.  I haven't forgotten.  I thought you were very very tall. You seemed to big - a Giant - and I felt like a child who can't keep her balance.
Only we have to go to work.
Does he have to go?
Pardon me?
I was looking forward to this evening.
I'm feeling old.
I insist.  There clearly isn't room for us all, I'm the least able to dig, and I'm not one of the walking wounded. Those are facts.  Besides, if I remain it's the most effective method of persuading my husband to abandon whatever he's doing and rescue us. It's hard to argue with this logic.
No, please.  I shall be absolutely fine. They pass Almsy, who doesn't look up from his book.
I don't recall asking your permission.
He unscrewed the bolts, reset them on rollers, then slid the whole frame away. No more effort than it takes to vacuum a floor.
Listen to me. Whatever you're doing, stop. Pull out.
How about if you try disappearing.
Something of great value, something of such artistic and historic significance that only you could truly appreciate...
It's nothing serious. I'll just run into that building. They'll have some sort of first aid kit.
Damn, I knew I forgot something.
Certainly not mine. Come on.
I'm just curious what sort of security system you'd have in your own house.
In a week.
You don't get the Mask code unless I go.
So the Mask is part of the down payment too. Must be a really big job.
I've got something for you.
What do I need a thief for? I've got the Mask.
Sure, it's only worth 25 million or so, don't bother telling me what you're going to do with it.
You took the Rembrandt, I figured it was a fair trade.
Would you quiet down! Just for a minute?
A parting gift from the Empire.
Sit down, I'll show you how we're going to do it.
You've thought of everything.
There's always a surprise.
For God's sake, the only way I can get from one elevator to the other is to jump.
Packed.
No. You'll see when we get inside.
But that's all behind us now.
Seen one billion, seen them all.
That's because you grew up rich.
What? Another job? Stealing the Eiffel Tower?
I'm not leaving without you.
You should know, when I come back here with the Mask--if anything goes wrong, a detailed description of everything you've done goes to the PRC.
Black of course.
It better be worth it for me.
How the hell I'm supposed to know the damn difference?
It's too soon.
The early bird gets the damn worm.
You change partners, you change the rules.
It's not just art, it's history. Something you Americans don't care about--because you haven't got any.
To yourself, that's where.
You're giving them to me?
I didn't mean for you to leave them in the middle of the floor.  Jesus.  Look at me. What do I have this afternoon?
An ER doctor who spends his days saving lives was the one out of control --
That asshole smashed in my fucking neck!
Yes?
I thought the same thing, right off the bat. That's why we went to see the doctor.  But hunh-uh.  Turns out one's got nothing to do with the other.
It was right up on the PG&E property over there.
A number for the whole group, or for us?
... couldn't take painkillers cause they made me too groggy to take care of my kids.
Yeah.  I know.
If you hadn't used profanity --
I'm sorry about that.  Really.  But --
Jane's the office manager.  She handles payroll and petty cash.  But she leaves early on Fridays.
Out to lunch with the girls.
You wanna know, you gotta hire me back.  I got a lot of bills to pay.
The ones in the box of files.  The box of files?  The one from your office?
I didn't see any medical records in there.
We've got the PG&E fuckers in Hinkley by the balls.  But nobody's getting rich unless we can pin this on the corporate PG&E fuckers in San Francisco.
What do you mean?
They're trying to intimidate us.  Tell them to wait in the conference room.
Is that what you want?
So what are you thinking?
Do you think we'd do better by going to trial?
I'm sorry, are you saying that if this thing goes to trial, it'll be <u>ten years</u> before these plaintiffs see their money?
This isn't doctor's orders.  It's mine.  I'm saying you can't come.
Oh, now don't get all jealous, Ed.  I got a little something for you, too.
The luckiest son of a bitch in the universe, Erin.  The luckiest son of a bitch in history.
How do you know that?
You come to the right place.
The fuck you don't.  No one calls me Pattee. That heavy-breathing sicko that called the other night could've only found out about me from you.  People are dying, Ross.  You got document after document here, right under your nose, that says why, and you haven't said word one about it.  I wanna know how the hell you sleep at night.
With repeated exposure to toxic levels -- God, anything, really -- respiratory disease, liver failure, heart failure, reproductive failure, chronic headaches, bone or organ deterioration -- plus, of course, any type of cancer.
Well, how do I find out what kind of chromium is up in Hinkley?
George!
Yeah, I'm gonna start sleeping here.  Masry & Vititoe, can I -- damn it.  Does anyone know anything about these phones?
I never forget, honey.  I try, real hard. It's just, for some reason, I don't seem to be able to organize things right and -- when it comes to you guys, I end up falling short.
Oh, God, sweetheart, no.  There's nothing on Earth I love more than you.  Nothing.  I promise.
Whose number do you need?
Which number do you want, George?
You got a little girl?
Return 'em.  Maybe you'll get your money back.
Cause I don't even know you.
Yeah, and whose fault is that?
I'm never here.  I gotta leave 'em with this weird sitter all afternoon who costs a fortune and smells like chicken fat.
I'm just saying --
I didn't say that.
I know what they can sleep through, Erin.  I probably know it better than you.
What do you want, a joke?
What?  Beth?  My Beth?
I don't know.  Few days.  Thanks for helping me.  I appreciate it.
Real early.  We're just gonna take your car to get some breakfast.
We'll just be a minute.  Get a little more sleep.
Next week.
Is this a joke?  Did Baxter put you up to this?
No one put me up to anything.  I was just hoping I could ask you a couple questions.
Don't go telling anyone.  It'll ruin my reputation.
Soon, Lord Vader.
We've come this far ... He is our only hope.
The boy is our last hope.
Luke ... you are the only hope.
You're not ready yet.  You still have much to learn.
Growls a reserved greeting.
Everyone's invited, of course.
No, I'm alright.  I'm alright.
I'm sure I'll see you again, too. Keep well.  You'd better chain him until it's over.
Barks his right on!
Howls.
Away put your weapon.  I mean you no harm.
Yeah ...
A great warrior?  Not many on those.  Wars don't make one great.
I'm not looking for a friend. I'm looking for a Jedi Master.
Of course, yes.  But now eat we must.  Good food, I have good food.  Come, come.
Then I'll see you in Hell.
Our destruction?  Who?
Yes ... yes.  That would be a great asset.
With all the meteor activity in this system, it's going to be difficult to spot approaching ships.
The energy shield is down.  We'll be stuck here forever.
Not collapsing, honey.  It's closing!  This is no cave ...
You probably don't.  How could you?  You're so terrified of your own emotions ...
And what are they, pray tell?
And you think you're the one to apply some heat?
Droid of some kind.  I didn't hit it that hard.  It must have had a self-destruct ....
An Imperial probe droid.
They're just trying to see if they can stir something up ... we're safe.
Yes, you do.
Look, sweetheart, I'm not going to have you accusing my friend of ...
I've finished my circle and I haven't picked up any life read- ings.
There isn't enough life on this ice cube to fill a space cruiser. My sentry markers are placed. I'm heading back to the base.
Thanks to you.
That's two you owe me, junior.
No hard feelings?
Not actually .... Our operation is small enough not to be noticed, so you might say we're enterprisers. Most of our trade is, well ... unofficial.
What?
Are the coordinates set?
Oh my, no!
What did you say?!
Size has no meaning.  It matters not.  Look at me.  Judge me by my size do you?
That is why you fail.
My mind fills with so many images.
I see a city in the clouds.
If it must be.  Yes.
What d'you mean, pretending? They are dressing.  Where'd they get those clothes?
And we can watch ...
Humans?
Plissken, slow down the sub. You're overloading the power plant.
C'mon, Snake - it's L.A. Everything's phony, you know that.
Now go get dressed. We have things to do.
I thought he was, but he came back.
Where's Plissken?
You're stalling, Eddie.  Talk, you little gringo!
I'd like to get out but I don't have enough money.
My name is Hershe Hernandez, do you understand, cowboy?
Having second thoughts?
Yeah, I got it.
You're free, Plissken. But if you even so much as break wind on a country road I'll crush you like a bug.
I said pull over.
Sure, Snake. No problem.  You gonna kill me?
Looking to get out.
Long gone. You'll never catch up with him now, Snake.
The what?
The freeway.
Give me the prototype.
Hershe, you were in Cleveland?
I am King, and this is Excalibur, sword of kings from the dawn of time. Who are you, and why do you block the way?
Not a boast, sir, but a curse.  Never have I met my match in joust or duel.
I will not. You must retreat or prove your kingship in the test of arms, under the eyes of God.
The dragon! There...
Guenevere...
What is it my child?
It is like a tree. The roots of the stones spread out across the land and they draw on the thoughts and actions of men. Like sap those human matters course through the stones feeding the stars that are the leaves of the tree. And the stars whisper back to men the future course of events.  But the earth is being torn apart, its metals stolen, and the balance is broken and the lines of power no longer converge. In fact, I nearly didn't make it in one piece.
Is this a dream? Tell me, Merlin!
I have come to claim what is mine, Father.
I recognize you only as my son, no more.
Your mother told you that?
And I offer only this, Father. To commit with passion and pleasure all the evils that you failed to commit, as man and king.
So be it.
We fought and won battles, and now one man defeats all my knights? I will go.
I grant you your wish if you grant Lady Guenevere hers.
No. I meant not to be angry with you, Sir Gahalt. In the idleness that comes with peace gossip has bread its own evil. You merely repeat it. Please, sir, have one of those apples that Lancelot loves, and in that gesture partake of its goodness.
Not you, my husband?
If I am your judge, I cannot be your champion. When I act as your King, I cannot be your husband.
And you cannot love me...
I have kept it.
He has given up.
Twenty days!? The world is that big?
--It must wait, child. These good ladies, for whom I intervened once, will honor me with a meal. I am beholden to them now as I was when they begged my protection.
Why?
Flattery! Do you think I am ignorant of your stupid little games? Preying on you weakness of others. That's your power, a petty evil. Mine is great. Great plans. Impossible dreams. Laughable endings...
Well what's wrong?
What's he doing there? Teaching?
I'm sorry.
In here!
Just five or six people.
No kidding.
Burke.
Well, when I went to get the Thorazine I had him to stay with her and... Oh, I should of known better.
Stimulant? She's higher than a kite right now!
Her condition isn't quite what it seems. Nobody knows the cause of her hyperkinetic behaviour in a child. The Ritalin sems to work to relieve the condition, but we really don't know how or why, frankly. Your daughter's symptoms could be an overreaction to depression- but that's out of my field.
Never.
Well, she let loose quite a string while I was examining her, Mrs. MacNeil.
It's the other way around. The society sent me through med school.
Didn't tell you of what she did?
And how do you go about getting an exorcism?
Well, the first thing I'd do is put them into a time macine and send them back to the sixteenth century.
Since we learned about mental illness, paranoia, schizophrenia. All the things they taught me in Harvard. Mrs. MacNeil since the day I joined the Jesuits, I've never met one priest who has performed an exorcism, not one.
Like her speaking in a language that she's never known or studied.
Yes I did, I'm sorry.
We'll see when we get home okay.
You know, I make the questions and he does the answers.
I don't know
Oh my god, you kidding, me marry Burke Dennings don't be silly, of course not.
Course I like him, I like pizzas to but I'm not gonna marry one.
Oh you did. What did you hear?
I don't know, I just thought.
Well your thinking's not so good.
Why does God let us get tired?
That's an insult, I got a vow of poverty.
Stealing is a sin.
Withering Heights.
Where's Regan?
Who are you?
Merrin! Merrin!
Momma I can take you somewhere to a place where you wouldn't be alone. There'd be people around, you know you won't have to sit here listening to the radio.
Momma, I'm all right, I'm fine, really I am.
I would like you to go quickly over to the resdence Damien, and gather up a cassock for myself, two surplices, a purple stole, and some holy water, and your copy of The Roman Ritual. The Large one. I believe we should begin.
Why?
I think it would be helpful if I gave you some background on the different personalities Regan has manifested. So far, there seems to be three. She's convinced-
The Lord be with you.
Only what I read in the papers.
Exactly. So on the one hand we've got a witchcraft type of murder and a Black Mass style of desecration in the church.
Maybe somebody crazy, someone with a spite against the church, some unconscious rebellion, perhaps.
Incidentally I mention only in passing that I could tell the judge that it was a matter of confession.
I get passes to the best shows in town. Mrs. K though, she gets tired and never likes to go.
I could have you deported, you know that?
Yes.
It's my goddamn car!
Mondays.
Frank.
Get your hand off me.
Jack.
Count it.
I hate your kids, Frank.
It was an accident.
It was no fucking accident, Frank. The little one ...
You got weird kids, Frank.
Because I'm your brother.  Because I care about you. Because sometimes it seems like the most significant relationship in your life is with that goddamn dog of yours.
Uh-uh.  How about you?  You seeing anyone?
You gotta go.
Yeah ... we're gonna paint in the spring. After the rains.  Look good as new.
The hell you don't.
Yeah, and what put him up there?
I been thinking maybe we should make some changes.  I been thinking maybe we should take on a singer.
Frank.  Fuck it.  Okay?
I'm grateful, Frank.  How much? For the singer.
I'll drop the eighths.
You're a fucking alarm clock.
That's it except for the first. We got the Sheraton, the Ambassador, or the Holiday Inn on Sixtieth.  All three-day turns.
I thought we all had separate rooms.
Come on, Jack.  It's not like it's the first time we've bunked together.  It'll be like when we were kids.  Relax.  Enjoy the view.
Yeah.
No! I never hear it!  Maybe.  Sometimes.  I don't know. But I won't let it bother me.
Really.
Yes, really.  I don't want you to be unhappy, Jack.  If you say it's out of tune, it's out of tune.
Dedications.  I came up with the idea on the road. See, every morning the maids drop one of these cards in each room.  The guest fills out the card, leaves it at the front desk, and that night we play it.  Daniels went crazy for the idea.  And that's not all.  Last night, after the nine o'clock, he corners me, right, and starts asking about our availability.  Like he wants to line something up. I think he's got a hard-on for Susie.
I can't make the tenth.
I mean maybe you should check with us before you go off and book us a month in advance.
Twenty-eight years.
Nothing. We get nothing.
What's it for?
No, it's not that.  I ... can't drink from the bottle.  I ... gag.
Yeah, I know.  Me, too.
A few empty tables.  It's cozier. Besides, Mel Torme couldn't fill this place on a Wednesday night.
Doctor's orders.
Look, Nick.  You want us to pack up, we'll pack up.
Blanche.
Uh-huh.  Well, Miss Moran, what is it you'd like to do for us?
It's one of Jack's favorites.
We ran long.
Okay.  I think that's all we need to know.
Uh ... we'll let you know.
What I mean is --
Do I look like I'm naked?
My wife wears a seven.  You don't look like a seven to me.
All right, but make it quick.  Shoes!  What size do you wear?
Nine?
Piece of cake.
Give me that.
I was gonna split it with you guys.
For the kids.  Merry Christmas, you two.  Don't forget.  We leave the twenty-sixth.
Maybe we should just listen to the radio.
Baker's unabridged.
First times. Hey, look at this.
Okay.The Fantasy Inn.
Great.
Wow. You ever see her again?
Huh?
Forget it.
I'm gonna throw up, Frank.  I mean it. Let's drop it for the ten o'clock, okay?
Gotta go.
How come?
You know, I'm feeling a lot of hostility from you.
Right.  In there.
The name's Baker --
Frank works hard.
And you don't?
I suppose.
Not for money. With my mother.
I don't know.  It's hard figuring you two as brothers.  Seems like the hospital might've scrambled the babies somewhere.
It's okay.  Last one.
You're upset.
All I said was you were good.
You were good.
Sure.
Oh.
Coffee?
Yeah... No.
Eddie did.
Okay.  How'd yours go?
Yeah, real fine.  Especially all the casualties.
Jon, he's hooked up to a full-spectrum polygraph. No one has ever beaten --
I don't care -- he's manipulating it.  That bomb has been built and it's out there, somewhere.
Yeah -- me.
Shut up.
I don't know.  Everything's jumbled -- so you're going to have to help me fill in a few blanks.
Like ...
We need to talk.
You want me to tell you it's okay to leave?  Okay, go on!  GO!
Think about it, Eve! Everything he's done recently has been peculiar, right?  He's said and done things your husband would never do ...
Jon, if I'm not there, he will be tipped off.  I'll get rid of Jamie -- but you and I are in this together.
Damn right.
You haven't got a chance in hell of fooling Pollux. Castor drinks, smokes and walks around with a 24-hour hard-on.  He's nothing like you.
Not anymore.
Five seconds.
I won't tell mom if you don't.
Yeah, mom cut me some slack -- but I decided ... I'd like to be here for you.  Here, mom.  You can have it back.  Thanks, though.
Well, I saw you -- Kim.
That's your name, isn't it?
Get rid of them.
Backing you up!  Didn't you track Castor to the Army Street Terminal?
It was confirmed by your personal security code. Nobody knows that code but you!
Are you TRYING to give us away? For somebody with such a big brain, you think awfully small.
There's fun, bro.  Then there's FUN.
Most of the current chiefs -- they must have pretty hefty prices on their heads.
Done.  In fact, I was already plotting about the best way to meet the foreign bureau chiefs.
Wouldn't be the first time -- or would it?
Gone?
... That's great.
Her assistant said you could call her at home after eight.
She's probably just having a fit of nostalgia.  You know, lonely Christmas Eve, call the one that got away, that kind of thing.
Because my gift comes with ten zeroes at the end...
Please, call me Alan. We try to cultivate a casual atmosphere around here...
A broker? Really. And now youre in the tire business?
We did one point seven million in total revenue...
Oh, Im hearing you, Alan. Thats not the problem. The problem is that what you think is yours, is really mine.  And I dont care how low on the totem pole I start, I will get it back...  So do yourself a favor and dont get too attached to that view because sometime soon, maybe very soon, you and your French country antiques, your chintz sofa, and your little play pen are gonna be moving out of that office.
Is this another one of those Sun Tzu Art of War tricks?
Who did?
You know how to make chocolate milk?
Sure.
Try not to be late because kids dont like to be the last one picked up.
Bye...
I dont think so.
She said that?
Pretty much.
Look, maybe Im not as good a consigliere as you are but you have to trust me on this one.  A little flirtations harmless but youre playing with fire here.  The Fidelity Bank and Trust is a tough creditor.  You make a deposit somewhere else, they close your account forever.
Screw the rules.  Im talking about the choice.
Yes...Jack Campbell...
Of course. Jack Campbell. I went to high school with you...you played baseball, right?  Youre doing well...
What the hell are you talking about?  Whats he talking about?
A lucky streak, huh?
You want to talk about regrets, you're talking to the wrong person.
You just said everyone needs something.
Sure it's about you.  But it's about society, too.
Please.  Just tell me whats happening to me. In plain English.  None of that mumbo jumbo...
Because you got to figure it out for yourself.  Are you listening to me?
Figure it out?  Figure what out?!
Youre a nurse?
Look, I dont know whats going on here but I am Senior Vice President of this company.
I mean sales has always been a feeder for M and A, always...
What?
You hear me complaining about that?
I dont know!  Please stop yelling at me!
Jack...dont even start...
Why not?
Funny, Jack.  Im laughing on the inside.
Youre having a bad day, Ill go with you...actually, theres no way in hell youre gettin me back out there...
HEY!
And...?
Look at me like you havent seen me every day for the last twelve years...
Whats in it for me? Where are my Mary Janes?
Sure.  I really like Annie.
Charles Street?  In the Village?  When we were living in Greenwich Village...?  Great times.  Whyd we ever leave?
Ill fix it.  Ill go out right now and get you something.  Ill make it right.
But Im gettin close, right?
Cmon, Jack, you think there arent mornings when I wake up and wonder what the hell Im doing in New Jersey...
No, this is the center of the universe.  If I were living in Roman times, I would live in Rome, where else?  Today, America is the Roman Empire and New York is Rome itself. John Lennon.
Its good to see you...
Dont worry about it, Jack...
Dont get on that plane!
Hello Jack.  You dont have to stop singing on my account...
Where is he?
Of course I did.
I'd like that, too.
Tonight.
So we'll get egg nog.
Hey, kind of giving up Christmas day for my ex-boss here.
I know, I know.  I'm just worried about what <u>he</u> wants... Speaking of which...
I'm sure he's matured since then.
Victor's better at these things.
Three days.  I was worried about you. How are you feeling?
Reed, I'm not talking about Debbie.
He's smart, powerful, successful --
Ben, I don't know if this thing'll change us back or make us worse. I need you to be patient for a little while longe--
Got it, teach.
Put your tiny little mind at ease.
Back on Earth.  Victor's medical facility... We're in quarantine.
No, it's not.  I thought I was done waiting for Reed... We're all in this together now, Ben.
The Center for Disease Control.  If this thing is contagious --
The cloud has fundamentally altered our DNA.
I've never felt better in my life. When do you get off work?
It's not just the money.  I could make money in my sleep.
You remember in school we talked about working together.  That's what I was about to explain...
Sure.
It's too late for him, and soon it'll be too late for all of us.
<u>Ben</u> did this?
<u>I</u> ruined?  With all due respect, I told you to abort --
Never better.
I was talking about us.  Working together.
You always had a way with words.  I should be getting back.
No, I distinctly remember: <u>you</u> walked out <u>my</u> door.  Ergo...
The plants, from space.  Their particles are still charged.  With the right amount of energy, those ions could <u>create</u> the elemental profile of the cosmic storm.
Curing countless diseases, not just ours.
No way to know.  Without more tests, experiments.
Right, of course, the company... But you see, I've come to realize all the accomplishments in the world mean nothing without someone to share them with --
Victor, we <u>can't do anything</u> until the research is ready.
I'm just saying, I know what it's like to lose something you love.  To see it slip away, and know it's never coming back.
For your sake I hope you're right. I'm sorry if that sounds a little skeptical.
Here's the overall Target Area...
Normally not. Unless it's an Arterio-Venous Fistula --
Message to Proteus.
If I were in their place and I'd run out of time, I'd abandon the ship before I grew to dangerous size... and use the few extra minutes to get out the quickest way possible, on my own...
How bad off is he?
Come along, they'll be operating shortly.  See you later, Mike.
They have...  But we've both got the same problem -- lack or control. We can only keep things Miniaturized for exactly sixty minutes. Arter that, everything starts growing back to its original size.
As part of the Crew.
Oh yes, I've heard of you, Doctor.
Why don't you go on. We'll meet you at the Clearance Desk in a few minutes.
It must have been jarred loose during the whirlpool.
Yes, Cora.
They're much smaller than bacteria...
I feel much better now...
What do you mean?
I can't breathe!... I've got to get out!
It's too late now. We must go on.
I'm going to do what I can to save Benes.
You mean Inner Space is endless?
Surgical assassination?! But that means you suspect --
I'm afraid there's only one thing we can do. Call off the mission.
There's no other way. Tie my safety line to the sub.
Let's hope... So far, somebody's tried to sabotage this mission twice.
They can't reduce nuclear fuel. But once the Reactor's Miniaturized -- along with the submarine -- a microscopic particle should emit enough energy to activate it.
We feel great, don't we? Just <great>?!
We're losing pressure in the Flotation Tanks. Check the Manual, right over there.
Was there any damage?
Then don't drift down further.
What do you mean?
May I have your ticket, please?
I am through fucking around! Drop that fucking briefcase!
Is this a fucking joke here?
Certainly -
What?
We stop at Pancakes Hause.
Huh?  Grimsurd looks at his thumb.
I need ...unguent.
Geez. That's more'n I've heard you say all week.
Jezhush.
Except that you were gonna be here at 7:30.
Yeah, you already said that.
Now we had a deal here! A deal's a deal!
IS IT, JERRY?  You ask those three pour souls up in Brainerd if a deal's a deal! Go ahead, ask 'em!
Yah, but that TruCoat -
Yah, but I'm sayin', that TruCoat, you don't get it and you get oxidization problems. It'll cost you a heck of lot more'n five hunnert -
Oh, for Christ's sake, where's my goddamn checkbook. Let's get this over with.
That's wonderful. Mm-mm. It'll change your life, a course.
They can really take over, that's for sure.
You have children?
He's three now. Course, not in that picture.
So he says, 'So I get it, so you think I'm some kinda jerk for askin',' only he doesn't use the word jerk.
Mm.
Uh-huh... A what?
Shep Proudfoot. That's a name.
Chaska.
Can you be any more specific?
No, I - they don't want - they're just s'posed to be dealin' with me, they were real clear.
Yah.
You bet.
You wouldn't have an extra ticket there?
What if - what if sumpn goes wrong?
We're gonna get Mom back for ya, but we gotta play ball. Ya know, that's the deal. Now if Lorraine calls, or Sylvia, you just say that Mom is in Florida with Pearl and Marty...
Well, you can help me. My name's Marge Gunderson -
My father-in-law, he's the owner.
Ma'am, I answered your question.
Ma'am, I answered your question.  I answered the darn - I'm cooperating here, and I...
Yah, it's pretty darned busy here, but that's the way we like it.
But I already got the, it's okay, the loans are in place, I already got the, the what, the -
Yeah, the three hundred and twenty thousand dollars, you got the money last month.
I'm sure they do - ha ha! But I can't read their serial numbers here. So if you could read me -
Shep said you'd be here at 7:30. What gives, man?
Well... I'm goin' ta bed now.
OOOoooh!  His reaction synchronizes with a reaction from the crowd.
Come by at 2:30 and we'll talk about it. If your numbers are right, Stan says its pretty sweet. Stan Grossman.
Now come on here, no way, Wade!  No way!
They want my money, they can deal with me. Otherwise I'm goin' to a professional.  He points at a briefcase.
Nope.
I'd be very surprised if our suspect was from Brainerd.
Gotta eat a breakfast, Marge.  I'll fix ya some eggs.
Aw, Norm.
Oh, geez. It's quarter to eleven.  I hope I dint wake you.
Yah?
Great. What brings ya down - are ya down here on that homicide - if you're allowed, ya know, to discuss that?
Oh, sure, I unnerstand, I didn't mean to -
Yah, sorry, so I was married to Linda Cooksey - ya remember Linda?  She was a year behind us.
Margie Olmstead?
Gustafson's accountant.
Yah.
But we still haven't found Gustafson.
They're real good.
Yah, ya think?
He's at Norstar.
Right, right.
Yes.  We're men.  Men is what we are.
Strangers with this kind of honesty make me go a big rubbery one.
Look at my face.
Yeah, both of us.
He was full of pep.  Must've had his grande latte enema.
Some of it, yes.
Dynamite?
You need to lighten up.
Anyone who might've noticed either died or recovered and never came back.
Really?
You take tuberculosis.  My smoking doesn't go over at all.
Well, technically, I have more of a right to be there than you.  You still have your balls.
I don't know -- am I?
Goodbye.
Please.
Good.
No... no problem.
Uh ... nah.
Well... thanks, anyway.
What do you get out of it?
Have we been talking too long?  Must we change the subject?
Guy or girl?
Why would you get bent if I asked?
Tyler Durden!  Tyler Durden, you fucking freak.  What's going on?  I'm coming over there...
I'm sorry, I...
Give me a minute, Marla, alright... just sixty seconds.
I've done you enough favors.
I deserve that.  Anyway, I've... I've only just realized
What?
Don't ask.
I did, I think.  But, I'm okay... I'm fine...
I star-sixty-nined you.  I never pick up my phone.  What's up?
Yes... it's a test.
What?
Now, find your power animal.
Tyler Durden.
No, supply oxygen?
All gone.
God, it's late.  I should find a hotel...
So, you called me up, because you just wanted to have a drink before you... go find a hotel?
Huh?
Would that be a problem?
Thank you.
No one really knows that they've seen it. But they did.
A nice, big cock.
Surprise me.
Call what off?
Anyone?
Oh, a new riot control grenade...  "...the successful combination of concussive, 3000 foot-candle flash- blasts and simultaneous high-velocity disbursement of...blah, blah, blah..."
She needs an exorcist.  This isn't love.  This is sport-fucking.
Listen... do me a favor... sit here a minute...
Shhhhhh!  I don't know what to make of this, sir, I really don't...
No, what you're feeling is premature enlightenment.
Yeah.  Where you headed?
Fucking sweet.
What should I have told you?
Look...
Hitting bottom isn't a weekend retreat!  It's not a seminar!  You have to forget everything you know, everything you think you know -- about life, about friendship, about you and me.
If the applicant is young, we tell him he's too young.  Old, too old. Fat, too fat.
"Training?"  Tyler...
We're going to have to do something about Marla...
It's okay.  We okay... a little codependent, sure, but...
You took me to the house.
Not an option, for the most obvious of reasons.  You need to get with the program.  Seven minutes.  Let's get out of here.
What?
You need me.
... no, no, no...
Maintenance.
Listen, something is going to happen, something terrible...
Robert Paulson?
We have a deal worked out with Irvine.
It's free to all.
Ain't that something?
I hope you're ready for this.
Then it wasn't just a sign. It was a premonition?
I have to save Eugene!
He probably already knows we're coming.
Taken care of.
That lucky bastard.
Freaked me out so bad I hid in a shopping cart for four hours. 'Course, missed the show...
Who?
Blow me.  Yellow means go, Kimmy.
I thought we were finished with this bullshit.  This is police work, not the psychic Hot Line.
Hopefully the district judge can straighten it all out by Monday morning.
Does she have a cell phone?  A way we can contact her?
Yeah, I hate to love and leave ya, but I've been over this X-Files shit since the sixth season.
Alright miss, calm down.  I just need this lane open.  I need you to pull your vehicle onto the shoulder!
Like I said, it was like I was there. I remember everything.  The sounds of the crashes, the smells, the look on Shaina's face...
Do you remember what triggered it all?
Evan Shaeffer's dead.
I'm not following you --
Who is this guy, anyway?
Hey, I'm a police officer, remember?
I know, honey.  I just --
I love you too, Dad.  Goodnight.
Jeez, Mom, stop trippin'.
He's not a witch.
Doin' somethin' I'm not supposed to.
Thirty-nine.
Alex, on the plane... you must have experienced... some kind of hyper awareness. But here... you're suggesting Tod's death... and maybe our own... will happen because of... an active Presence.
"Intervention?" What are you, God now?!
Dude, get wisdom. We're about to board a seven hour flight. The toilets in coach are barely ventilated closets. What if your body wants that airplane food out of your system and you have to go torque a wicked cable and then right after you walks in Christa or Blake?  You want them to associate with you with that reflexive gag and the watery sting in their eyes?
Billy! I'm gettin' a vision!  You're the next one...
Hey, man, why'd you say that?!
'Cause if you say another word, I'm gonna fuckn' kill ya!
Me, right? That's why you're not saying.
No one's that strong.
Not with us in the fuckin' car!
What kind of raggedy-ass rescue you call this?
What just happened?
Home on my strobe.
This is state-of-the-art firepower.
Where's your stuff?
No.
I've seen worse places.
Fermented fish sauce.
She likes you.  Says you're dinky- dau.
What's that?
Let me see.
Yes.
What... whattaya do?
Sure.  I only sound like forty-year- old in your language.
Huntington Beach, California.
Took bus, most of way.  I knew you would come here.
I do?
You think you are... .
Let's get that tent down!
Sorry, Sir.
Why me?
We don't try to pull out any of our guys if we find them?
Half their air force is our stuff. Captured.
What?
... and then he, uh... took the other one.
POWs?  I don't know.  But either way it'll get that subcommittee off our necks.  Cream?
That's a pretty hairy ride.  Full Colonels are supposed to be above that sort of thing.
Have fun.
Word came down... they wanted an answer.  And they knew the answer they wanted: no POWs.  But it had to look good.  Best effort.  The whole dog-and-pony show.
That depends on you.  Christ, look at you.  I give you this easy duty until I can get you an assignment... all you have to do is eat ice cream and watch soap operas... and you have to make it Rambo's last stand.
There were treating me like a headcase.
You're not.
Yeah.  Big time.
You got it, sir.
Well did you or didn't you?
I'm paying you.
The nails!! Watch the nails!!...  Listen, you still have to eat.
Please... before you go on... let me tawk... okay... We've had a wonderful time together... When we first met, you said this wasn't serious and I shouldn't get serious and then you moved in and we haven't been serious. And I just wanna say that I have no regrets.  None.  And don't wanna have any now so I want ya to be up front with me... I want the truth. If you're seein' somebody else, let me know... You don't have to pour gasoline on yourself and light a match just to break up with me.  Just tell me the truth.
You're calling <u>Lydia</u> in <u>my</u> office. You must think I'm some dope.  You fuckin' bastard... You...  ... stay out all night long...
He's not a moron.
All right... Sorry... I feel indebted to him.
I thought... if... if I can help him in some way... you know?... get him this girl he loves... Then... maybe.... things'll start changing for me... My luck, ya know... Maybe...  Forget it... It's a stupid idea.
Thanks.
No, I... I think we should talk about this.
First of all, let me tell you something -- you don't know shit. Second of all, as far as <u>we</u> go, what time do you need?  What have we been doing here, except <u>time</u>?  Have I ever... ever pressured you!?
Bullshit!  If you're going to hurt me, you hurt me now -- not some long... drawn out hurt that takes weeks of my life because you don't have the balls!
You'd have the option to care for him at home but my advice is it wouldn't be the best thing for him. He needs hospital care. I just thought you could sign the release forms, but the city can do that. I wouldn't feel responsible in any way. There's really nothing you can do. I'm sorry.
Where?  Maybe we can.
Leave me alone...I wanna go...
I... I was just leaving.
They're putting me on film tomorrow.
No, I have to work.
Well, I mean... I don't know you... This has never... I've never won anything and... I don't have a VCR.
Well..um...you get an official membership card...  Just sign that and we'll laminate it right here... Parry?  You want to laminate Miss Sinclair's card?...
My abode... My domicile... My neck of the woods... Hungry?  Breakfast?  A fruit pie perhaps?
I'm the one what?
Take a guess...  <u>Let him guess</u>!!  <u>Tch</u>.
But I need help and <u>they</u> sent you.
Listen... I don't mean to be flippant or to enrage you or anything but... you're an imbecile.  And I'm not The One... I'm not <u>any</u> One...
I don't know.
No..no, it's..I don't know what to say. This is so nice of you...Jack...
I don't need a job. I have a quest.
I take it back - you're fucking deranged... And you're going to get yourself killed trying to get in there!
You're a true <u>friend</u>.
I don't believe in little floating people! THERE IS NO MAGIC!
What?
Bad example. Just trust me. A woman who loves you keeps you going...gives you strength... Makes you feel like you can do anything...
Is that what your girlfriend does for you?
I'm still scared.
I know!
Ha, ha, ha, ha rubbish...now begone...before somebody drops a house on you!...
OWW...MAN...
I don't like... uh...  Polish love stories...  ... I like musicals.
Oh no, I want to.  I've got a hard-on for you the size of Canada... but I don't... want just one night.  I have a confession to make?
Well, lemme play the other side then.
You said.
Serveza yourself!
That's right, hand.
Yeah, great.  Why don't you throw Z's for 19 frames, and then roll a strike on the last ball in the last frame of a losing game? Just wonderful.
I'm not some piece a crap.
Sssh, come on now...  Be a good girl.
I love it.
Bobby, don't talk like that...
But I can't have any. Is that what you mean?
Only what's on the menu...  A Number Two: Plain omelette. It comes with cottage fries and rolls.
I'm sorry, we don't have side orders of toast. I can give you an English muffin or a coffee roll.
Yeah. I want you to hold it between your knees.
No, I'm not...  I'm not.
Thank you...  Oh no, don't put it on there...
Waldnit von Schnechter. Prewar.
No kidding.
Catherine -- she's a pianist. She's working with Carl.
Carl's a fiddler. What's he doing coaching piano?
Robert, I have to tell you something...
It'll be so good for you, and for Daddy, because you know, you've never really...
All right...
We can't all get up and leave, can we? I mean, there are certain needs you have to respond to...
No, thanks...
Yeah. I said a week, and I've overstayed myself...
You were going without saying goodbye?
What have I been doing? Different things, different jobs, here and there. Nothing that interesting.
That's right. Have you anything to suggest?
I have played a few times. Here and there. As a matter of fact, I was once a rehearsal pianist for a Las Vegas musical revue.
I didn't have any.
Then I must have been supplying it.
No, you're very good at it. I'm really impressed.
Some bath oil?
It's direct, anyway, which seems to be difficult for you.
Yes.
Will you shut up for a minute!!  Pull your car out of line.
I don't know where you were, penis envy.
The TV. There's some good things on it, sometimes.
Perhaps...
Well, you have to simply tell me, that's all.
Now she's tellin' me what the fuck to do.
I, umm, came to see you.
I look good, that's it. So what else do you do for these girls?
I got punished, man.
These are the pretty girls you told me to come down for?
C'mon.
Umm, he got dark brownish eyes, he got a nice nose I love his nose. I love his skin. I love his lips, he got a great smile and he got-
Um, yeah I think so.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Your friend must be misinformed.
Nothing.
You live around here?
By the way: what kind of name is Poon?
You mean her.
Sally Ann Cavanaugh. Oh wait, she couldn't work in your office, she's not from around here.
I have no idea.
Nineteen.
They didn't do anything.
Fletch F. Fletch
'Your men' might just be involved in all this.
Not at all, Chief. But next time... no tongue, okay?
Put the gun down, Alan. I'll take care of them.
Arnold Babar. Isn't there a children's book about an elephant named Babar?
Still, it'd an odd name. I don't remember seeing it on the club registry.
I'll bet. Shame about Ed.
Gee, Alan's been looking kind of sick lately. Is he all right?
No, not for sure. When it comes, it comes. You gonna want some shit?
Fletch...
Thought so. What for?
I'm gonna nail the chief. And you can help or --
You don't have a piece of the action?
Doctor Holmes went to get you some smelling salts. He was quite surprised that you fainted.
What?
Velma.
Well, you can forget about that lady friend business, Alan's the most loyal husband a girl could have. He dotes on that bride of his.
You sure did.
You're a drifter, a -- pardon the expression -- beach bum. No one would notice if you disappeared. I've watched you for a couple weeks.
Wouldn't they normally be locked?
Precisely. Are you a good shot?
It'll be a first class-ticket. I'm sure you'll enjoy the ride. I would recommend staying down there at least a year, Mr. Nugent.
You've certainly thought this out, haven't you?
You sure got the hard part.
What do you say, Mr. Nugent? You'll be doing me and my family a great service.
No problem, boss.
That's okay, Lar. I gotta put this on the back burner for a while.
Check every hotel in L.A. Start with the ones near the airport. Yeah. He's about to leave the country with her. Thanks, Lar.
His bride. Cute as a button.
Please.
If I had a nickel for every one of Alan's flyboy buddies who tried to pick me up, I'd be a rich woman.
You were in the war?
Good point.
Oh, listen to me. I've never even been there and look what I say about it. Anyway, I know there'd be nothing for me to do. I don't even know anybody there.
Yeah.
Yeah. My name's not John Ultramalensky and I wasn't at your wedding.
What does all this mean?
Act natural.
Are you telling me my husband is a bigamist???
They'll be back. He had to go in for a urinalysis.
Very good sir.
Muchas gracias.
Sierra del fuego.
I commend him on his choice
She moved out.
Mattress police. There are no tags on the mattress. I'm going to have to take you downtown. Please give me your weapon.
Frank, you look a little peaked. Wanna vomit?
Oh, I hate it when he calls me that.
I will, Frank, I will. Something came up, okay?
How gray?
You're onto something. That's good. What?
All right. Maybe there are some crooked cops involved in all this.
Who? Donnie and Marie?
You know, I've had it up to here with your bullshit. I need a story from you by tomorrow.
You'll have it.
Frieda's boss.
John!
In a minute!
I ain't -- got -- you.
Fag?  Ass?  I'm sorry, is that a joke?
Oh... I have some questions.
I have no answers.  Thanks for the stain.  Find the girl.  In the envelope are tickets to the Dorothy Chandler.  We'll chat again, then.
Nuthin'.
I'm sorry, that's gotta be a pair of tube socks he has down there.
Listen, Queen Collie, I have a code. I never, ever, drop a case.  Besides, I, uh, used all your money to pay my bills, so I kinda owe you.
Hold that thought.  Are we being shot at?
Fucking Australians!  I hate that country, continent, what is it? Don't we do nuclear testing there?
Make eye contact when you say that.
I like.
Let's get her out of here, before she starts a shoot-out.  Drop us at my place.
Scalping to a funeral, you're a pretty sleazy guy.
You didn't ask.  Have you ever thought about mousse?
Ye-ah.
You wish.  Come on, let's get outta here.
Forget it.
Who cares?  I got a case.
Did he just say what I think he said?
You need it.
Shut up, you dummy.  Who did this to you?
Where's my father?  Have you even looked?
Yeah, uh, I got some pretty good leads...
You think you're so hot just because you can get into any club. You think you're so hot, just because you have sex with great- looking women.  You think you're so hot just because you broke the Ensenada tape piracy ring...
'It's booty time, it's booty time, across the U.S.A.  It's booty time...'
Whatever you're getting paid, I can give you twenty, maybe thirty bucks more.
Off what?  Twenty seconds...
An asshole?  A swine?  A ballistic turd?  Pick one.  I never knew what a blessing my accident was until he died and I had to take over the company.  You see the music is irrelevant in this industry.  I'm going to have to ship this 'wick-prick' platinum just so teenage girls can have a compact disc cover to get wet with.
Oh God, please, <u>don't</u>!
I'm running a little late.  You see, I'm having a party at <u>THE</u> Club to introduce the new lead singer for Black Vomit.  Everyone in the industry will be there, including our friend, Don Cleveland.
Accident?  Accident!  You naive pussball, when I realized my life of music could only be a life of music industry.  I <u>cut my fucking</u> <u>ears off</u> so I'd only hear <u>my</u> music. Here, look.
Fucking amazing, huh?  Chevy Nova, you Bensonhurst shit!  Still in La-la land.  Look at us, two rock 'n' roll dicks.  Unfortunately, only one of us is a detective.
Nice getting all those phone calls from you after you hit it big, you Redhook bastard.
I don't take cases with foundations in bullshit.  They are very hard to walk around in.
What?
There's nothing around.  Nobody's holding.
Got a wife named Angie.
I don't know where I'm gonna find a pizza joint open.
What?
Did you ever pick your feet in Poughkeepsie?
You made three sales to your roaches back there.  We had to chase you through all this shit and you tell me you're clean?
Je peux l'ouvrir tout de suite?
J'ai pas confiance en lui.
Sois gentil avec lui.  On ne sait jamais.  Il peut te faire travailler  la tlvision.
Look how gracefully they conceived that arch.  Like a bowstring.  It was built from both ends.  With no support in the middle.  Beautiful.
Mmm.
Fake it.
Names.
This Charnier guy.  He's in shipping?
Strike out, eh?
A piece of ass wouldn't kill me.
Hunh-uh.  Check the bread.  He spreads it like the Russians are in Jersey.
Give who a tail?
A and A, that's all you're interested in -- Arrests and Ass.
Suspicion of what?
I been damn careful up to now.
No, I don't.
Well, I think you do.
So what?
Nicky Moore.  Patty Ryan.  Mary Finelli. These names mean anything to you, asshole?  Julia Sullivan!  She mean anything?  She means something to me!
Just missed Deleon.  Hayes is up in the squad.
Baltimore?
I'd go with you and Chinese take-out over her any time.
Wish you weren't.
So am I.
Hello, Frank.
Are you listening to me?  You're in a world of shit.  An eye witness has you outside the dead girl's apartment.  We got your prints all over the place.  Plus the fucking driver's license, Frank.  You gotta give me something here. Something I can believe.
Frank, this is insane...
Daddy, Daddy, I can't.
WB2YKXB, who've I got?
15-band closes down at night.  During the day you can chew the band with China if you want.
I been Q-ing you all night.  How the hell did you do it?
Huh?
What'd you say your name was?
Frank...Frank Sullivan.
Look pal, I'm just askin' how you...
29-years ago.
1998.
I'm not doing anything.  Look, I don't know what's going on.  But I swear on my life, I"m here at your old desk, on your Ham, in our house, right now...in 1998.
What?
Why?
Tell me.
What it was like when you died in the fire...
Dad...Dad... There's... I need to...
What?  Johnny, what's wrong?
Whatta you mean she's not here?
I do know.  I'm a cop.  This is what I do.
Did you see him?  Do you know who he is?
All right, I'm with you.  I just hope we know what the hell we're doing.
H-hi.
Yeah, I think so...
We got him!  Dad you got him!
Dad, you there?
I talked to him Gordo.  I talked to my Dad.
Huh?
The Ham radio.  That's how come he didn't die in the fire.
Gordo?
Fine.  You know Dr. Schwartz retired last month?
No kidd'n, he musta been pushing 90!
Yeah, long time ago.  I know you?
I look familiar?
Nah, just working the job.
I beg your pardon, I'm not an asshole.  I'm an actor.
Cool it, Andy.
I think it's called "a shower". You might try it sometime.
I can't even remember what day it is, man.
It's Friday the 13th.
Your bed.
You're irresistible.  I lose control.
It's deceiving.
I'm trying.  I'm really trying.
Destroy the evidence, Pronto!
Yes.
Gulp!
Damn you, Shelly!
I just want you to like me.
You're wrong.
My friggin' stepfather and asshole- in-residence.
Now wait a second!  I thought Burt shot you.
I could swear I heard...
It's a damn company executive game, and she's a damn company exec.
Not what...who.  Seems your boyfriend wants people to believe Jason has returned.
All he's asking is for you to check it out.
Tommy, my father is out looking for you right now.  Something happened tonight and he's sure you're responsible.  If he finds you, he'll...
What's it to ya?
No.
I thank you for getting me out. But I gotta finish what I started.
Crystal Lake...where the nightmare began.
Well, Nancy, I'm Paula... remember?  This is Sissy, and we're gonna be right out there all night so nothing can hurt you. Okay?...
No more.
Well, grown-ups think it's funny to be scared.
Yeah, he was gonna check out "things that go bump in the night."
How many times has Jason been reported killed before, Mr. Campbell?
No.  Not here.  Come by my house tonight at eleven.  Don't be late.
The what?
I'm scared.  I'm very scared.
You know he's not...and he's coming for you.
You know what I want.  You know why I need you.
I know everything about you, Diana.
Do you have to ask?
Yeah, she's good, considering. That kid just takes everything in stride.
June the 19th.
So's he and he knows it.
Tell me.
Don't do anything stupid.
I know what it sounds like.
-- Bad?!
-- Miscarriage?!  Who the fuck told you Jessica had a miscarriage?!
I'm sorry to hear that.  A famous man once said -- there is no worse regret then a temptation resisted.
I'm literally going to kill you!
Really?
I'm sure we'll have no problem getting them to party with us...especially with this.
I mean, Lakeview High just closed its doors for good, right?
I packed it. Just for us.
And neither do you. It's up to Rennie to decide what she wants to do.
She doesn't know what she wants. She's never had a stable life.
No, I think it's just the beginning.
Oh, I can see that. You've done a wonderful job of supervising the kids, Miss Van Deusen.
Just felt a little chill.
Since the school is closing anyway, I'm going to write that novel I've been threatening on everybody.
I seem to detect a hint of ingenuousness in your tone.  In other words, level with me.
What is your location?
I heard you weren't coming.
We changed our minds.
Where are they?
Just radio for help, okay???
The window...
Where you're going, mister?
Crosstown.
Isn't she great? What did I tell you? A talent.
Shut up, Elliot.
Tonight you find out what it means to suffer.
Tonight. What's tonight?
That's awful.
There are things that speak to us from the past.
This could be it.
Let's work on it.
Let's work on it.
This could be it.
This could be it.
What about her?
Can he get through it?
The Red Sox
The Red Sox blow a chance to win their first World Series since 1918. You expect me to miss that for an opening night?
It's your best play, Nicky.
They'll lose because they're my team.
I don't drink coffee, Daddy. And this is not what we should be talking about.
I just had breakfast with her. She didn't say a word about this.
Take it yourself. Take a date.
First you tell me.
What's sexy?
I've been looking for you because I want to let you know what's been going on before you read about it in a gossip column.
You smoked because I smoked. We were falling in love, remember? I used to see certain movies only because you had seen them. I wanted to see what you saw.
I'd forgotten that.
That's very lovely actually.
It was an animal thing. No real intimacy.
I never thought of Dr. Wetzel as having a sex life outside the office.
They're always winning. Until they lose.
It's all connected, Pop. It's one life. Baseball is memory. How do fathers and sons show their love? They go to a ball game together. Thirty-five years later, they sit in the kitchen and remember.
I can't find it.
I lost it. I lose everything.
You're Frankie Lazzaro. The gangster from Rhode Island.
It's complicated. It's a whole life. A person doesn't commit an act of violence out of nowhere. There are strong forces at work.
He used to love losers. But the laws of physics changed.
You're out of bullets.
So what happened since? You're worried about this kid who writes these reviews?
To go to the theater. Wears I don't know what. Make-up, padding.
Why?
Because he is so deeply hated by so many people in the business.
Get the hell out of here. I don't want you bringing our food. Send a real waiter.
But I know you, don't I? I seen you on a poster in the theater district. I'll think of your name in just a --
I have excellent long-term memory.
Yes, Peter.
He has -- something. A funny little quality I find --
Elliot wants to kill him with a railroad spike.
A little drastic maybe?
You know what.
Eleven.
No. That is what you get for distracting me.
One more.
I -- I mean it's all right. It doesn't matter.  I'm -- my name is Andrews, Charlie Andrews. I've come from India -- I've read a great deal about you.
Some of it good, I hope.
It was one incident.
I don't know... I'm still searching for a "response."
Perhaps. I've come here to think about it.
My name is Walk-er. And I intend to report it the way it is.
I would rather march.
You should ride the pony. It is not necessary to walk to prove the point.
Oh, yes, you are. It's been two hundred years since an Indian has cocked a snoot at the British Empire and got away with it. And stop calling me Mr. Patel, you're not a junior clerk anymore.
Ahh.
Somehow I expected not.
Yes -- yes. It's just that... in these clothes I'd -- I'd prefer to go by taxi.
...an eye for an eye making the whole world blind.
I'll see what I can do.
This <i>is</i> the most likely location--
No, we've missed something.  We Hoover again.
No, but since there aren't too many <i>live</i> ones tonight either, you won't mind us conducting one further sweep.  If he does not work here, then there should be no other trace of him.  I think you'd better get some people out of bed, Detective.  In the meantime we can re-check his favorite haunt.
Six one.
He's too tall.
If anybody asks, tell them the truth-- your family disowns you.  You are a disappointment, Jerome.
God, you're serious, aren't you?
Listen, I bag this stuff anyway.  It may as well pay my rent.
A day or so.
It's okay, Eugene.
In a corridor.
Where is your head, Jerome?  You're acting like a guilty man.  They won't marry the eyelash to you.  They won't believe that one of their elite navigators could have suckered them for the last five years.
You <i>are</i> a catch.  No doubt she's worried that she would lower the standard of your offspring. Everybody wants to "breed up".  What's wrong with her?
We want him--we were hoping he would get married and have children.  We'd like grandchildren.
I understand.  That's already been taken care of.  Now you appreciate I can only work with the raw material I have at my disposal but for a little extra...I could also attempt to insert sequences associated with enhanced mathematical or musical ability.
I think I could do something  provided you know what you're doing and you can meet the terms.
I hope he's not just a body.
I'd have to bleach my hair.
Why are you inventing problems?  You two are a couple of goddam clones.  You look so right together, I want to double my fee.
I've found him too.
Why would we do that?
They found an eyelash.
What exactly is wrong?
You've never been here?  Let me order for you.
Let's walk.
You remember the '99 Chrysler LeBaron? It's the exact height of the front fender.  Looked right instead of left.
Not so long--just once around the sun.
I'm not doing it.
I heard about you. You work with Miller.
No way. I always do my own work.
Yeah.
I want to take a walk.
Small town, small bank, big money.
Better than old times.
But I got you out. Didn't I, Doc. I did it. I got you out.
But sometimes I cried a lot too.
Nail him first, be careful he doesn't panic and want to shoot somebody. Local police have one car, a rover, shouldn't be in the vicinity at the time we hit unless it's answering an emergency call... if the cop car shows up remember it doesn't have any automatic weapons. Only a shotgun braced on the dashboard. Get into a tight spot, you'll be out of range at forty yards. Then they're down to their side guns.
I just figure the percentages. He wouldn't try a cross until he's got the money.
It isn't another boyfriend, is it?
Sure?
El Paso.
Either we pick it up or else we leave it right here. We got to go one way or another.
Whatever happens it's over.
That's all I want... It's the only thing I have ever wanted.
I'll be ready.
Yeah.
Pull over.
Thanks. Hope you do too.
What about the vault?
Chambers - Reilly. Time lock opens 20 minutes before they start doing business...
Growing -- all of them - every day.  318, you'll be the only ones on the floor.
I kinda doubt it.
Don't you want to go to the airport?
That right?
Did Eric Pake pull her?
Last Sunday afternoon, Eric and two of his boys arrive with Frank and tell me that he's rumbled. Somehow, he's seen the film and was about to shoot his mouth off. They ask me for some whisky and start forcing it down his throat.  I thought they'd just duff him up a bit. Honest.
Oh ay?
What name?
Nicer than most.
Who?
Oh, do you?
Very lucky, I should think. You're drunk!
We're there now.
Especially when I play the lead.
Sure I'm sure.
The girl's name was Doreen. That's all I know.
Well, it's Carter. That's my name,  And her father was my brother. And he was murdered last Sunday. Now get up and get dressed.
Yeah. A bloody funny thing!
Thanks for coming.
Working at Woolworths.
No.
Nice family, are they? Church-goers and all that?
What?
At the Half Moon.
That's what I was wondering.
Yeah. He comes in here a bit.
That's all right, Eric.
Yes, I retained that, Eric.  Do you know a man called Albert Swift, Eric?
Not till I'm dead, Eric.
What for? Protective purposes?
Knock it off, Gerald.
What? And get the clap?
You're bluffing, you bastard!
Your hundred, and another hundred.
That's right.
You had to, yeah.  Why?
They did.
Eh?
It's too...
That's right?
And so they kill the goose.  I, I, I'll...and a fuckin' man, worked all his life has got to...
For some fuckin' "Sell ten thousand and you win the steak knives..."
You build it!
I want to tell you what somebody should do.
Yes...?
How?  Do something to hurt them. Where they live.
Huh.
He would take you on.  Yes.
You have to steal the leads tonight?
You have to go in.  You have to get the leads.
You want me to break into the office tonight and steal the leads?
...they take me, then.  They're going to ask me who were my accomplices.
That's ridiculous.
Why are you doing this to me, Dave. Why are you talking this way to me? I don't understand.  Why are you doing this at all...?
That's none of your fucking business...
In the abstract...
Why?  Why you going to give me five grand?
Do you need five grand?
Is that what I just said?
You need money?  Is that the...
How ya doing?
I'm fine.  You mean the board?  You mean the board...?
I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm fucked on the board.  You.  You see how...I...  I can't...my mind must be in other places. 'Cause I can't do any...
Yes.
Yes.  They are old.
They're ancient.
Yes.  I'm no fucking good.
That's...
Everything I...you know...
He filed half of them, he filed the big one.  All the little ones, I have, I have to go back and...ah, fuck, I got to go out like a fucking schmuck hat in my hand and reclose the...  I mean, talk about a bad streak. That would sap anyone's self confi... I got to go out and reclose all my... Where's the phones?
Down the street.
Were the leads insured?
A waste of time?  Why?
Why? 'Cause they aren't going to find the guy.
No.
Why?  Because they're stupid. "Where were you last night..."
Did they catch...?
I'll be at the restaurant. </pre> </html>
Fuck.  I had them on River Glen.
I didn't...why should I..."Where were you last..." Is anybody listening to me...?  Where's Moss...?  Where...?
Just go to lunch.
Did they get my contracts?
Moss...Who told him?
Are you talking to me?
The people downtown said...
Hey, fella, let's get this done...
And let's put this together.  Okay? Shel?  Say okay.
Get in the goddamn room.
No.  John.  No.  Let's wait, let's back up here, I did...will you please?  Wait a second.  Please.  I didn't "blow" them.  No.  I didn't "blow" them.  No.  One kicked out, one I closed...
...no...
...then what is this "you say" shit, what is that?  What is that...?
The premium leads.  Yes.  I know what they cost.  John.  Because I, I generated the dollar revenue sufficient to buy them.  Nineteen senny-nine, you know what I made? Senny-nine?  Ninety-six thousand dollars.  John?  For Murray... For Mitch...look at the sheets...
They all kick out.  You run in streaks, pal.  Streaks.  I'm... I'm...don't look at the board, look at me.  Shelly Levene.  Anyone. Ask them on Western.  Ask Getz at Homestead.  Go ask Jerry Graff. You know who I am...I NEED A SHOT. I got to get on the fucking board. Ask them.  Ask them.  Ask them who ever picked up a check I was flush. Moss, Jerry Graff, Mitch himself...Those guys lived on the business I brought in.  They lived on it...and so did Murray, John. You were here you'd of benefited from it too.  And now I'm saying this.  Do I want charity?  Do I want pity?  I want sits.  I want leads that don't come right out of a phone book.  Give me a lead hotter than that, I'll go in and close it.  Give me a chance. That's all I want.  I'm going to get up on that fucking board and all I want is a chance.  It's a streak and I'm going to turn it around.  I need your help.
I saw the board.  You've got four...
I can't split them.
I talked to Murray and Mitch an hour ago.  They're coming in, you understand they're a bit upset over this morning's...
Look: I have a lot of things on my mind, they're coming in, alright, they're very upset, I'm trying to make some sense...
It's not impossible.
You can't learn that in an office. Eh?  He's right.  You have to learn it on the streets.  You can't buy that.  You have to live it.
I told the customer that his contracts had gone to the bank.
Well, hadn't it?
That was easy, wasn't it?
He told me my share was twenty-five.
You've got a big mouth, and now I'm going to show you an even bigger one. 
I'm sorry.
Na, fuck the leads, I'm going home.
...Shut up.  Decide who should be dealt with how?  Is that the thing? I come into the fuckin' office today, I get humiliated by some jagoff cop.  I get accused of...I get this shit thrown in my face by you, you geniune shit, because you're top name on the board...
Guess who?
"I want to tell you something, Harriet..."
Like you taught me...
...and you don't remember. 'Cause you weren't around.  That's cold calling.  Walk up to the door.  I don't even know their name.  I'm selling something they don't even want.  You talk about soft sell... before we had a name for it...before we called it anything, we did it.
Well, we'll do that this weekend.
Ray is director of all European sales and services for American Ex...  But I'm saying you haven't had a meal until you've tasted...I was at the Lingks' last...as a matter of fact, what was that service feature you were talking about...?
Go ahead.
Well, Ray was eating at one of his company's men's home in France...the man's French, isn't he?
Twelve-fifteen.
No.  You said the one.  That's why you said we couldn't talk till Kenilworth.
Oh, God...Oh, God...  Jim, excuse me...Ray, I told you, who he is is the senior vice- president American Express.  His family owns 32 per...Over the past years I've sold him...I can't tell you the dollar amount, but quite a lot of land.  I promised five weeks ago that I'd go to the wife's birthday party in Kenilworth tonight.  I have to go.  You understand. They treat me like a member of the family, so I have to go. 
I'm sorry, Jim.  I can't talk now. I'll call you tonight...I'm sorry. I'm coming, Ray. 
I think I'd better stay here for a while.
Jim!  What are you doing here?  Jim Lingk, D. Ray Morton...
I've got to get Ray to O'Hare...  Come on, let's hustle...  John!  Call American Express in Pittsburgh for Mr. Morton, will you, tell them he's on the one o'clock. 
Who did she call?
I told you.
Tell me again.  Your wife.
You tell me again.
What power?
Who's my pal...?  And what are you, Ricky, huh, what are you, Bishop Sheean?  Who the fuck are you, Mr. Slick...?  What are you, friend to the workingman?  Big deal.  Fuck you, you got the memory a fuckin' fly.  I never liked you.
I'm going home.
They didn't get my contracts.
It went down.  I filed it.
Oh.  Oh.  Oh, your "nostalgia" file, they's fine.  No.  Swell. 'Cause I don't have to...
If you don't want it, give it back.
Yes.  Please.  Please.  The police  can be...
Your contract went out to the bank.
Did you like your party?
Oh yes, the very best.
This man informs to the police; this man allows his vengeance to be bought off... No, he is alone.
She couldn't decide.
That scar-faced bastard will find out what we got from the wholesaler. He won't take a dime less than three hundred dollars.
You're not my father!
Tom is right.
These Eye-ties are really crazy when it comes to their wives.
Not for strangers; for my country.
We're making an investment in Havana.
Pentangeli's dead.  He was ambushed by the Rosato Brothers.  Didn't you know that?
I want you to help me, Fredo.
You?  What do you mean you, I thought...
What do you want me to do?
Nowhere, Mike.  I wanted to get a refill.  How about you?
I know they get Pentangeli, that's all I know.
Beautiful.
What?
Why?
I'm supposed to stay in my house.
Kay... Kay...
That's the first time I've seen the lawyer side of you, Tom.  It's not your best side.
He's not the same as when I met him.
If he were, he'd be dead by now. You'd be a widow.  You'd have no problem.
She's gone, Tom.
Two-thirty.  That gives me time to see my boy.
I don't think so.  Unless I'm very wrong...they're already dead. Killed by someone inside...very frightened that they botched it. That's why I am going to disappear in a few minutes, and leave everything to you.
The new government arrested him, held him for a couple of days with a lot of the other casino people, including Roth's brother, Sam.  The American Embassy arranged flights for citizens; I'm not sure, but I think he's somewhere in New York.
I know you do, Tom.  Then I can count on you to help me do the things I have to do.  If not, call Houstan, and become a Vice-President. Take your family and your mistress and move them to Las Vegas.
Your plans are a little different this time.  You skip Miami, and go straight to Geneva.  It's to be deposited to this number.  And it's got to be there by Monday morning, no slip-up.
No questions.
The room has a bug in it.
Yeah, it worked.  Those were great old days.  We was like the Roman Empire.  The Corleone family was like the Roman Empire.
Yeah, it was once.
The committee is adjourned until further notice.
Mr. Ola's just leaving, Kay. Please tell the Senator I won't be a minute.
I'm sorry about some of the people I had to see today.  It was bad timing... but it couldn't be helped.
His brother came to help him.
Kay, you've got it wrong.  That kind of thing's all over, I promised you.  This was between the two brothers.  Years ago Frankie had a young girlfriend; he called her his co-wife.  That was his joke, but he meant it.  He wouldn't divorce his wife... because she was a great cook.  He said he girlfriend made a spaghetti sauce once and it was so terrible he knew he could never marry her.  He set her up in a house in Jersey.  She had to be faithful... and she had to have kids. And she did, two, a boy and a girl. He had her checked out and watched so she couldn't cheat... but the girl couldn't stand that kind of life.  She begged him to let her go. He did.  He gave her money and made her give up the kids.  Then Frankie took them to Italy, and had them brought up by his brother Vincenzo. Where he knew they'd by safe.
Oh, I do feel things for you, Michael; but now, I think it's pity. For the first time since I've known you, you seem so helpless.  You held me a prisoner once; will you try again?
I know what it meant... and I'm prepared to make it up to you.  I will make changes; I can.  I CAN change; that I have learned, that I have the strength to change... And we have another child, a boy... and you'll forget the miscarriage.
But times are different...
What a mistake; people behaving like that, with guns.  It was my understanding we left all that behind.  But, let me tell you, the important thing is that you're all right.  Good health is the most important thing; more than success; more than power; more than money.
My concern is that the three million never arrived at Batista's numbered account in Switzerland. He thinks it's because you have second thoughts about his ability to stop the rebels.
Six million dollars in cash is a high price for a piece of a country in the middle of a revolution.
No, I'm fine.
Very impressive.
How is his health?
Is there anything I can do; anything I can send?
Okay.  You know he doesn't have that kind of money.
That is a complete falsehood.
I want you to settle these troubles with the Rosato Brothers.
Jesus Christ, Michael, then let's hit 'em now, while we still got the muscle.
I trust these men with my life. They are my right arms; I cannot insult them by sending them away.
Are we going to eat or what?
Sure, on me.  I got Diner's Club.
We want Brooklyn one hundred percent.  No more taxes to you.  We want to be only loosely connected with your family -- sort of a under-family all of our own.  Then we can act on all internal matters without talking.  Also we want you to inform Michael Corleone that we can deal directly with him.
My lawyer went over this beforehand.
What was that?
All right, then.  He's interested in you for your conversation.  We know what a great talker you are.
Sure.  I loved it.
You know, I just can't do that anymore.  I still have time to get things right.  Get married again --
What kind of man are you?  Are you a good man?
Gimme a break.  I'm going to sit on my ass while he draws pictures.  Is that going to hurt him?
You do that.
Of course.  I am married still.
No.  I have children, grandchildren too.  I visit when I can.  But now that Mr. Jimmy cannot be left very long, I do not get away much.  Poor Mr. Jimmy.  There is much good in him, but he will suffer the fires of hell.  Very sad.
You're sure of that?
No.  His is the worse.  The unspeakable.  The deed no man can name without shame?
No!
I'm not going to hurt anyone.
It is my job.  I did it when he was happy and it was easy.  It is only fair I do it now when he is ill.  Enough talk.  I must wake up the master.
Oh, Mr. Jimmy.
You are right.  Yes.  We must put him back.
Just that I was in the Marines.
What?  Oh yes.
You know what they say.  If you have to ask --
In my youth, yes, but never in Hollywood.  No, I was merely a director here.
Broke is more like it.
You don't want to draw pictures of me in my birthday suit, right?
It is.  Only the poorest families ever ate it.  We kept ours in a crockery jar.
Did you now?
No.
Proud?  Any jerk with a gun can kill someone.
It will only make you self-conscious.  You'll have to remove your shirt.
You know how it is.  You have to kiss ass just to get a piece of it.
The fucking studio butchered it. It was 1937, Hitler's armies were already massing -- and still the New York bankers stood in line to curry his favor.  Anything to avoid losing the German market.  They cut away the guts and brought in another director to add slapstick. The picture laid an egg, a great expensive bomb.  For which I was blamed.
I don't know.  I guess I like your stories.
Of course I remember.  Do you think I'm so senile --
Exactly.  Cukor was too cheap to hire music.  There's nothing but chin-wag.  The cold dreary custard of English chin-wag.
I thought you'd given up on my picture.
Why not?  Give us something to do while we wait.
But you said --
"A perfect night for mystery and horror.  The air itself is filled with monsters."
I don't recall.  Memories of the war, perhaps.
What'd you say?
It's from the first World War, isn't it?
There are straps in back.
Tomorrow and tomorrow and tomorrow...
I think I'll hang around.
I was, until last night.  Publicity asked me to fly Miss Taylor in for today's reception.
Oh dear.  I'll never work in this town again?
More your line.
Elsa?
Oh shut up.  All we did was talk. My attack had nothing to do with him.
Perhaps we should get you uphill before the pills knock you cold.
No.  Let me lie here.  Thank you.
A visitor.
No.  I expect you can't.
I was born outside London, the only son of a minister who was a master at Harrow.  Grandfather was a bishop.  Church of...Church of Eng...
Your father was a schoolmaster?
I don't mind.
That you were forced to retire because, uh -- a sex scandal.
Take off your vest and I'll tell you a story.
Certainly, Mr. Kay.  Is there anything in particular you want to know?
You didn't?
Don't think that, Mr. Whale.  I love your movies.  That's why I wanted you to come to this.  So I could see you with your monsters.
Is there someplace we can talk?
Six years ...
A boost? What's Kip doing on a boost?
Maybe she don't know. Although I don't see how that could be. Maybe she didn't want to upset you -
Grow up. You don't kill people like me. People like me die in their sleep at 87 ... Do you know why? Because if you did kill me, and everyone knew it was you - for the next ten years they'd be finding pieces of those you love scattered all over California ...
Right there -
Look at it. I can't very well make delivery of that thing ...
Let them go --
You'll leave -- ?
You betcha --
Sure. But sometimes we got to create some numbers. The task force is run by statistics, you know ...
Good.
Very good. Think you can get in without waking her up -- ?
Donny-nothin'!
Okay. Figure it forgotten. What's this about anyways -- ?
And there she is --
We've got several Italian cars on the list. Always tricky, always timeconsuming. So we're gonna need a specialist ...
I think so too --
Pop the trunk. I need my tool ...
It ain't what you'd call a "good sign"
How's Kip?
I knew it. He's changed, Randall. He's a different boy. He's lost that... That sweetness ... It's gone ... And I don't know what to do ...
We do it. He'll get clear Once and for all
I know, sir ...
What do you say, Toby?,
Oh. You maybe have more than one enemy who owns a car-crusher -- ?
Easy ... Take it easy ... We're almost there...
I heard you were pumping gas -
I can see that -
What?
You can handle it?
I can handle it --
I like how you wallop back in here - after four years - and can still get all Clifford Huxtable on my shit ...
I hear ya. Get me outta this. I'll move to the country. Open a fruit stand...
What era was that -- ?
The era when crime didn't pay --
I know. I've missed you, too
I saw her get smashed-up on the TV. Knew there was no way he was gonna accept her ...
You boost her -- ?
Hell, yeah. Ten larger man
A distinction worth noting ...
I'm not doing it anymore. Haven't for a while. I've carved out something for myself. It's pathetic, but it's mine ...
I understand -
I know. But let's prep 'em. We could stay here all night... That wouldn't be good --
Shhh... Car thieves are your weakness.
"Unlock my button" ... ?
Woo-woo-wooooo!
Kip's not clear yet. We got one more to go --
Nothing. Just that if I was less secure, I might think you were more into Eleanor than you are me...
Tell me...
"A people is a detour of nature to get 6 or 7 great men - Yes, and then to get around them..." Nietzsche said that.
No we don't -
So what's in there -- ?
No ... No... No ... Tell me what's gonna happen? Kip? Tell me. What's gonna happen?
I thought you were going to stand me up. You looked bored. You didn't say anything. What did you expect. Tommy was all over me. Right?
Get inside!
Oh that. Don't worry about that. Nobody's gonna steal it.
Son of a bitch.
Jimmy. He'll be okay. He's good for it. Relax.
So what?  Where are they gonna go?
Yeah.
He heard.
Marty, please. Let me talk to him.
Yeah, yeah.
Jesus! You must think I'm dumb. What are you bugging me for? I know what to do!
I gotta go home and get my hat.
He says he's too hot.  He doesn't even know I came here today.  It's like he's crazy. Jimmy.
What kind of person doesn't call?
That fuckin' guinea, Will knows him.
Oh, Morgan!
--or a tail--
Stop crowdin the plate!
Yeah, you're all invited over to Morgan's house for a complementary fish sandwhich.
Oh I'm sure, that's why only one of us has herpes.
Yah, but it's better than this shit. At least you'd make some nice bank.
What? No. This is my mother's house. I don't live with my mother. I just stop by, help out. I'm good like that.
She'll live.  If she starts yelling again I might have to run in real quick and beat her with the stick again but...
I really don't know what to say. Look, I lie to women all the time. That's just my way.  Last week Morgan brought these girls down from Roslindale. I told them I was a cosmonaut. They believed me. But Will's not usually like that--
Yeah, it is.
And so they go around to the front of his truck...and there's another cat on the grille.
All right Morgan, fine. I'll tell you why we're not going to "Kelly's." It's because the take-out bitch is a fuckin' idiot. I'm sorry you like her but she's dumb as a post and she has never got our order right, never once.
So why don't you give me my sandwhich?
Yah, that was different. Management was restructurin'--
What the fuck? I just asked you for a job yesterday!
The fuckin' Trooper was so embarrassed he didn't do anything. The fuckin' guy had been drivin' around in my Uncle's car all night lookin' for the house.
Retainer...
Come now...what do you think I am, a juvinile? You don't got any money on you right now. You think I'm gonna take a check? EXECUTIVE It's fine, John, I can cover the rest.
Hey, I'm the last guy to want to talk about school at the bar. But as long as you're here I want to "seize" the opportunity to ask you a question.
It's like a small figure, hoverin' over me. Gettin' closer.
Which one's your building?
I think so.
It's right.  Take it home with you.
Will, what happened at the Tri-tech meeting?
The least you can do is show me a little appreciation.
--You know how fuckin' easy this is to me? This is a joke!  And I'm sorry you can't do this. I really am. 'Cause if you could I wouldn't be forced to watch you fumble around and fuck it up.
That would be fine.
You too, Gerry.
Oh, what is this? Some kind of staring contest between two kids from the "old neighborhood?"
I won't talk first.
I live right around the corner.
Sean, I really don't think you understand--
Einstein. Had two marriages, both train-wrecks. The guy never saw his kids, one of whom, I think, ended up in an asylum--
--Personal rivalry? I'm not getting back at you.
Look, you took one road and I took another. That's fine.
Now wait a minute--
--And why does he hang out with his friends? Because any one of those kids would come in here and take a bat to your head if he asked them to. It's called loyalty!
--I don't want your trophy and I don't give a shit about it! 'Cause I knew you when!! You and Jack and Tom Sanders. I knew you when you were homesick and pimply-faced and didn't know what side of the bed to piss on!
You're wrong, Sean. I'm where I am today because I was pushed. And because I learned to push myself!
What do you want to do?
Yeah, Morgan. It's a real rarity that we'd be out drinkin'.
Had one, now I'm fucked again.
--you have a quality-- something you were born with, that you have no control over- and you are, in a sense, hiding that by becoming a janitor. And I'm not saying that's wrong. I'm friends with the janitor that works in my building. He's been to my house for dinner. As a matter of fact I did some free consultation for "Mike" -- that's not his real name. That's in my book.
Yeah, I read your book. "Mike" had the same problems as "Chad" the stockbroker.
Do you find it hard to hide the fact that you're gay?
Well, I'm sorry to disappoint you, but I'm married and I have two children.
You're getting defensive, Will.
Sure, how 'bout "still waters run deep"--
Maybe what mea--
Watch your mouth.
Why thank you.
You've never been on a plane.
I know, but the joke's better if I tell it in the first person.
Well, are you going out again?
You ever think about gettin' remarried?
Why not?
Well, I've read you colleagues. Your book was good, Sean.  All those guys were in your platoon?
Do you ever wonder what your life would be like if you never met your wife?
Where were you?
You missed Pudge Fisk's homerun to have a drink with a woman you had never met?
Gerry says the meeting went well.
But you can't give back to them, Will.
You're right, Will. Any man who takes a forty minute train ride so those college kids can come in in the morning and their floors will be clean and their trash cans will be empty is an honorable man.
I used to go with the wrench.
It's not your fault.
Good for you. Congratulations.
I'm gonna travel a little bit, so I don't know where I'll be.
What?
It's Will, the really funny good looking guy you met at the bar?
I was kinda' hopin' to get a "good night laid" but...I'll take a kiss.
All the time. We all live in Southie. I live with three of them now.
You were busy? You know, I really was waiting for you to call me.
You're not going into surgery tomorrow are you?
Why is it important to you? If I inherited all that money, the only thing important to me would be workin' on my swing.
Clearly.
Instead you're going to bust your ass for five years so you can be broke? SKYLAR No, so I can be a doctor.
Like me?
I see "Hot Cross Buns," but okay.
Well all right, Beethoven. He looked at a piano and saw music. The fuckin' guy was deaf when he composed the Ode to Joy. They had to turn him around to take a bow because he couldn't hear the crowd going crazy behind him. Stone deaf. He saw all of that music in his head.
One, because I have a job here and two because I live here--
--some prick from Stanford that your parents will approve of. Then you'll sit around with the rest of the upper crust kids and talk about how you went slummin' too.
I don't want to "save" you. I just want to be with you. I love you. I love you!
Goodbye.
Sure! I was just aimin' to meet up with a couple girls I know.
That don't sound like you, Ma. You never was like that before.
I'll get Rosasharn.
Look at that ol' coffeepot steam!
She got to make it.
What'd he look like again?
Cut me off a hunk a that banana cream, and a cuppa java.
Two and a half cents.
Government.
Anything like work aroun' here?
Ma's shore gonna like it here. She ain't been treated decent for a long time.
Well, I do declare!  I baptized you, son.
Why, you're the preacher!
I got nothin' to preach about no more--that's all. I ain't so sure o' things.
But you wasn't a preacher. A girl was just a girl to you. But to me they was holy vessels. I was savin' their souls.  I ast myself--what *is* this call, the Holy Sperit? Maybe *that's* love. Why, I love everybody so much I'm fit to bust sometimes!  So maybe there ain't no sin an' there ain't no virtue. There's just what people do. Some things folks do is nice, and some ain't so nice. But that's as far as any man's got a right to say.
And you ain't ashamed?
No. They wasn't people to write.
I never heard nothin' about it.
Well, if it ain't Tom Joad. How ya, boy?
Thought you was in jail.
We was outa food. Tonight we had meat. Not much, but we had it. Think Pa's gonna give up his meat on account a other fellas? An' Rosasharn needs milk. Think Ma's gonna starve that baby jus' cause a bunch a fellas is yellin' outside a gate?
Save your strength, lady.  Get goin', buddy. No campin' here.
Sure do.
Oh!
I seen your hands. You been swinging a pick or a sledge--that shines up your hands. I notice little things like that all the time.  Got a trade?
This here's a strike.
Five they're a-gettin' now, an' that's all they're int'rested in. I know exackly what Pa'd say. He'd jus' say it wasn't none a his business.
Ain't a-goin', thas all...
Take her with you!
No longer'n we can get acrost her.
Got any plants?
No plants.
Well, you just turn around and walk the other way.
Not tonight you can't. Want to walk back?--or you want me to whistle up some help and take you back?
You git. Go on now, git. You ain't doin' no good. They ain't enough for you.
Sometimes I'm all jumpy inside.
Well, can't nobody get through nine *months* without sorrow.
No. No, it don't. I can't do that. I can't let m'self. All I can do is see how soon they gonna wanta eat again. They'd all get upset if I done anymore 'n that. They all depen' on me jus' thinkin' about that.  That's my part--that an' keepin' the fambly together.
Pa! Shh!
Didn' you get no sleep?
An' that's why you didn't want 'em to look?
You gotta keep clear, Tom. The fambly's breakin' up. You *got* to keep clear.
It's awright, Tommy. I wisht you didn't do it, but you done what you had to do. I can't read no fault in you.
Girl with a baby *always* gets prettier.
I'd like to stay. I'd like to be with ya--  --an' see your face when you an' Pa get settled in a nice little place. I sure wish I could see you then. But--  --I guess I won't never be able to do that. Not now.
They gonna drive me anyways. Soon or later they'll get me, for one thing if not another. Until then...
Sure. Good-by.
Muley! Where's my folks, Muley?
Are you crazy?
Now don't go blaming me. It ain't *my* fault.
How's Granma since we got her in the tent?
Aw, sure. This here's jus' a part of it. Ain't no sense a gettin' scairt right off.
Well, I reckon you *stan'* in them little rooms--an' water come down outa that there little jigger up there--take a bath!
I'm Martin Blank.
I'm Dan. Dan Koretzky.
I sell BMW's. What do you do?
What?
It seemed like my life was slipping away, somehow. I was a knot in the middle of a wet rope. Everything was futile and nothing had value.
That's it?
What's your business?
I don't know exactly. I could venture a guess but it would sound like a rationalization... I thought you know... maybe seeing you, some friends, my house... of course now a 7-11--
We haven't seen each other since high school.
Okay... Would you rather... commit yourself sexually to a four-by-nine cell with former President George Herbert Walker Bush dressed as a super-model for a month, or make love to a otter on crank for a week?
Okay, then. Clearly candied Diller.
A sociopath kills for no reason. I kill for money.
Will you come with me?
I'll hide.
You know where I live?
Maybe some of the discomfort you're feeling is... guilt. Remorse. Over the innocent people you've killed.
I work alone.
Don't listen to him, he's a professional.
--Yes. And the Munich Olympics in '72. A local radio station started broadcasting news of the massacre two minutes before it happened.
Why don't we just do his job then, so we can do our job, and get the fuck out of here.
No...
Tedious. I now authorize you to throw away all personal mail.
Yes. It's the same as usual. Nothing remarkable about it at all.
I spoke to your father the other day.
Nature made him then broke the mold.
You too.
Kind of crept up on you, didn't it?
I freaked out, joined the Army, worked for the government, and went into business for myself... I'm a professional killer.
How could you put your hard-earned dollars into the hands of the class bully?
I have to get my head back into my work.
I'm a professional killer.
Ma'am, I'm very sorry about your problems and I appreciate what your daughter must be going through, but I'm afraid you've misunderstood whatever it is you read. I don't do that sort of thing.
Well, that'll be a little complicated --
Don't be so sure it's my last. There are a few people back home I'd like to put under a red hot iron.
Ha... if you've never lived in a city with museums, theater, music, restaurants, uh... god, a million things, then it's something I can't explain.
Poor thing.
Feel good?
Yeah. I haven't seen him in a while. He used to come to the ranch over summers, but then he started having friends and was going off to college, so... Good boy. Hal. Lives in New York near his mom.
I'm not coming back! That's it! I want to go home!
Grace, listen to me. Your body is just healing. You have to give the rest of you time as well...
Doesn't matter.
I don't care.
Oh. You didn't tell me.
You were never thirteen, Mom.
I didn't see it.
Mom, they don't mind eating with one fork.
You... not wanting to go home because you hate daddy so much.
So special. Because I was the only one. You both wanted me to be so good at everything, so perfect and I wasn't. I was just me. And now I've completely ruined everything, anyway...
How's everything?
Hi.
No, it's got a little left. They'll be in to change it.
Tch. What are you --
Okay.
It's on the table by the phone. I didn't know what to tell him...  ... Whether or not we were...  ... if we still we're thinking of redoing the couch.
Doing what?
Helping all the time! Running to her every time she trips or falls... Anticipating her all the time.
No.
You've already made arrangements!?
Well then... maybe I will take some time... come visit.
I wish I did.
Probably first thing in the morning. It's too late to start now. I'm going to try not to do too much driving in the dark.
What do you mean?
What do you mean?
Well, I know Peterson's. Old place is as good as falling down around your ears.
She calls him Tommy...
You don't seem to upset?
I already know the way... and it's not like I have a job I have to rush home for.  Between you and me, I could use the time alone.
... I just don't know right now! Do whatever you can and when Grace is --
Probably best. You may want to shoot yourself half way to Ohio.
What?
Diane!
We should be fine, then.
Our daddy raised Pure Herefords.
Probably. She's on the phone twenty- three hours a day.
I don't know if I can.
Not a question of if you can -- you are. Just keep your eyes on the road and your foot on the pedal and the rest will take care of yourself.
No!
You want to go to a movie tonight?
I'm okay... I'm okay.
Can we show him Pilgrim, Tom?
I did. He said he had work to do until late.
How much longer do you think?
I understand...
If it's not too much trouble, I thought I might.
Honey... I was always good.
Good. Good man. Alright, let's finish up here, and take him in for interrogation.
...IF it weren't run by a bunch of profiteering gluttons!
Oh yeah, you want a seriously righteous hack, you score one of those Gibsons man. You know, supercomputers they use to like, do physics, and look for oil and stuff?
Difficulty rating?
Never send a boy to do a woman's job. With me, we can do it in seven.
And what's he do?
Never heard of you. Done anything?
You what?
What?
Wanna go for a swim?
Right, well my BLT drive on my computer just went AWOL, and I've got this big project due tomorrow for Mr. Kawasaki, and if I don't get it in, he's gonna ask me to commit Hari Kari...
Yeah, I'm sorry, I was just looking for the principal's office.
What's up, man? I'm the Phreak!
What's happening?
Cancer?
The System Command Processor, it's the brain.
Nono, it's like hot or something. I don't know.
I'm freaking! Joey wasn't making it up! He really hacked into Ellingson! He gave me the disc with a file he copied and now I'm in jail! They're charging me with some serious shit! And there's stuff I didn't even do, like inserting some virus called Da Vinci, and they keep asking about you guys.
Well luckily, you have a gifted and talented security officer. I traced the hacker's call. The secret service picked him up this morning. I'll just search his files for the original virus code, and then I can eliminate it.
I had to move fast. The hacker copied my garbage file.
From here I got access to every piece of data ever stored on Dade Murphy's parents. His parents separated five years ago, reconciled two years later, filed for divorce last year, custody battle, boy chose to go with his mother. Hmm.
Hello, operator? I'm having trouble dialing a number.
Just one moment.
You do? Okay. Go down aisle A. We've got the best costumes in the whole town.
Its about tonight.
So?
What's going on?
She's not dead!
We're trapped in this house.
Brady!
Get up there Rachel!
Look, even if by some miracle Michael is conscience, his muscles would be totally useless.  Give the troopers a chance to search.
We should call the fire department.
How many bodies did you find?
Has he been prepped?
Looks to me like your out of business. Now I want some answers.
Oh, serious questions tonight.  Of course I love you.
Jamie, sometimes it's...
It's been eleven months.
I'm sorry I ruined everything. If I wasn't here you could go out.
I don't want to.
I wanna go trick-or-treating like the other kids.
Yeah, hurry up.
No.
Well try dammit!
Oh no you can't. I've just been there. That's the first place he'll look for you. Where's the school house? Where is the school house?
Wise up to what men want Rachel, or Brady won't be the last man you lose to another woman.
You won't come on too strong.
Jamie?
Okay, bye.
If you'd seen that police station you wouldn't even ask.
He's here, Sheriff.
Myers has been locked up since before she was born. He's never laid eyes on her.
He's been here.
It isn't a man.
Evil.
Sort of.
Your hunting it, ain't ya? Yeah, your hunting it all right, just like me.
What are you hunting, Mr. Sayer?
The only things missing were some Halloween masks, rope, a set of knives. What does that sound like to you?
Huh?
He shouts, too.
Come on, Annie. Bob and I have been planning on it all week.
I have a place for that.
Terrific. I've got three choices. Watch the kid sleep, listen to Lynda screw, or talk to you.
Okay. Bye.
Annie, was that you?
Of course.
Thanks.
What's this big, big news?
Yes, you can.
He went out drinking beer with Mike Godfrey and he won't be back until late. YOU'LL have to call him tomorrow. Besides, I'm on my way to pick up Paul.
I don't know.
Is that all you say?
Go get me a beer.
I am.  I met him fifteen years ago. I was told there was nothing left, no conscience, no reason, no understanding, in even the most rudimentary sense, of life or death or right or wrong. I met this six- year-old boy with a blank, cold emotionless face and the blackest of eyes, the Devil's eyes. I spent eight years trying to reach him and another seven trying to keep him locked away when I realized what was living behind that boy's eyes was purely and simply... evil.
He was here, earlier tonight, and he may be coming back. I'm going to wait for him.
Nothing's going on. Just kids playing pranks, trick or treating, partying, getting high... I have the feeling you're way off on this...
Have a good time.
Same time, same place.
Can we make Jack-O-Lanterns?
Uh-uh. That's a spook house.
I'm so embarrassed. I couldn't face him...
No...
The bogyman!
DO WHAT I SAY! NOW!
I'm wasting time.
Are there any special instructions?
Shouldn't we pick him up?
Oh, listen...
Mmm?
A lot of works.
Uh-- APRIL  I-i-it has an o-organic quality, you know.
It's really terrible.
Uh...
Oh, uh, listen, David called me up.
Okay, Norman, listen, I really want to talk about this at home.  I think it's a matter for your analyst...and mine.
Oh no.  Not at all.
Yeah, we're the Stanislavski Catering Company.
Yes.
...and, uh, he complained of chest pains.
When did you first notice this?
Look I-I-I'll be okay.  I'll be okay.
Uh-huh.
...ex-husband on the street the other day.
Oh, yes.  Who doesn't?  Look!
And-and maybe, um...maybe we could discuss it sometime.
Thanks for showing me the bookstore. Perhaps you could, uh, take me to an AA meeting sometime.  Uh...uh, I'd love to see what goes on.
Oh, yeah.
Oh.
Wh--, it-it-it-it, it's so sad. She's crazy about me, but somewhere on the, along the line, I've fallen out of love with her.
I can't say anything!
Oh, Elliot, please!  I can't be a party to this!  I'm suddenly wracked with guilt just standing her talking to you on the street!
Lee... uh...
No, no-no-no, I'm sure.
I don't want anyone else ever to have you.
Oh, my God.
I've got to be honest with you.  I met someone else.  I've met someone else.  I...I told you I wasn't going to wait forever.
I know.
Yeah, I know.  I-I can't believe I forgot.
My God!  Wha-what is this?  The Gestapo?  No.
You're not lost.
Oh, honey!
Lee...  you are the only person I can be with...who I really look forward to being with. 
Have I really taught you everything I have to give?  I don't think so.
I can't take this anymore.
Oh, God!  Do you hear a buzzing?  Is there a buzzing?
Like what?!  What?
Can I tell you something?  Can I tell you a secret?
Doesn't she look pretty?
Oh, Hannah, she's-she's just embarrassed in front of you, that's all.
You know, how's everything?  You doing okay?  How's Frederick?  I mean, Elliot.
I think we need to eat.
...a little, uh, hey!  A little hug! What is this?  Now how 'bout a little action from the kids?
I know, I know.
That's a beauty!
Football!
Wow!
I should get a garter belt.
He's the headmaster of Daisy's school.
Oh?
I know, no--  I know.
I mean, y-you know, don't say it that way, you know, because my confidence is not my strong point, I--
So what's new?
No.  She, didn't she say it was, um...she said it was in the publicity department.  That-that can lead to other things.
At least I'm open to new concepts!
This crowd wouldn't know the difference!  They're embalmed!
Yeah, it was.
Yeah, I hope you have, too. MICKEY  I hope so for your sake, because, uh, your personality left something to be desired...
I'm okay.
Oh, nothing much.  You know...
No, well...I've been trying to write.
No, you can tell me.
Well, I'd love it if you'd read it, actually, 'cause I really would value your opinion.
Well, it was just fabulous!  I'm, I, you know...
I thought it was wonder-- There's maybe one or two things in there that I would do differently myself, but...
I was the, I was... You know, it was my fault.  I-- 
Yeah.
Okay.
Get a garter belt...  Get a garter belt and flirt.
Oh...
Dad!
...which I did not get.
You're welcome.  Hare Krishna.
...you don't have to think.
And?
What have they got you doing?
Say it in English.
Oh, yes.  He's found Peace.
...they're sending me.  Out to get Shot.  Hounding me.... they're... 
Then I'm doing fine.
Who called the <u>TV CREWS</u>...?
Somewhere where his family are offering a thirty grand reward for Information, so on.
Do you know the <u>seller</u>?
He is...?
He was the orderly, during Dr. Lechter's stay in Prison.
And how would you know that?
...Mr. Verger would be pleased to make a contribution, to the charitable...
Oh, yes, what?  You'd <u>bribe</u> me, to, to, to, "release" you...?
I can make you rich.
'fraid it's too late.
Starling, I've ordered you to shut...
You seen John Brigham...?
...standard issue...
No. 
I am all attention.
He requests your presence, once again, as part of...
Reinstatement to <u>what</u>?  There ain't nobody there...
I don't <u>think</u> so...
Said what?
I'm an orphan.
...you told me you were studying for your examination by the <u>Studiolo</u>...
And how good of <u>you</u> to remember it. Then, this trip, then, is not a return to <u>America</u>...
...yes.
You have a recent scar on the back of your hand.
Carpal-tunnel syndrome.  From a life of typing.  Commendatore.  <u>History</u>, a hazardous profession.
You know America?
Indeed I am.  And the connection, between Dante, and, in fact, between your illustrious forebears... if you'd come with me, I could show you...
She my foster.
THEN WHERE WAS IT?  I'm sent out there... I'm told that the <u>arrest</u> must be a joint...
And I'm telling you:  You wanna throw a Birthday Party:  Every kid gets a Chance to Play, that's <u>fine</u>, but...
I hope you'll <u>find</u> it so.  Yes.  It's <u>good</u> to see you regaining your strength...
Would that add to your <u>mirth</u>?
What else's he goin to do with his day, he can't work, and he won't steal...
You're going to <u>do</u> that?
N'not <u>that</u> sad.
Y'want to gimme Brigham's pistol?
Why?
Cause I'm tired, cleaning up after you.  Why dontcha gimme the gun?
Fine, thank you, but
I don't understand.
Because it is exclusive... because <u>everyone</u> will be here...
Then we cannot go.
Because we cannot <u>pay</u>...
I'm sure I don't know who you mean.
I'm sure there is, but my young Friend here, would <u>kill</u> you. 
No,I get it, this is my <u>Cavalier</u>.  This gents my Italian Knight.  Take <u>this</u>...  For this shall be my gage, and you can take it into battle.
....that's right.
If <u>he</u> could overcome... his need for... for self-<u>ratification</u>...
...would you use a small word?
What's wrong with approval?  You admired that man.
I..
You want some <u>advice</u>.
Your life has been defined by institutions.  The Orphanage where you were raised, the FBI Academy, the Bureau.  If the Institution is your life, <u>accept</u> it.  Ask to be reinstated on the "Drumgo" task force.  Play their game.
Large resources, Starling, which I prefer to devote elsewhere....
And this Peepers was your...dog?  If it makes you feel better, I probably wasn't paying attention.
Yeah, his lack of intelligence. Sorry, Wendy, but as learning disabilities go, stupidity is often overlooked.
I just wanted to know if you've seen this.
Yowza--Only a virgin could answer that fast.
Geez, what time is it?  I have to go feed Big Chief Oberon...You're right, I miss him. Wichita, that is.  I really want to be with him, but I can't bring myself to--Are you a lesbian or are you...
Talia, just because you happen to be Jewish, doesn't mean you can make fun of someone desecrating the Lord's body...
I know what you mean. But it doesn't put me in too great a position...
Do you really think I care?
Shut the fuck--!
What are you talking about? She hated you! You hated her!  What are you smiling at?
All right.
You don't have anything <u>for</u> her either. Come on, it'll be Very. The note'll give her shower nozzle masturbation material for weeks.
I'll think about it.
Don't tell me. Crest would be stained with loserness.
I'm sorry? What are you oozing about?
What are you doing here?!
I'm giving Veronica her shot. Her first Remington Party. Blow it tonight girl and it's keggers with kids all next year.
Yeah, maybe.
Jealous much?
Hea<u>ther</u>, I've got something going with J.D.
But what about Heather and Ram and Kurt?
Let's knock off early. Go to the mall. Something lame like that.
I don't know. Should you?
Killing her won't solve anything.
Hey, it was good for me too, Sparky.
Don't be a dick. That stuff'll kill her.
No shit, sherlock. I can't believe it. I just killed my best friend.
Exquisite, but I don't think ununderstanding is a word.
Neat. Let's try it out on J.F.K.
I was just making it more special.
Let's kick his ass.
Lighten up, dude. In those woods is some of the finest pussy in the school and we don't even have to buy it a hamburger and a Diet Coke. Punch it in!
May<u>be</u>.
This condescending junk makes suicide seem like a cool thing to do. Hey kids, make your parents and teachers feel like shit! Get the respect in death you'll never get in life.
People just don't take the name Heather seriously. They should, shouldn't they?
Sure. Ciao.
breaks down into heavy sobs.
Have a nice outing, you lot.
Well . . . I better make myself a bit more presentable.
starts to cut up a slice of bacon and offers it to Pauline.
Juliet's infectious . . . she'll be going to hospital.
sighs.
Well, I guess I take after you then!
I'm the Matron's favourite patient and she's shown me her special stitch!
They sent me off to the Bahamas "for the good of my health." They sent me to the Bay of bloody Islands "for the good of my health."
looks startled at the outburst.
Thank you. I bought it especially, Mrs. Rieper.
Somebody's got to help us!
Saint Mario!
He . . .
Well . . . no. But it's so obvious.
Just a couple more . . .
That was what we were led to believe . . .
Too right . . . but he doesn't have a show! Nobody gets into Mother's draws except Daddy!
Goodbye, Mr. Rieper.
You came in for your EEG. You fell asleep and well, I took the liberty of...I'm sorry. You looked like a wreck Trevor.
Shh. Don't blame yourself Trevor. Please.
Maybe I wasn't responsible for the car accident...
Dude there is a track on the carpet between here and the bathroom. It was made by your ass. You've been dragging it all fucking week. What happened to you yesterday?
Have we met?
As in one minus one equals zero yes. Where are you going with this?
Sorry I just kind of... spaced for a second there.
Oh I see. That again. Trevor? I realize it must be hard. But Christ how long does it take someone to move on?
Eighty four.
But... I thought...
You've been cheating on me haven't you?
What?
The best business decision if you ever made I'll bet.
I only married you for your body.
Okay then. Here's the scoop.
I don't know who you are or what you want. I just want to know what's under that sheet...
Surrender yourself... surrender yourself...
No, thanks I've got a... a date tonight-
YOU!
For starters. It's also got fennel, asparagus, olives, some more of mother nature's aphrodisiacs... Back in college, me and my roommates used to call it hard- on stew.
It's getting hot in here.
A lotta people wouldn't have tried. It was pretty brave even trying...
In bad weather, yeah.  Mostly I camp out in the woods.  I thought maybe you were down on your luck too when I picked you up.
The bathroom!  For two days?
It was you!  I thought I heard...
And give a deposition to the jUdge.
I... I'll do the best I can, Bernie.
There was this kid there saying, "Go in there and save my father, mister." And I'm thinking about my boy Joey and this goddamn fireman my wife's seeing. It was like I was supposed to save myself.
I got your bail continued.
"Angel!"  I didn't say "angel," that's a little strong.  Listen, here's the thing, I gotta get over there to the TV station to collect my million bucks.
Twenty-five grand is peanuts!  All you gotta do is get me outta here long enough to collect.
I took a loan on my car and my computer.
Take a look at my employment record, you got my employment record there, right?  You see any unemployment there, any welfare? I'm a taxpayer.  They eat me alive, the tax people, they got taxes on everything, taxes, taxes, taxes, and forms!  Taxes and forms so I can pay your goddamn salary, so you can sit there and write stuff, guys like me pay your wages...
I can't afford no better.  My ex, she attached my pay check for child support payments.  You looking for Bernie LaPlante by any chance?
You couldn't have a problem, Chick, because I personally have got them all.  I cornered the whole goddamn market.  You wouldn't believe... Oh, how ya doin'...?
Ev, it's not my fault!  I'm trying to tell you this incredible --
I had to explain your tendancy to "exaggerate", How you were actually "in country" all of two weeks and how you killed about as many people as the other clerk-typists in your outfit, no more, no less...
How did you acquire this, Mister LaPlante?
Well, I'm not entitled to a million dollars.  I... I... didn't expect... I didn't expect...
You're a celebrity, John.  People are going to want to please you... or use you... or both.
This sofa is a lethal weapon.  The springs... are... the springs... what...?
"For Excellence in the Pursuit of Truth."
What about a reward for coming forward?
Relax, Wally.  He had the shoe and the shoe checks out.
Listen, Gale, I know you're emotionally involved.  Don't be emotionally involved, be professional.  No, Gale, you are not a hardbitten, cynical hard-ass, you just think you are.  You are a goddamn cream puff!  Try and be a hard-ass!
She can't quit.
No, Deak, not a great story.  We backed this guy, he's our boy!  We gave him a vote of confidence, we gave him a million dollars.
We couldn't find his name on the buzzer or on the mailbox, but...
Look at the guy!  He just saved fifty people.  Now he's going to disappear. Who is he?
I didn't ask him.
Inspector Dayton, the cop from Robbery Detail who was looking for you.  They caught the guy who stole your credit cards trying to sell them and he wants...
What toys do you have?
Well, I've been doing a little independent contracting, some carpentry here and there, y'know, do-it-yourself-type stuff.  I still find it very soothing.
That would be monumentally stupid. All I'm saying is --
Yeah, maybe you're right. Everything else is just an excuse. I'm treating the situation with kid gloves because I'm afraid of losing her.
There's so much I want to say to her, it's all jumbled up in my mind, and I don't want her to misunderstand --
Yeah, that was easy.
I bet.  Going into people's homes.
A man?  Was it a dream?
You know how sometimes Neil bugs you and you just get up and walk away from him?
Uh huh.
It's okay, baby, the police are coming.
The same thing -- his business pressures, the whole move and everything.  He's frantic about nailing this new job, worried about screwing over his present boss.
The pocket's a cinch -- I'll sew it up for you after dinner, okay?
Thanks, Mom.
We'd have to get one of those sliding covers for the pool.
You wanted furniture too, didn't you?
You could have a pool to cool off in.
It'll be even shorter if I get that new job.  Come on.
He made, you know, a remark.
Honey, are you okay?
Oh -- great.
There's no card or anything.
Did she water this plant?  It looks a little bent out of shape.
His secretary just confirmed.
C'mon.
Philip, what are <u>you</u> doing here?
That's not a decision for you to make on your own.
No, Philip, I don't want you coming back here.  And if you want to talk to me -- <u>call</u>.
Because it caught my eye when it was in a higher price bracket in the listings.
Sometimes they prefer a quicker return on their investment.
This is a terrific entrance hall, What a welcoming feeling.
Two -- three if you count the husband.
What about cable?
Oh really?  <u>You've</u> been going through a lot of personal crap. You, Princess Di and Madonna?
And I can't help having a cold.
No man!  <u>Go to your room</u>.
Right over here.
Even cosier.
Uh huh.
No joke, Lieutenant.
You can believe what you want.  You saw the tape.
Not now.  I'm busy.
Y'know, the guys in robbery are gonna get kind of upset.  We're stepping on their toes of this one.
This ties in with Nash.
Doesn't it scare you walk through the park at night?
Where have you been for the last seven years?
Hey -- somebody want to gimme a hand here?
Caution shows wisdom.
I learned my fill from Romeriz.
What?
I'm sure they will.
We cannot write our destiny, Macleod. In the end it could be you and me.
What do you think?
I would like to say goodbye.
How?
Where I'm going you cannot follow.
Because, it's for the best.  There are somethings that are better left unexplained.
A lucky guess.
Because it's my name.
Why don't you tell me.
Not unless they're immortal.
That's what the Kurgan said.
I can take care of myself.
Me too.
And now it's time to come out of the shadows.
If you search your heart you know all the good you have done.  Your strength comes from your heart -- because in your heart you know what you are fighting for is good and just.  This room is filled with memories. If you search through them you can find the good -- the difference you have made.  And now, it is for you to make the greatest difference of all. Look in your heart, Conner -- and you will see the good that you have done.
Alright.  It's going to take a few minutes.  I have to call and verify the funds.
Don't shout, Larry.  I'm three feet away.
That would be the girl who opened the door.  Are the others inside?
The mother is in Florida visiting her sister.  The father works at home, so he's probably inside.
Bullshit--a man will do anything to save his family.  Who's running the show up there?
I have contacts in Los Angeles.  Lawyers and judges who can help you.
We're on foot.  We can't get away.
Stop it!  They found the truck, Kev! They're already behind us!
Like what?
We're fucked until we think of a way out; then we're rich.
The only way he can keep the cash is if nobody knows about it.  He's gotta cap all three of us before they even read our rights.  He's probably planning it right now.
I want a helicopter to take us to Mexico.
The one and only.  We got a little problem out here, Dennis.
Okay.
Two hundred thousand cash, right in your pocket, no one needs to know.
Give up.
It won't be a problem.
Goddamnit, tell me what you <u>know</u>.  Did the cops go in?  Did Smith have the disks?
<u>I don't know</u>.  Talley talked those punks into letting Smith out.  He's fucking us over, Glen.  That guy is fucking us over.
If you shoot me, he'll kill your daughter.  Do you want to lose both of them?
You're hiding, Jeffrey.  You're hiding from the job and you're hiding from me.
I still see that boy's eyes.
Don't worry about it.  How are you doing?
I don't drink beer.
I don't know what you're talking about.
Kevin's gone, your daddy's gone, everybody's gone.
I don't see why you can't just lock me in.  It's not like I can go anywhere.
Kevin, my father needs a doctor.
Keep your voice down.  I'm taking you and your brother out of here.
Yes.
Then we don't know if she's part of this or not.  Mickey, you up?
What's wrong with the radio?
Did the boy say that any of them are in immediate danger?
Mike found a red pickup abandoned on Flanders.  You see it?
Don't be funny, Chief.  You can't afford it.
Dennis won't let me go to the desk.  He makes me sit on the floor.
Then you have everything.  You can put them away.
A man has my family.  Gold watch here. Dark tan.
That would be Glen Howell.  He was on his way for the disks.
You will re-assume command.  In two hours, a group of my people will arrive at York Estates.  You will tell the Sheriffs that they are an FBI tactical team.
Your phony FBI assholes.
We, who is we?
That's what I came to talk to you about.
How much?
How many in your family?
And four children?
You want to buy anymore cockroaches ask for Captain Naramunju.
Yes. With some re-inforcements I'm confident we could impose order.
What's happening?
Congratulations. You should spit in my face.
Don't bullshit me, Paul. You're the smartest man here. You have them all eating out of your hand. You'd own this fucking hotel, except for one thing.
I can't, I don't have the men.
The rebels have fought their way into the city. They have many Hutu prisoners.
It's a single malt, Glenmorangie. I thought you'd like it. Anything you need, gentlemen, let me know.
The United Nations are still here.
Well rewarded Those were his words.
I am strong, Paul, like a lion.
Today.
Wonderful country, wonderful golf. I wonder - will I ever go back? What do you think?
You cannot go back to the hotel. The crazy men are going there now. Better to come with me.
How so.
I am on a list! What list?
I led no massacres.
Very good.
At least.
No whiskey, no spirits. Your rich cockroaches at the hotel, they will have to do without their scotch. Anyway, I have bled that cow enough Paul.
Youre drunk.
Just give me a moment to get your keys.
Of course.
Don't worry. I have a job this morning. I must go to visit my good friend George Rutagunda. You know George?
For supplies, you drive.
Just drive, Gregoire.
Rusesabagina. Paul Rusesabagina.
We are to meet Mr. Rutagunda.
He wants your wisdom.
They do not have your connections.
Please. Let them stay 'til morning. The militia will not come here, they know you are a Hutu with influence.
Zozo, get a key for two staff bedrooms. Put these people in them.
Your card says Hutu. Take our children, go and get the twins, pay money at the roadblocks. Get them out. Please.
I'm not going alone. I'll take Gregoire with me. He's a good Hutu, and he wants to impress me now.
To be closer. So that I could marry you.
What sort of car?
Why?
It depends where you sit Zozo. In coach it is like the bus to Giterama.
You have taken business class?
How much beer?
Thank you, sir.
The staff, the guests.
Who is this Simon?
Not too big on it myself -- but then again, not on marriage either.
Convinced all those that needed convincing: you're an official dead lady.
-- but nobody has yet, Donald. They just haven't been brought to that breaking point. They have to believe proof-positive that their lives are in danger.
Pritchett, take it down a couple hundred decibels, what is your problem?
A very, very scary game. But then look at the bright side: if there's only one of you still upright at dawn, you'll be leaving here with five million dollars in your pocket.
I don't know!!
Didn't catch his or her name, just followed them down here. Somebody all in white surgical gown.
I think one of you has been part and parcel of making this situation!
I'm just the Greeter -- and in that capacity, I now urge you all strongly to --
The Soul of the House. Everything that's corrupt about it... My father trapped it in there just before he died. You see, he purchased the house to restore it... We were going to live here... Nothing can live here. I was just a kid... The first time I saw it, I thought it was beautiful... It was just a dark mist turning into the corner of the room... then it started to move... then death started to happen... First the workers.. six in all... then my father...
Price didn't make the guest list... The house did. It wants vengeance.
Prove it how?
Don't push it.
No -- keep pulling, it's moving!
-- where the hell were you?
Better living through electricity.
He's gotta still be down here.
The guy whose hair I do has his own TV show. All I've got is a blow-dryer and a dream.
You shouldn't be -- you were nearly just killed, sweetheart.  And now that our birthday girl is finally here, let the games begin!
I guess it was stupid of me not to expect something this twisted from you. Well, congratu-fucking-lations, Steven: Round One, you win.
Well, not quite. See, those people down there: they aren't the ones I invited.
Oh, no-no-no -- much more bang for everyone's buck to nail the bitch --
-- I pose you the same question --
-- that wasn't my original plan, but it is starting to look more attractive --
I was in the middle of --
-- being utterly fucking useless, what else is new.
Maybe if I --
Very good. Well, I think I can say with complete honesty: I've never heard of any of you.
Something with the power, I don't know!!
I'll take my chances.
Rewind that.
Maybe it was just its time to finally fall apart.
Why not?
Not ghosts... at least not what you're thinking... Vannacutt used to dump the bodies of his failed experiments somewhere in the house...
Something....happened --
-- I'm coming --
-- something horrible...I don't understand --
These records only go back to 1880. But...  ...wait a minute...
I'll be able to do a search, to find out who lived here previously.  And who died here.
Thank you.  If you told me two years ago we'd be living here, I would never have believed it.  Do you live around here?
Yes.  It was.
No!
Yes.
I'm scared!
What do you mean?  Mommy? You're scaring me!
Where is she?
She's here.
Take me to her.
Why?
That's great, honey.
I hope we have more success than we did with the cleaning service.
Must be...
Whatever you say.
It's not going to work.  I'm too smart for you.
So what are you saying?
Yeah, I'd say some weird things have happened.
Are you ok?
Should I...
Not going!  Are you out of your mind?!  Wait!
I'm all right...
Well that's what we're here for. I mean -
We usually find nothing.  We've debunked many a reported haunting. About ninety five percent of the cases had some technical explanation.
She's at school.  We've tried not to upset her more than she's been.
Yeah, they told us this was the best.
So what should we do, father?
Thank you.
Perhaps I'll see you in church.
Well what is it!
I don't know!  Trust what I'm saying, we have to open this wall!
I mean hardly any thigh.  I'm telling you, Joey; shorter skirt, more lift on the leg-cross ... and you're made.
That is the story of my life.
What can we do?
Then tell me what to do.
Your apartment.
What happened to him?
I want to talk to you.  We met ... now, listen, don't hang up, OK? ... We met at the hospital last night.
Oh yeah.  Yeah.  Well ... Look, I'll make a deal with you ... My boyfriend threw me out, right?  I'll trade you. You give me couch-space.  I'll give you talk.  OK?
What is it?
Taken what?
No!  No, that's OK.  I like to.  I love boiling water.  It's a specialty of mine.  Why don't you go watch cartoons?
Woah.  Wait a minute.  Who?  The kid?
No.  We want ...
He's a barman.  Whatever.  Do you mind if I continue?
Oh.  Like I'm not an interesting person.
I'm JP Monroe, you stupid little bitch. Now get the fuck out of my life.
You ... I can't fucking believe you, you bastard!  You get me in here ...
What do you want?
No.  I mean, really?  Because I'm concerned for you, sweetheart.  I care about you.  I guess I miss you.  I'm sorry we split up.  I'm sorry I ...
Something like that.
Gum.
Now that you're born again,what do you wanna do?  Statue of Liberty?  Entertain some ladies? Miss Saigon tix?  Seduce some women?  Play Nintendo?  Bone some chicks?
Oh man, you still got a thing for those unmasculine European coffees? Who's your buddy?
Oh, not much.  Mario Brothers want me to do a job.
Hmmm, nasty little safe on the 7th.
"He kicks up at anything he hears.
Geez, Gates was killed.  Who do we send the thank you note to?
Alex, my man, it's time to play a little offense.  Where's your tux?
Geez, this Art Treasures Room looks like a burnt diaphragm.
Okay.
Don't worry, we'll get it...
Too-do-loo, babe.
Ooh-kay...
No, your Eminence.  I think he's going to steal the Codex, as early as next week.
Oh, why couldn't I be the Cardinal in charge of catering.... If the Mayflowers get the three sections of Da Vinci's crystal and his instructions for the gold machine-- Aie-yi--Do we got anything?  What of Alex, Hawk's friend, where is his loyalty?
I'm sorry for losing it back there, but you must remember, sister, you have vows to God as well as a mission to the world.
How long were you in?
I seem to have a thing for sinning. sinning.  Check please....
It's also been a long time for me.  I--
You re not "some guy" anymore, Hudson.  Right now, you're the only guy.  Without your help, I....
When the Mayflowers find out we have the Codex, they're going to want to make a deal...
We're here to say, your government was right.
Hey, guys, I've always wanted to sing like Franki Valli and the other seasons, but come on....
You certainly do.
So when's that Sebastian-Cabot- Buckingham-Palace-looking- Butlerhead getting here?
I killed some lovable working class Italian-diabetic, but you killed the most significant male figure of the decade and a kind, gentle lover.  So don't play with me.
If you do anything to my friend...
With a little jazz.
We dumped the whole load. Now quit showboating, Addison --
Cheap! Cheap! It's never been more valuable! And I'm ruined! Ruined!
Yeah, yeah. Say, you won't tell anyone about me, will you?
Well, maybe I --
I'm happy enough.
Okay, Miss Archuh.  ...I got gears to see to.
Yeah.
A sawbuck!
You've lost it, Aim. You've gone soft by the looks of it -- soft on the dummy from Dubuque --
Well, I just don't know how to thank you, Mr. Barnes --
-- or lack thereof?
Well, I don't know; maybe she does deserve it. Maybe she should've come in to face you man to man.
I'm quite sure I don't know what you mean.
I bet that's exactly what she tells herself! But you and I both know she's just a dried-up bitter old maid. Say, how about you and I grab a little dinner and a show after work? I was thinking maybe The King and I --
Let me look.
Yes, you can get carrot juice or Italian coffee, and the people there -- well, none of them quite fit in. You'd love it -- why don't you come there with me -- they're having a marathon poetry reading on New Year's Eve. I go every year.
That kind of person would come back as a wildebeest, or a warthog. No, I think it more likely that you were a gazelle, with long, graceful legs, gamboling through the underbrush. Perhaps we met once, a chance encounter in a forest glade. I must have been an antelope or an ibex. What times we must have had -- foraging together for sustenance, picking the grubs and burrs from one another's coats. Or perhaps we simply touched our horns briefly and went our separate ways...
We have to be realistic, Amy. You know things have slowed down a little here at Hudsucker --
Now, Aim --
Consider this my resignation --
Norville, I'm sorry, I... I tried to tell you... so many times... It's hard to admit when you've been wrong. If you could just... find it in your heart to -- to give me another chance --
As a three-dollar bill.
Sez me! Amy Archer. Why is he an Idea Man -- because Hudsucker says he is? What're his ideas? Why won't they let anyone interview him?...
He grins wolfishly.
For instance, take a look at this sweet baby...
Martinis are for squares, man.
This I know, Benny.
It's the most beautiful t'ing I ever saw.
Waring Hudsucker! Na-ha-ha-ha-ha! Say, buddy! When is the sidewalk fully dressed? When it's 'wearing' Hudsucker! Na-ha-ha-ha!
We don't crawl at Hudsucker Industries! Get out of my office! Leave your uniform in the locker room!
'...But Sid, let me urge you to work closely with the new president, and to keep giving Hudsucker Industries all your energies -- but not your soul. For while we must strive for success, we must not worship it. Long live the Hud. Waring Hudsucker...'
Barnes! Where the hell have you been! And where's my voucher?!
I need that voucher! I told you a week ago it was important!
Sure, sure. And did your classmates there call you 'jerk' or...  ...'schmoe'?
It's not important in itself -- some elevator boy you fired came to me claiming you'd stolen the idea for the, uh, the hoop dingus from him --
Twenty bucks says not here she don't find one.
Plan two: Here come the waterworks.
No, Bennie: Lumbago.
She must have been beautiful.  What happened to her, Alma?
Yes.
That is good.  But I'd like to know more about the case.
My brother's wife.
Ah, yes, our Paul, strong and silent and very sad -- quite the Byronic character. Perhaps I ought to cultivate it.
Higher mathematics.  Two ounces to a drink -- three drinks, six ounces.
Wait. I want to listen.
You read my thoughts, Mr. Holland.
Yes.  But it was once the figurehead of a slave ship.  That's where our people came from -- from the misery and pain of slavery. For generations they found life a burden. That's why they still weep when a child is born -- and make merry at a burial.
Mrs. Holland must have been beautiful ---
Don't.  It will save you a great deal of trouble and other people a great  unhappiness.
Wesley can be very entertaining.
But for Wes -- it must be a temptation to him.
You didn't drive her mad.
Didn't I?  I don't know.  That's the simple truth of it.  I don't know.
I hated her.
No.  It's not just how I felt toward Jessica.  I've been cruel to even you.
That's past -- that's over and done with...
Paul, we're not trying to blame Miss Connell.  It isn't a question of blame.  It's a question of what we are to do with Jessica.  The commissioner is very concerned.
Because he drove Jessica insane -- deliberately -- coldly!
Foolish?  Tell them how foolish it is, Paul -- tell them!
Overpriced bomb, cost over $6 million -- no stars, and no one's into the horror genre these days anyway. I'm advising the company recommend reducing positions there. It's disaster films that are gonna stay at the top.
Yeah, good.
It's you Ben who needs to talk. I've had my say, and I'm waiting to hear back from you.
What do you think?
You have to bring this up now? What? Did I do something here? Is that it? Is it something I did?
No advice from the experts, huh?
Your unfaithfulness -- that's what I'm trying to talk about. Your unfaithfulness. Your betrayal. Your dalliance. And you won't do me the dignity of being up front about it.
Am I unfaithful? Is that what you're trying to say?
Gotcha.
In a bit.
Don't bullshit me around, Janey. Jesus Christ, I waited around for more than half an hour, in nothing but my boxer shorts, and -- and what's all that about? What the hell happened?
Jimmy? Jimmy? I don't know how to take this. And what do you mean, Jimmy? I thought you said you and your husband --
Nothing.
Yeah.
And why are you still calling me dad? You're forty years old already, and --
Oh for crying out loud Ben, you don't mean to tell me that your marriage is going down the drain now --
-- 73, and divorce is as easy as paying off a traffic ticket, and for crying out loud, Ben, be a man and just get it over with. I would have if I'd had the chance.
Well, maybe they have one of those filter jobs in the kitchen --
Maybe you just need -- look, can you wait here a sec, I need to tidy up -- just a minute, I'll be right back. You'll wait?
Sure. Maybe coffee.
We were just riding around.
It's not a bother.
Well I of course flatter myself that our church is not exactly what most people would call organized religion -- at times it's the disorganization that's liberating -- and of course I've begun to minister much more in what one might call therapeutic environments, in small groups, and one on one, couples --
They say you never forget.
Ouch.
Man, Francis, you are one drug addled elitist freak, and when the revolution comes I do not want to be lined up with you and shot, 'cause you're fucking ripe for political reeducation, you know, like in the fields.
I gotta get to English class.
Sleep all day. I mean, look, it's already getting dark outside, and you're just getting up.
Yeah, Paul, are you gonna get home okay?
Play with the whip.
Great, thanks for the tip.
Hey, it's a sellable skill.
You know Libbets, I really feel, you know, like a real connection to you --
Yeah but you don't even know me really.
It's like very positive, and I feel a real special feeling, because you really --
Hah hah you're funny. A bath. Like a brother and sister. Oh man, I'm so wasted.
You think Francis is going to beat me to the punch here?
No one.
Geometry?
Then why'd you come after me?
Yeah.
I have not touched your sh--  Stuff. You watching this?
Is this Charles?
Um, ten-o-five. Why? Where are you?
What are you doing at home on a Friday night?
The ones you built?
No.
He wouldn't blow up. He'd just get all mangled or twisted.
Sure.
What's the D.A. got them on?
Good.  He's up next.
Yeah.  All over.
That must have been awful for you.
Okay.
How much closer would you say you were?
Five feet?  Seven feet?
Worth pursuing?
Don't worry.  I'll have a cool scar.
I wish I'd had the chance to get to know him better.  Take him fishing or something.
We just gotta catch the bastard, right?
Anything.  It's important.
Around twelve-thirty.
What?
I beeped you over two hours ago.
Cut some kind of a deal.  I heard that's what Flynn's doing...
Will?
You tell Buck and I'm involved whether I like it or not...
But she was seeing someone else on the side.
Stuff.
Just stuff.  I don't fucking remember.
You're not missing much.
You don't know.
Brody...I don't know...  ...Something Brody!
Oh?
Thought you might find that.
Expensive dresses.  A heart necklace.
Surely you know the one who made you...
Then God does not exist...
He knew nothing. He just didn't care.
Listen to me.
I'm not innocent. But I'm afraid. She feels she's in danger from the others.
It's already begun. If you want to save her, send her away.
Like moths around the candle of the age. Decadent, useless. They can't reflect anything. But you do. You reflect its broken heart.
Louis, they cannot be brought back. There are some things that are impossible, even for me.
You let them do it.
I came to make peace with you, even if you're the father of lies. I want things to be as they were.
I'll put you in your coffin. Forever.
Lestat taught you all you need to know about that.
Tell me why...you've got to tell me...
Don't mock, Claudia...
Be still!
He wants you as you want him. He's been waiting for you. He wants you for a companion. He bides his time that place. he finds them as dull and lifeless as we do.
And who will care for me my love, my dark angel, when you are gone?
Give it to me!!!
I can't do it.
I wish I were. But if I were, what would I want with you?
But why do you want me?
But how do you know?
I can't.
Come the New Orleans then. There's an opera on tonight. A real french opera! We can dine in splendour!
I know. Let her alone.
Oh God Lestat. I felt peace. I felt an end to the craving.
That and more.
Louis, Louis, I gave you the gift --- help me ---
Don't fear me, Lestat. I bring you no harm.
And the more you tried, the more I wanted you... a vampire with your beautiful, suffering human heart. And how you suffered... I need your forgiveness, Louis.
It's just a room...
But I thought vampires didn't like the light.
But times were different then. I was a man at that age. The master of a large plantation just south of New Orleans...
Peasant rumours, superstitions about garlic, crosses, stakes in the hear, all that - how do you say again? Bull shit. But one of our kind? Not a whisper.
Yes...
Is that bad?
Wait...Did you say off-season?
I'd call this four spoiled city kids who wouldn't know a hurricane if it blew up their butts.  All we can do now is batten down and ride it out. If things get really bad, there's a storm shelter.
Stupid. What were you thinkng?
I should go up there. I should call her back, tell her I'm coming.
Titus, you're so stoned, you'd end up in Spain.
Up-tighteous and self-righteous.
Tyrell, I appreciate it, but have you seen my people dance? We make the mouth face, we move the fingers --
Not me...no way...
What do we do?
You never do...The guy at the nightclub, the body in your room last night. Little notes that only mean something to you. How do we even know you're not the one behind this --
I'm sorry.
Right. Planes get hit by lightning. They get hit by meteors. They hit other planes.
It's...him.
I scared you -- I crossed the line --
Hey, you don't have to appologize to me. I'm the one. I understand.  I'm going to take a walk and dry off.
It's in my room!
Just for a minute, baby. I got something I wanna tell you.
Baby, I finally got you alone in this Jacuzzi and I don't wanna be discussin' hair care.
I'd hate for you to have to blow...your whistle.
How's Julie?
Well, Karla, what're you doin' at home over the long fourth weekend?
Well, I'm in school and --
We'll call you back with all the details...So what's your favorite radio station?
Must have missed the sign.
Excuse me, but this island didn't have a murder rate until you people showed up.  I've never seen a dead body before.
Hey -- shut up, okay?
Don't bother. Go to bed and get some sleep. I'll be working late.  I can hear any movement down here.
Good winds and bad winds!
I just came to see if your prayer would entertain me as much as my medicine seems to amuse you.
On my word! That's what they believe.
Last night Dr. Drossos -- today you or I -- oh, no, Oliver, it can't be you, I couldn't stand it.
She has never mentioned her family.
I was looking for you.
I do not know him, but I have seen him.
You have forgotten my last name?
We quarreled. She never dared get angry or frightened -- but I said things to her -- it was an attack, I know it was.
Mr. Davis seems a good prospect young handsome, sympathetic -- ready to listen to you and feel sorry for you - -
) But Thea -- She stands in your way. I know you. I know your little hints  the way you can turn the truth into a lie --
You wouldn't tell that 
Her name is Thea?
Nothing, really. She's been under a great strain -- the journey -- the battle --
I knew that feuds still went on, but I didn't think people like you and the General would be involved.
All I'm asking is thirty days more . . .
All right  all right.
Ernie, I'm a rich tourist today. How about driving me home in style?
I hate to do this, fella.
Good year? Well, between you and me, Mr. Carter, we're broke.
Clarence Odbody, A-S-2.
I haven't won my wings yet. That's why I'm an angel Second Class.
Oh, you mustn't say things like that. You . . .  . . . wait a minute. Wait a minute. That's an idea.  What do you think? Yeah, that'll do it. All right.  You've got your wish. You've never been born.
Your lip's stopped bleeding, too, George.
That's him when he was twelve, back in 1919. Something happens here you'll have to remember later on.
Not a soul.
Well, wait and see.
No!
Clarence, you do a good job with George Bailey, and you'll get your wings.
Oh, thank you, sir. Thank you.
They went out of business years ago.
I'm not sleepy. I want to look at my flower.
Looks like she can keep Harry on his toes.
No, no, Martini. Your boss. Where is he?
Did you get a doctor?
Do me a favor, will you, George?
Well, you remember my kid sister, Mary?
She was here first.
Hello, Violet. Hey, you look good. That's some dress you got on there.
We'll save them for seed. A toast!
Have you put any real pressure on those people of yours to pay those mortgages?
I'm not interested in your book. I'm talking about the Building and Loan.
I'd like to do that.
Have you notified the police?
They don't have that kind of money, Mr. Potter. You know that. You're the only one in town that can help me.
Huh? Yeah-yeah-yeah . . . soybeans. Yeah.
Me?
I don't know. Maybe I will say it. How old are you anyway?
You may kiss my hand.
Come on, tell me.
What is it you want, Mary? What do you want? You want the moon? Just say . . .
Oh, I worked there for a couple of vacations, but I don't know . . . I guess I was homesick.
Don't you like her?
Yes, I called him right away. He says it's nothing to worry about.
With butter, if they got any....
How fast is enough?
Someone pop your balloon?
Sean!  Listen!  Listen to me, Sean.
The Shark.
We'll take your supercargo.
Want to swim home?
Can you get us a line?
It's okay, it's okay.  What's the matter?  Tina?  Honey?  Hey ---
Happy to do it.
Could you just keep that crowd back, please?
You got it.
Not the drugstore!
Nine-thirty, ten maybe.
What about tennis?  Riding? fixing up old cars?  Bartending?
Bartending?  I'm 17.
You stay right here.  You're going in with me.
At least you're safe.  What about the others?
Stay here.  Don't go anywhere. Just stay here.
It means I don't like all that grab-ass and heavy breathing with my wife, it means I know who's out to screw me here, and it means that I know something none of you know because I've been there -- and I don't want to go through that horror again.  Ever!
First things first.
You don't tell me my job, and I won't tell you about yours, okay?
What're you guys doing today?
In the den.
Because, I'm in the middle of a boating accident, I got only four regular cops and one secretary, and a Chief Deputy who is constantly fiddling with the police boat   He's another one.
It's an island.  Got to run.
Nothing.
Ooohh, nothing.  I just got fired, that's all.
Don't rush into it -- we may need the income.
We have done something -- hell, we damn near went broke putting up a shark watch tower on the beach -- it's the only one in 2000 miles, y'know.
Martin, when we build up our tax base a little, you can have every- thing you want; right now, the town's broke.
A tragedy.  But that was a boating accident; no bites, no sharks, nothing but a boating accident.
Don't push it this time.  If you do, it won't turn out the way you want, I guarantee you that.
Get him the hell over to Amity Point, the old lighthouse.  Right now.
If they're not at the light, look for them.  I don't want them out there.  Get them back to port!
Yeah?  Then what?
When?
Shouldn't he be at home?
No.  Find your brother, okay?
That's you.
I'm not crazy about blind dates.
I want you to meet my cousin.
Hang on, hang on...Okay, go.
Okay, okay, coming....
I know.
What the hell, they can't fire both of us -- someone's got to be in charge, right?  Which way are we going?
I don't care about the overtime, I'm hungry.  And cold.  And most of all, bored.
Oh, great.
Yeah.  Go on, beat it.
So it can't be done like that.  The man's a menace, plain and simple.
I'm only walking him.  You caught him.  You have to be exhausted.
Get the hose!  We've got to force more water through the gills and oxygenate him!
Okay... Have them get it out of the tank.
Yeah.  Down there.
No.
She can take care of herself. She doesn't need you.
See you later.
My imagination isn't that good.
We play hide and seek all the time.  They find a lot of things.
I don't have a choice.
Take a deep breath and hold it.
What mind?  If I had a mind, I'd never have let you talk me into this.
I talked you into this?
Bracelets.
It's easier to lure sharks at night.
Get some sleep.  And tell Sean I'm sorry.
How's your patient?
Okay.
Hydrophobia...
It was removed from Charlie Overman's body.
Couple of fractures, lacerations. They say he's gonna be all right.
It's a construction job.  I'm the only one that can do it.
You don't have to prove anything.
Calvin, let me go down there and kill the bastard.
Three hundred million years of evolution have created the greatest butcher the world's ever known.
It's one of the world's greatest creatures.
What in hell is that?
I know it and I will not go down into this lagoon as long as you carry that!
Look, Doctor, this isn't one of your pet porpoises we're after. It's a torpedo of muscle. Murderous expertise!  I've seen bleeding sharks try to eat themselves!  Don't be so concerned about them.  Worry about yourself.
And I like you.
Somebody could have gotten hurt.
Hope with none of my girl friends.
Better than catching Sean's herpes.
How long you staying?
You like Florida?
Well, wait till you see the rest.
Sure am.
I don't know, what else is there?
No, think of something else.
Take it up.
What're you doing later?
Now what?
That?
Well, we're not going to hurt it, old boy.  I say, love, is Flipper ready to go?
I will, old boy, tomorrow.  Our work is done here.  Just came to say goodbye, and good luck.
I know.  But we show it's not closing.
Okay, okay... We'll get someone on it.
Something wrong?
You know Overman?
Yeah, he'll really go for that.
We're in love.
No, really.  I've never met anyone like her before.  This is it.
Did you hear what I said?  Come inside....
It's time for tea, Grandma.
He told me you both did....
Don't give me that preoccupied scientist crap.  I'm trying to get ready for....
Thea was attacked by a shark....
Do you and Michael ever talk about his work...?  About spending so much time working in the water?
It's beginning....
I always thought when I grew up I'd know what to do about things like this...I don't even know if he's serious....
You rigged it...You spent all that money on an education and you come back looking like this....
I won't....
I'm just getting started....
Once he locked himself in the bathroom and your grandfather had to get the ladder and climb in through the window....
You look tired....
I don't want to talk about that.
Promise me....
Doesn't matter....
You're impossible....
Sharks come and go, Ellen.  People don't have anything to do with it....
Give it up... Kick it in the ass... Get on with your life....
Good.  I have two left....
There are...I'm tired of one-way conversations....
Because it wouldn't occur to you to know why.  Blushing suits you....
My vision is perfect....
Will you get the bloody hell out of here....
Get her started....
What's that....?
I fly elephants for smugglers....
Any faster and it'll turn into a flying Cuisinart and dice us into oblivion....
I'm separating the ladies from the gentlemen....
You're nothing but a bunch of goddamn romantics.  You're never going to amount to anything.
As the sun slowly sets in the West, we bid a fond farewell to the family of conch....
When I invited you...
My name goes on that report.  It's a half-assed job, I don't get my doctorate.  Neither do you....
What the hell does Hoagie have to do with this?
'Snuck up on me....'
Shove it....
You'll be the eternal tropo...The old man and the sea...Know the words to this one?  'Oh, the shark has pretty teeth, dear, and he shows them pearly white...'
You don't like my voice...?
I don't like the song.
Anybody ever tell you you're nuts....
No way....
It's my fault...I have to....
In a few minutes....
I told you....
Gone to Ben Masters' place.  Cow tipping.
Yes.
Well, with me, it's all right. I'll kiss you and hug you. You see if I don't.  Now Mama, Mama, stop now. You're gettin' kittenish. Mama, listen, I'm gonna sing this like I will if I go on the stage. You know, with this show. I'm gonna sing it jazzy. Now get this ...
How about any guys on your staff?
You heard. Look for the knife.
"Welcome to Eureka."
Uh huh .. He's well rehearsed ..
What d'you mean, I just opened it for you? This is <u>French</u> champagne.
Since when did you drink diet soda?
Watch my lips .. <u>Don't get into it</u> ..
Thank Christ we got a witness.
They possibly did - but they nev- er had a head, so they never had a bullet - and they never got an I.D. - not on any of em - never bust a homicide unless you know who your victim is - we're the first to get a positive identity.
I was wrong.
That's just what I wanna find out.
I spose I'm drinking myself to sleep. It's Helena's Christmas songs .. they're really pretty ..
I'm going up to the institute.
It's twenty of three.
What d'you mean, "bits."
No.
No, Sir.
Got a letter from this Goodridge guy? Says, you're upsetting his students?
I am calm .. <u>I am calm</u> ..
Your predecessor. He did- n't like to get outta bed. Catch you later, Freddy T ..
No. Except he smoked. Like you.
I don't know.
I'm sorry. I'll get my things.
I'm sorry .. I don't like sitting in the middle of a restaurant .. I feel like everyone's looking at me ..
I know, but you pick on the one time in my life I like not to remember. I was in the bad lands. Really not well. It's something that happens to a lota cops. We don't wanna talk about that.
He said you're quite chubby. And you have a nervous tick.
I can't identify him ..
I'm blind because my father drank.
C'mon, Chief, if it's sensitive, tell me .. I'm not taking notes ..
Two or three years ago.
Sure you can. Anyway, parties are all about standing still ..
Tonight I'm feeling lucky ..
No one's gonna make that Gent. Six months investigation, & the nearest we got, we thought he was a sailor.
Seventy-two clients.  ONE stayed.  Jacket on, tie in pocket. _ 44.
I think I was trying to sleep with you at the time.
King of the Housecalls! Master of the Living Room!
Oh honey.  It's spun.
You're imagining it.
Then you shouldn't have begged me to hire him.
No no. I knew.
Wait.  That's yesterday, from the other office. Today is...
Yeah.  That too.  I broke up with Avery.
We will be fine!
Oh good.
You walked out on a job for me, and I won't ruin that.
Bye you guys. _ 88.
No.  I have to go in.  I live here.
Okay. Wait here a second.  Do we really want to do this?
No kidding.  I looked over and saw the shadow of two curious shoes in the doorway of the kitchen.
-- well, Rod, your agent passed me a note before the show. He says that your deal memo has been signed by the Arizona Cardinals. Four years for ten-point-two million dollars.  Playing in the state where you grew up.
Told myself -- if he shows up, we'll stick with him.
So you empowered Bob Sugar to deal with Denver behind my back?
The least you could do is nod and act sympathetic --
Uh, not today, but --
Yeah, man, it means love, respect, community... and the dollars too. The package.  The kwan.
What do you know about dating a single mother?
I didn't "shoplift the pooty."  We were thrown together and -- I mean it's two mutual people who --  Alright, I shoplifted the pooty.
I'm asking you a question --
She's an NFL publicist... amazing sense of style... former athlete... volleyball... world class... really knows how to live every moment of her life, which is why I should take a nap now...
To the pools?
I'm fine.  What's up?
Funny...   I better go to bed.
Right up ahead, buddy --
What is it?
What's a bad idea?
You hate to swim.
Oh, don't worry about that.
Nothing.
What did you say!
What about Eric?
DAD!
then we should...
He loves you too.
We'll be broke in four weeks.
It's a wonder you aren't. I'm amazed, Eric. I barely lasted 30 hours. You lasted eight weeks.
A raptor claw. I use to have one. A fossil.
You know, I've been traveling and I'm very tired. Maybe some other time.
Establishing a perimeter. Making it safe. These guys are really good. One of them was a Green...
You can stick with us, or you can go and look for him. Either way you're probably not getting out of here alive.
But you never came across just one.
That cheap aftershave I send you every Christmas, you actually wear it.  I'm touched.  Sit down, sit down, what brings you to Mombassa?
How do you mean?
You think I'm all talk, Eddie?
When you have a lot of time to think, it's funny who you remember.  It's the people who challenged you.  It is the quality of our opponents that gives our accomplishments meaning.  I never told you how sorry I was about what happened after we returned.
After the accident at the park, a hurricane wiped out our facility on Site B.  We had to evacuate and leave the animals to fend for themselves. And they did.  For four years I've fought to keep them safe from human meddling, now I want you to go there and document them.
Stop saying fantastic.  Where are you going?
My vacation is over in a week.
No, Dad.  I have thoughts of my own once in a while.
You know, at the bus stop.  With the hair?
That was about a year ago.
I once saw a bull elephant die charging a jeep.  All the jeep had done was startle the bull's calves. I saw a lioness carry wounded prey four and a half miles, all the way back to its den, just to teach its cubs how to finish off a kill.
Killing lessons?  Heartwarming.
If your university felt you were causing it embarrassment by selling wild stories to Hard Copy, I hardly see how I am to--
So that others would know about this place?
Think fast, Sarah.
Maybe.  Maybe not.
JUMP!
It could have been worse, John.  It could have been a lot worse.
Uh - - about two million.
Yeah, again, in  theory, but - -
'Bout thirty seconds.
Remember - - viable embryos.  They're no use to us if they don't survive.
Anybody at all.  Feel free to speak up.
They are?  I'll be damned.
Pretty sure.
They'll all be fine.  Who better to get the children through Jurassic Park than a dinosaur expert?
Why?
Well, not one of those, well yeah, a possibly one at some point could be a good thing.  What's so wrong with kids?
The what?
- - a gizzard - -
- - what happens is that after a while, the stones get smooth, every six weeks, so the animal regurgitates them - -
- - and swallows fresh ones.
And scary.
It's anti-nature.
It changed.  Why?  Okay, back over your wrist.  Because and here is the principle of tiny variations - - the orientations of the hairs - -
Unpredictability....
And even if we haven't seen it yet, I'm quite sure it's going on in this park right now.
Hola, bienvenido
I understand that.  I'm sorry to hear that. We'd be well advised to deal with this situation now.  The insurance company - -
I can't believe we invited Ian Malcolm.
And the concrete moats, and the motion sensor tracking systems.  Donald, dear boy, do try to relax and enjoy yourself.
Tim.  Which car were you planning on - -
It's so strong!  Look at its nose.  Need help?
Why?  Oh, I'm sorry.  Are you two, uh - - are?  I wish you the best luck.
I didn't say I was scared.
When you gotta go, you gotta go.
Relatively.
I, uh, don't really know any.  We - -
Not to put a fine point on it, your kind.  Let's face it, in your particular field, you're the top minds.  If I could just get you two to sign off on the park - - you know, give a wee testimonial - - I could get back on schedule - -  - -schedule.
Sorry!  It's kind of a ride!
Shhh - - I'm right here, Lex.  I'm going to look after you.  I'm going to help your brother.  I want you to stay here and wait for me, okay?
Bet you'll never look at birds the same way again!
It's am easy catch, you let - - go - - you do the counting, you count it, Tim.  One, two, three -- you do all the counting, okay?
Codswollop!  Ian, you've never come close to explaining these concerns of yours about this island!
John, John.
I'll keep an eye on it.  Maybe it'll swing south like the last one.
Ray, start the tour program.
Sure.
That's what I said!  You're a nerd!  They don't call you people hackers anymore - - they call you people nerds!
Logging? We'll need an environmental impact study for that...
I don't think you're getting in the spirit of things, Janet. We'll buy whatever studies we need --
Get rid of them.
Great.
Janet, goddamnit, what's going on?
And we're in the center ring.  You sure you want to wear that blazer?
Fuck you.
What are the charges?
Video store?
Insomnia. Not unusual for someone in his situation.  Not to mention he's a bed-wetter.
One of the deputies is pretty cute. I think she likes me.
This sexual obsession of yours. Have you considered going into therapy yourself?
Well, Jason _was_ in a canoe accident in 1967 and presumed drowned. His mother died a few years later after a long bout with cancer. Some time in the early eighties, there were a string of murders out by Crystal Lake...  People started saying it was Jason... back from the dead.
It's a neurological disorder affecting the hypothalamus. The part of the brain that causes sleepiness is inactive. They didn't know about it back in the sixties. Even now, it's not understood very well.
If we could prove that Jason suffers from this disorder... and that his homicidal behavior has been a direct result of a medical condition...
Now.... according to the file, Krueger was burned to death in a fire in 1968. But get this -- beginning in 1984, there was _another_ series of murders in Springwood. All teenagers... all killed in their sleep... all killed with finger blades just like Krueger's.
Yeah, what is it?
Not yet.
I was there once... that was enough. Besides... I have to go out to Jason's house tomorrow.  They're... digging up some new evidence.
My client... is dead.  But I think he's a free man.
Yes -- that's us.
I haven't got the energy.  I mean, I have to conserve my energy.
If I don't see you later -- go to my house and find my notebooks -- and destroy them.  All my manuscripts -- just burn them. Please.
Who's to say he ever will?  He's a timid old man and quite careful not to tread on anyone's toes -- In fact, I'm the only one he trusts and he wouldn't even look at a document if it didn't first come through me.
Burgel, I thought it would be easier, as long as I was passing --
Your credibility -- yes, it's well known.
Yes.
It's what I'm paid to do.
In a small way.
One of you must be mistaken.
That he was -- satisfied in that regard.  I didn't want to pry.
He wasn't robbed.  He was identified by his wallet.
... All right.
You strike me as a man with a defined notion of injustice -- a high concern for the lot of your fellow men.  And yet you're able to remain an outsider.  With the concomitant air of ... superiority?
Burgel gave me this -- what does it mean?
He's jealous, yes, but <u>that</u> jealous?  He's too cautious.
And Burgel is the bringer of messages, isn't he?
I told you, they're <u>dead</u>.  It's finished.
-- Listen to me --
His landlady knew of no other friends to refer us to.
We know that.
... Just a perception.
I can't make a simple statement without him taking issue with it
It's all right to be sarcastic in private to us -- because we have a sense of humor -- but when we're up at the Castle we suggest you don't make a fuss.  It would spoil the not unfavorable impression you make in other respects.
When a scapegoat is needed, my friend ...
A mere slip.  Your friend Mr. Raban dealt only with claims that came <u>in</u>, another department being responsible for compensation that goes out -- this is correct?
... A piece of paper ...
Is your friend's name among them?  Then he only worked on the one case.  Your Chief will send me the final summation when he's finished with it.
It's not too bad working here.
Amerika!
There's nothing fast enough to catch that. Forget it. It's over.
When this boat finally reaches Jakata, I'll be first off. You'll never see me again ... and believe me - that day cannot come soon enough. I've got no problem with you ignoring me for the rest of the voyage.
Sun's coming up ...  We've been in the fog for six hours.
We're leaving.
Jack!...  Jack!
What a climax to the film - The first white men to set foot on ...  "Skull Island"  Twentieth Century man comes face to face with a ... a ... naked stone age tribe!
I tell you it doesn't exist!
I'm chartering this vessel,Engelhorn - how many days?
And I appreciate that so much, I really do - a sentiment that will be shared by audiences across America when they view my latest documentary sensation "Indonesia ...Hell Hole of the World". Ernie Hemmingway's agreed to write the narration. We're going out through Universal ... Laemmale's promised me fifteen hundred screens.
Native costume?
That's too bad.
A man eater! Fantastic!  Making history, Herb
What about him? Yes.
She was with you after she left Frank.
Yes?
Yes indeed.
Look. I almost killed my -- I almost killed someone.
Well we're pretty --
Is that what he set me up for? Everything he's told me from the beginning? -- don't worry, don't --
Grunemann? I've looked at him a --
-- We can talk --
No, you're frightened, you're pretending. Well -- Klute knows about me then. Does everybody know, can you tell me?
Miss Daniel? My name is Klute -- John Klute --
Mm.
If I was taking calls full time would I be living in this kip? I'd be back on Park Avenue; I could support the whole National Guard!
Nothing. Except he wasn't kidding. Usually it's a fakeout, you probably know. They pretend to tie you up, and you wear a dress with a cloth belt and they pretend to whip you or you --  Hell it's their money. I'll hang from the shower rod and whistle Maytime. Except this guy was really tripped out on it; he --
No thanks.
You asked me where I got that date with the dumper -- Frank sent me on it.
You told me what you could. I guess I'm through with your part of it.
Hey, but did we get to you, Klute? A little?
So you're not too different from him, or the chap on the roof, or Tommy-baby --
Well what're you down about? You mean because you didn't get me there?  You can't expect that. I mean Frank, yes, he'd get me there all the time -- but never with a John.
Then maybe Arlyn Page knew the Dumper too.
You could help me find her. You know the people.  I'll pay you a hundred dollars.
What the hell do you think's the matter.  I could wait for you someplace.
What?
I called Trina.
How do you know how bad it was?
Where, how?
I could try Arlyn Page again. She saw much more of the Dumper than Bree Daniel.
How is it back there?
Well there's a couple --
You were hired to look for Tom, not someone.
You were hired to look for Tom.
Will the Company put up five hundred dollars to get Jane McKenna's list of clients?
No, I'd -- like to be in on it.
I'll be sending you on a report tonight.
It's in the report.
Do they have the report? Have you discussed it with them?
All right. All right --  John, just sit tight will you? I'll read your report, I'll discuss it with the others. I'll be back next Thursday, we'll talk the whole thing over then. Nothing til Thursday, all right?
Goodbye, Pete.
I'd like to make something clear. I don't go after a girl; a girl comes to me. Her choice. Right?
I'd like to talk with Jane McKenna.
No. She had every good intention of it -- coming to me as a private patient, getting out of the life, devoting herself to an acting career.
Can you account for his disappearance in any way?
No.
He called this morning from Tuscarora. Asked me to meet him at 3:00 at the downtown heliport. He's on his way to Chicago.
Yeah.
We'd expect him to work in cooperation with you. He'd report to each of you and to our Company's New York office, to Pete -- Pete goes there on a regular schedule back and forth, and --
Oh, yes.  Won't you come in.
What does?
That's Kim...and this one's Thelma and that's Mrs. Willewska and this is daddy and that's Batman and over there is Robin.
Sure.  Didn't I ever tell you French toast was my specialty? I'll bet I never told you that. Now then, the first thing we need is...  ... eggs!  Right?
Uh huh...
That's not the right soap.  We use the kind in the green and yellow box.
I'm sorry.
That's okay.
No I didn't.  I hate the brown stuff.  It's gross.
It's my name too.
Did you watch "I Dream of Jeannie?"
Uh, uh...We didn't have television then.
I don't understand, daddy.
This is an isolated incident, counselor, unless you can prove otherwise.
The first couple, yes, but after that it became increasingly difficult.
Mrs. Kramer, did you ever work in a job while you were married to your ex-husband?
Yes.  Very much.
Call up the people at J. Walter Thompson.  Set up an appointment at four.
No.
How many lovers have you had-- permanently?
Okay, okay...What is it this time? What did I do now?...
I took two thousand out of the savings account.  That was what I had in the bank when we got married.
I'm listening, Joanna--believe me, I'm listening.  My wife is walking out on me after eight years of--
C'mon, Joanna, you don't mean that.  You're a terrific mother--
So do you.
Such as?
Joanna, what the hell is--
Beautiful.
Murray had some ideas about the Fire and Ice campaign and he had the art department make up a few roughs...  I think they're kind of interesting.
Well, ah...I thought it over and I decided we're doing it Murray's way.
Yes, I'll have dinner with you.
What?!?
Oh, for God's sake, Kramer. You have got to be the world's most naive human being.  Murray has gone in and changed every single ad you've done on the entire Fire and Ice campaign. Every layout...Every idea...Every single thing, right down the line.
I'm going to take it.
I lost him?  I lost him?
I can't tell you how sorry I am.
It's going to cost.
Six years.  Ever since Ted and Joanna moved into the building.
Ted, divorce is a terrible thing. I know, I went through it. You've got to believe I did everything I could to get Joanna to stay.  But I'll tell you something. You may not want to hear it, but it took a lot of courage for Joanna to do what she just did.
I'm gonna keep him, why?
All right...Okay...But let's get something straight, right now. I mean, I'm sorry about what happened between you and Joanna, but it's not my problem, understand?
I understand.
D'you think you and Charley'll ever get back together again?
No.  I don't think so.
Uh, huh...Yeah...
Ah, Charley and I are...Well, we're thinking about...I mean, actually we're sort of talking about maybe getting back together.
Yes, Holiness.
Tell me.
Are you, General?
We did not.
Yes. A cow had died. One night, you stopped all your moving, and I said to your sister, "His time has come."
No. Not very big.
You are the man who wrote this letter. You are the man who has come back to lead us. You will soon have great responsibilities. You must know what to do.
America, we shall see.
In the Americas.
My first and foremost duty is to protect my people. I feel sure of this. And, things change. Maybe not right away, maybe not soon. But I believe this -- things will change.
Non-violence means co-operation when it is possible. Resistance, when it is not.
I will alert the Chinese delegation. You know, I would never have let you go alone, Kundun.
Please, come in, so cold.
Good. Very good. Tibet is a great country. A wonderful history. Long ago, you even conquered part of China. But now you have fallen behind and we want to help you. In twenty years time you could be ahead of us. Then it will be your turn to help China.
But you will always be here?
I am braver.
It is a story, you decide.
But, surely, we are safe in Tibet. We don't believe in killing.
Ahh.
Ahh.
Am I running away?
The people will cry when they learn you are gone. But they would all want you safe.
You have grown up very good.
They think they have convinced me. They think I am on their side. They have allowed me to leave Kumbum and come to Lhasa believing that I will try to turn you to their ways. If I do not succeed, I am to eliminate you.
How could I ever leave?
The land has stayed in the family. We work together. The nobleman is not too bad.
You're all fuckers.  Vicious little fuckers.
The <u>reason</u> I lied is if I'd told you the truth, you'd just hunt it down and kill it which seems to be exactly what you're doing.
Thank you, Officer Fuckmeat.
I do <u>not</u> like you.
Deep down, gut check.  I'm growing fond of <u>you</u> and it's liberating to say so.
A spring trap!
Crocodiles don't sever with their teeth, their molars are blunt.
What I'm saying is <u>if</u> it's a crocodile that cut a man in half he would have to be over twenty feet which would make him well over a hundred years old, it would be unthinkable to destroy him.
Whenever somebody dies I consider it such a waste that I didn't know him better.
Obviously some asshole in Hong Kong flushed him down a toilet.
Is everything a big fucking joke to you?
I'm tired, Hector.  I know this because you're beginning to not bug me.
That <u>sounds</u> good but underneath it's hurtful.  Nightcap?
Raincheck.
I don't know!
We both know what they'll do.
You do?
Women's intuition.  Are there anymore?
Even so, you're allowed to boast. You look thin by the way, I've mentally undressed you, I can see your ribcage.
I'm a civilian!  You don't have any authority--
Excuse me?
Oh, bullshit.
Eh.  Fuck it.
Never been to Maine before?
You don't like tents, mosquitos, look at your fingernails, you have about as much business being in the woods--
<u>Something's</u> in that water.
Adult males will charge hatchlings. If there's one out there...
Because they just consult their little indigenous charts.
When you get scared, the brain releases a chemical, same chemical it releases when somebody's...  in high school, the thing to do was to take the girl to a scary movie.
Forgive me for trying to be nice.
Let's get away from the shore.
<u>No</u>.  I keep getting hit with heads!
Keep firing!
No.
Doesn't <u>look</u> like it.
Obviously I was wrong!
So does he.
<u>You</u> <u>gotta</u> <u>be</u> <u>kidding</u>.
Other than to eat us?
<u>There</u>?  That's the morgue.
And this is how he came to the boat?
I got nothing against--
I just let go of it.
I don't know.  It was like a tug. Something tugged us.
Other than feeling slightly embarrassed, I'm perfectly fine.  Could you cut me down?
This is business.  There was an accident in Maine, some guy got killed by something in a lake.  Probably a bear, but... they found a tooth.
I'm not going to Maine, I won't even go west of Forty-third Street--
It started <u>before</u> you, Kelly, I never would've--
Stay cool. Just remember to call him "God."
Why not?
But why? He didn't weight the others.
Some fishermen in West Virginia found an unidentified girl's body. It's a Buffalo Bill-type situation. Been in the water about a week, and Jack needs somebody that can print a floater. Think you can handle it?
He's got a lot on his mind besides Buffalo Bill... His wife, Bella, is real sick. Comatose... I'm tellin' you about it now, 'cause he may never.
Safe, SHIT, he's got a gun! Getmeout. GET ME OUT!
Shut UP!  The other officers will be here any minute! you're perfectly safe now!
Mr. Gordon, did you know Fredrica when she worked for Mrs. Lippman?
I think we may be, yes.
Not yet.
Be very careful with Hannibal Lecter. Dr. Chilton at the asylum will go over the physical procedures used with him. Do not deviate from them, for any reason. You tell him nothing personal, Starling. Believe me, you don't want Hannibal Lecter inside your head... Just do your job, but never forget what he is.
There's no correlation at all between where they're kidnapped and where they're found...?  What if - what if you trace the heaviest-traffic routes backwards from the dump sites? Do they converge at all?
He's a white male... Serial killers tend to hunt within their own ethnic group. And he's not a drifter - he's got his own house, somewhere. Not an apartment.
He starts this - buzzing in me, in my head. He makes me feel violated... You used me, Mr. Crawford.
It matters, Mr. Crawford... Other cops know who you are. They look at you to see how to act... It matters.
You do until six p.m.
Starling, we know who he is! And where he is. We're on our way now.
Johns Hopkins finally came up with a name for us. We fed him into Known Offenders, and he came up cherries.  Subject's name is "Jamie Gumb," AKA "John Grant." Lecter's description was accurate, he just lied about the name.
It's much better than your shoes.
I have no doubt of it.
All flayed...?
I didn't.
A census taker once tried to test me. I ate his liver with some fava beans and a nice chianti... Fly back to school, little Starling.
Why don't you ask me about Buffalo Bill?
Why don't you tell me about "Miss Mofet?" You wanted me to find him. Or do I have to wait for the lab?
Jack Crawford is helping your career, isn't he? Apparently he likes you. And you like him, too.
That's just part of the island. It has a very nice beach. Terns nest there.
Killed outright?
Dr. Lecter, there's no correlation in the literature between transsexualism and violence. Transsexuals are very passive.
I went to live with my mother's cousin and her husband in Montana. They had a ranch.
No! That's incidental.
What was it?
Tell me his name, Dr. Lecter.
Promise...?  Then why not take your case file? I won't be needing it anymore.
Well, Clarice, have the lambs stopped screaming...?
I doubt very much that the FBI or any other government agency can keep a secret, Mr. Crawford. Truth will out... And then what? Will you give Johns Hopkins a new identity? Put a big pair of sunglasses on this building, and a funny nose?
Would you, Doctor? That would be so kind.
You have my word. Paul?
Toughened your nipples, didn't it...?  Six foot one, strongly built, about 190 pounds. Hair brown, eyes pale blue. He'd be about 35 now. He said he lived in Philadelphia, but may have lied. That's really all I can remember, Senator - but if I think of any more, I'll let you know.
Thank you, Doctor. I'll keep it in mind.
He did?
What?!
Yes. And "do not try to understand them.  That is because they are a breed apart and they make no sense..."
Thank you so much.
I'm sorry.
And what were the consequentialities of European culture you didn't bother with?
'Cos frontier land's the only land affordable to poor people. So after seven years indentured service in Virginia, they headed out here where they are beholden to none and not livin' by another's leave...  Their name was Cameron. John & Alexandria.
On the contrary. It is more deeply stirring...  to my blood...  ...than any imagining could possibly have been...
Top of this ridge. Fort and Lake George are downhill of it.
Miss.  May I?
When? How?
You do not know what you are saying!
Yes I do! I know exactly what I am saying.  And if it is sedition, then I am guilty of sedition, too!
Then we take the south rim down the mountain and it's 12 miles cross country to Fort Edward.
Will you men help us stop the French?
... and while they are cooped up in your fort, what if the French send war parties to raid their homes?
Tradin' your skins in Castleton?
Our father, Montcalm, is greater than the Yengeese in the arts of war. The Huron do not fear English anger.
Wise one, the French fathers made peace and swore to their honor not to break the friendship. Magua broke it. It is false that the French would not be friends, still, to the Huron.
You forget yourself!
Yes, sir.
And who empowered these provincials to pass judgment upon England's policies in her own colonies? To come and go without so much as a "by your leave."
General Webb can burn in hell. We'll go back and dig our graves behind the ramparts! Our mission is to fight.
Sir!  Upon the center, wheel to the left- about!  March!  Rear ranks, proper distance!  Front ranks, take your distance! March!  Halt!  Make ready! 
Sir!!!  Third rank! Twelve paces! Forward march!
Excuse me. What did you say?
Wampum?
Yengeese Major give all property to Magua.  Magua give Yengeese Major much wampum, many gifts, maybe three, four oxen.
Yes.
Chingachgook's of the same opinion. Taken together, that's gospel. Your fort will stand or fall depending on Webb and reinforcements, not these colonials' presence.
I judge military matters, Captain Winthrop, not you.
Does the rule of English law no longer govern?  Has it been replaced by absolutism?
And this?
Monsieur le Marquis, I am a soldier, not a diplomat. You called this parlay for a reason.
Perhaps the General's glasses can reach to the Hudson and he knows the size and imminence of the army of Webb...?
Granted.
La victoire.
C'est bien, vous vous promenez bien matin, monsieur!
What mistakes?  Look, I think it's no big deal but if you want to find out why this ship sank have Maritime run a check.
It was when it counted a couple of million years ago when the seas came in and drove us into the water.  Most homo sapiens didn't make it...Danakil man... <u>adapted</u>.
Stay calm!
Uh, oh...I see where this is going...
Were, Doss <u>were</u>.
Think!  Can we stop it?! Block it up?!  Shut down the line somewhere?!  Think!
I am thinking, man!  You think I want to die!  I am thinking!  I--
Huh?  I...uh...uh...
What?
Today...with DeJesus.  That was smart thinking to get him inside...
Still...you did the right thing.
You screw around like that again and--
How much time does that give us?
Less than an hour.  It's ruptured an air duct.
Twenty minutes...
Don't thank me, yet, but it is important to know where you're going and who your friends are... 'Know what I mean?
But you don't have any proof at this point to assume that this disease is contagious, do you?
I realize you must have gone through hell--
Not yet.
Russian.
Shhhh...don't tell no one.  Job security.
What?  That?...I've done this one before.  You hungry?  I'm hungry.
No fuckin' lie...
Sixpack...
Fucking great...You telling me we got a fucking dracula in here with us?
Who's the best power forward in the NBA...Jameson?
Jameson?  Who are you trying to con...?
Hardly.
Stop fucking around, Tom, and think. What are we going to do?
I would rather put my money on a three-legged rocking horse. The odds are a hundred to one for a good reason, BACON . . . it won't win. So where is Ed with all the bright ideas?
Think about what you're going to say, Ed; we are on thin ice.
You want a pint, go to the pub.
I thought this was a pub.
You get the guns?
There were two old guns there; where are they?
Good, you can get this under control now.
Er, yeah, sure, I'll have 'em.
Sure is.
Furry muff, let's go.
In fact it is a little more than a bit of a problem, isn't it? You could say that in the scale of these things this is the Mount fucking Everest of problems, couldn't you? . . . And the reason it is such a mon fucking-strosity of a problem is because you don't have the first fucking idea who did this to us, do you?
Shit, Dog, there's a lot. Don't you want to do this next door?
No.
Just give me the keys.
What the fuck is going on?
Out the back.
Bacon, the fat man and myself, and it's time to make a call to Harry.
Why, what's up?
I'll only be a minute.
And you do have a reputation, so I'll choose my words carefully. But not to put too fine a point on it, fuck yourself, Harry!
What are you doing, Plank?
Bloody hell, Tom! This is a bit heavy. This is London, not the Lebanon' Who do you think I am?
Get your fingers out of my soup!
What about all the gear?
Er, well, twelve.
We need fertilizer, Winston.
So?
They're not going to jail.
Just some rich Anglo out on the lake. Don't even live here all year.
I am, sir.
The--the officers.
It's their country. This is one of the best deals they offer.
I mean, follow orders, sir.
You're dismissed, Private.
You got a cause of death?
I roust some muchacho on the street, doesn't have his papers, all he got to say is "Yo trabajo para Jimmy Herrera."
There's gonna be some left over for you, Buddy. I take care of my boys.
You do whatever I say you do or else you put it on the trail, son.
Who said anything about shootin' anybody?
No, you look good. I was just wondering.
--and that squeaker the Aggies dropped to Oklahoma-sonofabitch stepped in some lucky shit before he kicked that goal--
It wasn't just you, Bunny.
Come on in--
Otis went on like you were that guy who won the Gulf War. Colin whatsit.
Go out through the back.
Both.
That guy who got shot--
PDA?
Public Display of Affection. Every time he moves up a rank, it's like he's got to tighten the screws a little more--
So I'm part-Indian?
My father says the day you're  born you start from scratch, no breaks and no excuses, and you got to pull yourself up on your own.
Good.
Cool.
It's a lead mine.
Right.
You finding lots of cactus and shit?
Maybe.
Priscilla says they think any woman over 30 who isn't married must be a lesbian. She figures they'll be so relieved I'm a man--
Mikey--
Seriously, I think we should get married.
I'd quit the Army for you, if it came to that.
Masons been around a long while.
Have we had trouble there before?
Deal drugs in the bathroom--
So tell me why I shouldn't make this place off-limits.
Right.
This same person been bragging all over the county how he don't have to cut that big gringo Sheriff in on it-- he can run his own operation 'thout any help. Como se llama, amigo?
Eladio Cruz.
Si--tengo escopeto--just a shotgun--
Soy yo, Enrique! No tiene miedo-- [It's me, Enrique. Don't be afraid]
Donde vamos? [Where are we going?]
He was a unique individual.
That's not the whole story. The Mexicans that know, that remember, understand what Buddy was for their people.  Hell, it was Mercedes over there who swung the deciding vote for him.
Not a peep. Buddy run the man out of town.
Sam! Hey podner! You caught me playing hooky--
There's no call for that, Sam. Fella made himself a pile of enemies over the years.
Do you?
Hey, Sam.
Widow's benefits. He figured it would make the disappearance look better, and that Mexican gal was just scrapin' by after Charley killed her man. They didn't get hooked up till late--
He agreed it wasn't exactly news--
Steve. Board of Education Steve who likes you? He goes for us hot-blooded Mexican girls, I can tell.
You got to be interested in somebody. All you do is work.
Nobody is illegal in my cafe! They've got green cards, they've got relatives who were born here--if they only had a little common sense I'd be very happy.
If you spent a little more time training them--
He was killed.
Thank you.
I never said that. It was just that boy--
I'm Sheriff Deeds--
You mind if I ask a few questions about your husband? Roderick?
Yeah. How about that? People start digging holes in this county, there's no telling what'll come up.
What?
What do you think?
Nobody really wears that stuff, Paloma.
I only went for my last two years.
You've got your mother, your kids--
Yeah.
I mean what did we know about anything?
Yeah?
Okay--we'll take a statement from all the GIs before they go back to post. You can get the story from Otis over at the club.
Uh-huh.
You'd do a good job.
Well, it's a complicated issue--
We had about a dozen wets come over just upriver. They ran into one of our posts--it was like a breakshot on a pool table, illegals runnin' every which way.
I heard about that deal for your father--You must be real proud.
So? What's he gonna do, arrest us?
Hey, anytime.  Actually, no.  This was enough.
Isn't that French for something?
What do you mean, "all of us?"
Death.
You'll do more.than that.
Why did you wait so long?
You don't?
We don't share our lives the way a lot of people do.
Come to the show with me. Tonight I want you to see him with an audience.  They love him.
Why don't you tell me the truth?
And they all came...
Find Valentin!  Find him!  Get him in here!
Nix has got to have a weak spot. Everybody's got a fucking weak spot.
I... have... to.
Good.  There.  Yes?
Somebody killed him.
No.  I'm saying they were always fake.  The saints, the messiahs, they were just illusionists.
Evil.  He was evil.  Come on.
We've never met.
Have you got a job that'll pay you five thousand a day?
I saw him in Vegas once.
Looking for you.  I tried the hotel.
You're a detective, with no clues. Where else are you going to look? I'm going to keep this brief.  Here's thirty thousand dollars.
Left alone?  Somebody's been murdered.
We've got to get you to a hospital.
Don't bother.
Shut up.  We've lost enough lives already.
What about?
Does anybody?
Too late.  Why are you here? Did you cone... up here for a reading?
The Puritan?
It's not a business. Harry. It's a vocation.
Now I'm going to have to kill you.
I don't think so.  You need me alive.
Oh yeah?
Help me.
Will that do?  No?
I can do a lot of shit, D'Amour. But you know that.  So I like playing games with people.  Gives them something to wonder about...
And he didn't have them?
And you believed him?
Who else did?  Did Valentin?
He's better off this way.
I don't know.
Swann?
No.  He's coming back.  He's digging his way out!
But until then... it's you and me... the way it always was.
Yeah, they told me.
Bob, it's me.
Oh.
What did you study?
Oh, what do you do with that?
See you later.
I know. I don't either.
Thanks for getting me back in one piece.
But the first time I saw you was in the elevator.
Oh.
I know, but that's what you like about me.
Because that would be too easy.
Working.
Yeah.
Well, I mean it more now.
That'd be great.
That sounds great  can you hold on...  What Zoe?
I don't know... I want to be more healthy. I want to eat better.
Not all that pasta.
I couldn't hear you. How are you?
Fine. Is it going ok?
Do you want to- 
Bye.
Mr. Harris, we have fax for you!
I went to a temple today and I didn't feel anything.
Mmm, I love Cristal, let's have some.
I'm just here shooting this band, what about you?
Promoting that action movie I did...
Hmmm.
Forgot my car keys.  What are you doing on the fourth floor?
I'm just temporarily off my game.
I thought the spare set was in the kitchen drawer.
So you're going to kill her?  Put the gun down Claire.
Not the guards.  Some of the prisoners are easily disturbed.
No, I wasn't, actually.
It's the patient's request, doctor.
Father, I have nowhere else to stay.
You have a sister in New Orleans.
Peter.  Your life must matter to you because it matters to all of us who love you.
You know, I respect that you have such faith, James.  I don't understand it, but I want you to know that despite our differences, I admire you and I always will.
Just open the door, please.
So, if Christ won, that means, what does that mean, Father?  That Satan...
Peter Kelson?
I saw you on television yesterday.  You were brilliant.
Well, by saying that, you're acknowledging the existence of a higher power.  Which, to a narcissist, is impossible.
Last week the Catholic Church certified him as genuinely possessed.  You realize how rarely they make that ruling?
An exorcism was just held for Birdson. It failed.  Disastrously.  Which means there's still a demonic spirit present in his body.  I was wondering, perhaps you'd like to go meet Henry.  He's pretty amazing.
What do you mean?
And this is evil?  The guy had an aneurysm and now he's in a coma.
Townsend believed, just as God became man in Christ.  So Satan will assume human form.  I believe it too.
I know this sounds crazy.  I understand. Check your parents' blood types.  Are you sure your parents are your birth parents?
But I was baptized.  And I certainly wasn't born of incest.
Yes.
The books themselves or maybe some pages he ripped out.
Until it happens, you're still a human being.
Only your body will remain.  I believe your soul will be at peace.  If we kill you, Satan can't stay.
That's his, I don't know, his 'grounding' phrase for me, "together, no matter what."
The police used him as a witness in this case.
Well, long-term exposure to things like this tends to give you a sort of clinical understanding of the subject. After awhile, you begin to make friends with it, so to speak.
Meaning, Viznick's a man who answers to no one.  Not even God.
And what about you?  What about Peter Kelson?  Where is your moral compass?
Yeah, right.  I don't know why I bothered inviting you guys.  I knew you wouldn't show.
So you can see where you're going when you crawl up his asshole.
Maybe she is.
No I don't.
So you're angry with me because you're standing here with your hair combed and wearing perfume?
Camille, she'll be fine.
The blue.
I just need to lay down.  I've been running around all day.
I thought Sidra's ankle was okay for next game.
Oh, sorry.
Kyra, this is Monica.  She, uh...
Four days.
You might be the only one with a job.
You're just scared.  I know rehab is hard, and you have to worry about whether you'll be as good as you were but you will be.  I believe in you.  You just have to get back on the court.  Like you'd get back on a horse.
Yeah, once I cut them off.  Why?
You lost your head.
So how's the job going?
Just like that?
Well, if anybody bothers you, you could just tell me cause I run this street.
I'd just tell my sister, Lena.
I guess, you know, we play ball and we ride to school together.  And if you get mad at me, I gotta give you flowers.
I don't like flowers.
You're stupid.  And your Daddy plays for the worst team in the NBA.
I know this.  What do you want?
Your legs don't look broke.
I don't.
Who's Spalding?
Who said I'm not getting recruited?
I mean it, give it your best shot, cause I'm tired of you holding that over my head.
Yeah.
He ain't Spalding.
Figures.
You had four offensive rebounds.
You sure?
I know, right?
Quit.
The "man" again.
We're going to get some food.
What, "Q-man", did I forget to kiss your ass like everybody else?
Thanks.
Strong enough to get you down the aisle?
It's a trip, you know?  When you're a kid, you see the life you want, and it never crosses your mind that it's not gonna turn out that way.
So why'd you give up ball?
From basketball.
What's that supposed to be, psychology?
Well, can you give him this for me?
Keep your voice down.
The doctor'll be back in a minute.
Later when?
That's right.
I don't wanna hurt your feelings.
Well, tell them to mind their damn business.  You're smart enough to get a degree.
No, you need to hear me say it, I'll say it.  It's not true.
Look, I ain't saying it was right, but sometimes things happen.
You want me to fuck off?
Fine, I'll fuck off, but not til I say something.
THAT'S NONE OF YOUR BUSSINESS. I HAVE BEEN A GOOD WORKER, A GOOD AND LOYAL WORKER FOR YOU, YOU FUCKING ASSHOLE.
And the book says: "We may by through with the past, but the past ain't through with us."
Well I don't want to order anything, you see. I have a situation, a situation just come up that's really pretty serious and I'm not sure who I should talk to or what I should do but could you maybe put me in touch with the right person if I explain myself?
Well what's the situation?
Well, ok.  Lemme see how I explain this without it seeming kinda crazy, but here go:  I'm, my name is Phil Parma and I work for a man named Earl Partridge -- Mr. Earl Partidge. I'm his nurse.  He's a very sick man. He's a dying man and he's sick and he's asked me to help him, to help him find his son -- Hello?  Are you there, hello?
I know -- and I can't really explain that, but I have a feeling there's something, some situation between them, like they don't really know each other much or well, something like they don't talk much anymore --
Uh-huh.
Does this sound weird?
My mother had breast cancer.
I'M NOT CRAZY.  You're the one.  You're the one who's wrong.  You're the one --
LAPD. Open the door.
I'm coming!
Ok. For one thing, we're gonna need to turn that music down so we can talk, ok?
I didn't realize it was that loud.
Bit messy.
You and your boyfriend have a party last night?
Yeah...it's not...it's been on for a bit --
That'd be fine.  So, Claudia, lemme just say, so I can get my role of LAPD officer out of the way before we enjoy our coffee  I'm not gonna write you up or anything, I'm not gonna give you a citation here -- but the real problem we have is that there are people around here, people that work from their homes, people tryin' to get some work done, and if you're listenin' to your music that loud:  They're incovenienced by that.  If you had a job you'd probably understand, but I see you like listenin' to your music and that's fine, you're just gonna wanna keep it down at a certain volume, maybe memorize what number you see on the dial and just always put it to that -- If it's the middle of the day -- that's what I do -- just put it on two and a half and that's a good listening level, alright? I see you like listenin' to your music loud, but, hey, forget about the neighbors, you end up damaging your own ears ok?
Yeah.
Just Jim.
Please, yes.
Then...I'd like to go...What do you want to do?
I thought you were flirting with me a little.
I've never found someone really that I think I would like to go out with.
What I just said...y'know, people afraid to say things....no guts to say the things that they...that are real or something...
To not do that.  To not do that that we've maybe done -- before --
Ok.  I'll tell you everything and you tell me everything and maybe we can get through all the piss and shit and lies that kill other people....
I'm sorry.
That felt good to do...to do what I wanted to do.
Yeah.
-- no, like what, what do you mean?
BULLSHIT. BULLSHIT, DAD WE NEED TO GET HIS MONEY AND GO.
Son, please, now....
Please, boy, put it down and it's ok.
I'm a rapper.
C'mon, man, just watch me, watch and listen --
Yeah, I'm here, I'm off the elevator, walking down the hall, now --
I have love.
You mind your own bussines.
"It's a dangerous thing to confuse chidlren with angels..."
-- and you wanna know the common element for the entire group, like he asks...I'll tell you the answer: I'll tell you, 'cause I had that question.  I had that same question....Carbon. In pencil led, it's in the form of graphite and in coal, it's all mixed up with other impurities and in the diamond it's in hard form.  "Well...all we were asking was the common element, Donnie...but thank you for all that unnecessary knowledge...ahhh, Kids!  Full of useless thoughts, eh?"  Thank you. Thank you.  And the book says: "We may be through with the past but the past is not through with us."  And NO IT'S NOT DANGEROUS TO DO THAT.
-- I give you money, I give you a paycheck. Your sales suck, Don. I give, I give. When I find you, when I meet you, what? I put you on the billboard, I put you in the store, my salesman, my fucking representation of Solomon and Solomon Electronic, Quiz Kid Donnie Smith from the game show --
FUCK YOU.  I pay you, I paid you. I give you a fucking chance and a chance and over and over, over you let me down.  I trust you with so much. The keys to my store, the codes to my locks, the life, the blood of my bussiness and return is smashing in seven-eleven, late, <u>always</u> late, loans -- I loaned you money for your kitchen that you never did --
Your teeth are fine.
It's...doesn't matter....
She loves you.
Other fuckin' assholes like me.
...gimme that fuckin' phone...
Who?
Yep.
Are we gonna tape some stuff now?
Just one look, one hesitation, one subtle gesture for me to know -- And Bing-Bam-Boom I'm away on a tangent -- I get so fuckin' amped at these seminars and lemme tell you why: Because I Am What I Believe. I am what I teach, I do as I say, I live by these rules as religiously as I preach them: And you wanna know what? I'm gettin' pussy left, right, up, down, center and sideways.
Like I said, yeah --
Let's talk about --
-- let's talk more about your background --
Thank you, Muffy.  Funny thing is: This is an important element of, "Seduce and Destory:" "Facing the past is an important way in not making progress," that's something I tell my men over and over --
Not really.
This is how you wanna spend the time, then go, go, go -- you're gonna be surprised at what a waste it is -- "The most useless thing in the world is that which is behind me," Chapter Three --
I'm not sure I hear a question in there?
She's retired.
And your father?
...this close...
Oh, yeah.  No, no, no.  They wouldn't --
no, no, no.  Certainly not.  I wasn't officialy enrolled, that's right. Was that unclear?
Yeah. I was trying to get in touch with you.  We got dissconnected.
These Dogs'll calm down -- you just have to come in --
Yeah.
Can you stand...back...maybe, I mean... just a little bit...in the room is ok, but back from us a little...
I got a call to this apartment, report of a disturbance --
Been drinkin' today?
I'm a bad person.
Yeah.
No.
Just once.
How long with Paula?
Two years...three years...
I don't know....
I'm not mad.  I am, but I'm not.  Y'know?
But you can't say....
Yes you do.
You should know better.
You're her boyfriend?
No.  But I probably will get a call back.
I'll get it because I'm a good actress, Richard.
Saucy-saucy.
Movie Of The Week.  I went up for one this morning with Alan Thicke and Corey Haim --
What kind of medication are you on right now, Linda that's --
Adultery isn't illegal -- it's not something that can be used in a court to discredit the will or -- Linda. Linda. Calm down.
BULLSHIT. BULLSHIT HE DIDN'T ASK YOU, HE DOESN'T WANT HIM, HE DOESN'T WANT TO TALK TO HIM, SO FUCK YOU THAT HE ASKED THAT. THERE IS NO ONE BUT ME AND HIM.
Yeah.
Yeah.
I'm sick of being the one, the one who always has to do everything, I don't want to be the one always --
I need this one.
Go to bed.
Go to bed.
Hi.
It's not right.
...what...?
I understand you saved my son's life today.
We haven't visited in three years. And we should have privacy.
He is dead!  By God's choice!  There is nothing to discuss.
No, Louis!  No!
Next week.  This is a mere garden party -- and I wish to join it, so I will be brief.  I am experiencing resistance from the Jesuits.
I see that is a body!  But where did you get it?
You are not my priest, Aramis!  You would not be, even if I had one.
He's threatened to do it, it's been building up in him for months.
Perhaps he serves a different king.
Pull them back!
I just said you're praying!  Are you deaf too?  I know you're blind, because if you had seen the tits that just walked out of here, you'd have tears in your eyes.
Forgiveness?
I remember that night.  D'Artagnan was drunk, the only time I've seen him that way.  The three of us were reveling, remember, Athos?
The child of the king is... the king.  Louis!
No, not Louis!
None of the ladies will be able to take their eyes off you.
She died giving you to me.  And I want to die knowing it is one the finger of the women my son loves.
Michelle cannot possibly accept!
I have rejoined the army, and asked to resume my commission at the head of the troops of General Fromberge.
Fromberge...?!  At the front?!  No.
Midnight!  Mon dieu!  Driving the youngsters hard, eh?
If the young woman truly loves Raoul --
I know.
Why do you follow him, d'Artagnan?! I know you have put service above your own life, but why does this King deserve such loyalty?  He is a monster!  He executes ministers for his own blunders, with their families hostage so they take the blame!  He has no honor!
It is something I have done -- or did not do.
Who came?
It... was nothing.  A nightmare, nothing more.  Go away, I --
It shall be done, your Majesty.
Eh?
Sire, I --
Oh Louis, Louis...
We'll burn in hell.  Both of us.
Every step of the way.
It happened too fast.  He was in the back, quiet and calm and boom! He was out - and gone.  We...we fanned out...Stanton must have let his guard down!
Fine -
Nineteen eighty four.  What fucking difference does it make?
Mm-hmm...that's not what the bartender told us.
Alright, alright!  We were just fucking with him..you know?
Yeah?
Seattle.
You got any family?
You'll find out - soon enough.
So you know about Marvosa, and Stanton, and all of them.
Jim Trudell!  Bravo company!
Well...whatsamatter?  Run in with the law?
Jesus, man...
They're inside the department, they're everywhere - it's not safe.
Both at the same bank...
Shit, we just started.  But I better log out of this.
He doesn't think you run mind games on him.
I wouldn't presume to try.
He's an eideteker. He has almost total recall.  But I don't think he's psychic.  What he has it empathy and projection.  He can assume your point of view and mine.., and some other points of view that scare and sicken him.
That's when it happened?
He'd know it from articles he's read about Lecktor...
Library of Congress.
Nobody's better with evidence. But he has the other thing, too. He doesn't like that part of it...
You wouldn't like it, either if you had it.
Typed him from semen. He's a secretor.
What do you want to do?
We're running it through the computers now. So far there's no event or service that doubles back into both families. Plus they were big consumers: snowmobiles, fishing trips, scuba, videogames, lots of routine medical and dental. It's a haystack.  What's the other?
...there's three 't's' and an 'r' in Tattler.
It says: 'Graham home, 3860 DeSoto Highway, Marathon, Florida. Save yourself. Kill them all.  It's your home address, Will. The bastard gave him your home address.
From the lip wound, which happened seven hours before he got burned, we've narrowed it down to those cities within the seven-hour driving radius that also would've caught the 'Tattler' early Tuesday morning.
Let's admit we struck out this month. The Gulf Stream's standing by. The basic lab stuff is on it.  You, Zeller, Jimmie Price, a photographer. Anywhere he hits, we can be there in an hour and fifteen minutes. We get the call, we roll. The scene'll be very fresh...
Will. Get right back here. He just called.
He went to the men's room.
Shooting at maybe eight feet. I can't use any lights.
In eight days.
Dandridge is a condescending prick. Ride with me. It would be because I want you to.
You know you speak very well, although you avoid fricatives and sibilants in your speech. At the Riker Institute for the Blind. I trained in speech therapy for speech and hearing impaired children...
I'm fine.
No, Mr. Lounds. You'll be just fine.
Let me lie down.  Listen, I want to call my office. My God, I'm in a Stryker frame.  My back's broken. Tell me the truth.
Yes.
Mr. Lounds, you're a reporter.  You're here to titillate your readers. If you don't open your eyes, I'll staple your eyelids to your forehead.
Yes...
Not me.
Yes.
Do you imply that I'm a queer?
I might have to show him some material that could stimulate him.
Well, it's about goddamn time!  I have a note here, or two pieces of a note, that appears to be from the man who killed those people in Atlanta and....
Yeah...
3680 DeSoto Highway. Marathon, Florida.
Why do you think I called?
I get a lot of calls. Most of them are from people who say they know things.
Why do you think he took his gloves off?
What happened to them?
You mended a crack in the wallpaper with your diploma.  You are open and easy now... It took you a lot of work to get to that...
What you've already decided. You're not really asking.
At the store. You doin' some good?
Yeah. Ah... yellow, let's paint it yellow.
Good for him.  Thanks a lot, Freddie!  Kevin. We're going grocery shopping.
My grandboy's been eatin' a ton of breakfast every day. Been out riding. Must be the good air. You oughta see that little booger eat.  I'll bet he's gained ten pounds.  Molly's out in the motor home...
Go on to the house...
I can't thank you enough, I...
Barry's mom had this newspaper. It said you killed the guy in Minnesota and were in a mental hospital. Is it true?
Are you gonna kill him?
No.
And?
Yes.
In the papers. I don't tear out the articles.  I wouldn't want them to think I was dwelling on anything morbid. You want to know how he's choosing them, don't you?
I thought you would have some ideas.
You had disadvantages.
Because, my dear Will, if this Pilgrim imagines he has a relationship with the full moon, he might go outside and look at it.  Have you seen blood in moonlight, Will? It appears quite black. If one were nude, it would be better to have outdoor privacy for this sort of thing.
May I keep the file?
Why does it feel good?
I'm not a comedian.  I have no talent.  I'm a song-and-dance man.
I'm -- Fonzie? GEORGE NO!  The Fonzie!  The crazy breakout character!  The guy that all the kids impersonate and put on their lunchboxes!
No to the whole thing.  None of it sounds good.
What's up?
Tell you what.  I'll book you on some concerts, and meanwhile, we'll show the Special around... see if somebody wants to buy it --
Yeah, we can have a garage sale. "Hey look, I got a floor lamp and a network TV Special for only fifty cents!"
Okay... I'll go back.  But just let them know, first they ain't gettin' Latka.  They're gettin' Tony!
WRONG!  You haven't given them any clues that it's a parody!
Andy!  You don't get it!  They don't want you back.
It's visualization therapy.  He's helping me turn inward and fight the disease.
Of course!  But that doesn't mean I don't need everyone's support!  I can't be surrounded by negative energy.
Yeah...
You're firing me??  You don't even pay me!
Oh!
Ten.
Hey, I love movie theater popcorn... but that doesn't mean I have to sit through "On Golden Pond."
Hi... am I late?
They don't know... they've gotta run more tests.
Have you told your family?
No!  Andy, don't do it --
Nah.  The girls sponge off between johns.
Sure, because your new stuff's a bunch of crap.  Kaufman, people are sick of you.  The wrestling... the hoaxes...
No!  NO NO NO!  None of that!  I want this show to be positive!
I stopped drinking.  I gave up drugs.  And I'm meditating three hours a day.  It's the center of my life...
Yes, your Holiness?
It is apparently not working.
Eh, sure.  We're trying to expand our audience base -- and I know the college kids really love Andy Kaufman.
He said he's coming back!
He'll be contacting us again.
It's already begun.
Two grand.
I don't know... My computer...
Don't tell me you're a believer now?
Gee-zus!  What a mindfuck.  You're here to save the world.  You gotta be shitting me.  What do you say to something like that?
Really?
Five.  Since I've been here.
How do you know all this?
What do you know?
Because I don't like the idea that I'm not in control of my life.
This can't be...
Be what?  Be real?
Far from it.
Yes.  A singular consciousness that spawned an entire race of machines. I must say I find it almost funny to imagine the world slapping itself on the back, toasting the new age.  I say almost funny.
Yeah.
Don't think of it in terms of right and wrong.  She is a guide, Neo. She can help you find the path.
Yeah?  What about the other five guys?  The five before me?  What about them?
Do it!
Honestly?  I don't know.
Morpheus.  He almost had me convinced.
That was a long time ago.
From what?
It disables any electrical system in the blast radius.  It's the only weapon we have against the machines.
But an Oracle can.
No.
... right as rain.
A black cat went past us and then I saw another that looked just like it.
It might have been.  I'm not sure.
Is Morpheus still alive, Tank?
I'm not the One, Trinity.  The Oracle hit me with that too.
No, you're not.
No?  Let me tell you what I believe. I believe Morpheus means more to me than he does to you.  I believe that if you are serious about saving him then you are going to need my help and since I am the ranking officer on this ship, if you don't like it then I believe that you can go to hell, because you aren't going anywhere else.
You moved like they moved.  I've never seen anyone move that fast.
No.
Deep underground.  Near the earth's core, where it's still warm.  You live long enough, you might even see it.
Mr. Wizard, get me the fuck out of here!
Trinity, we don't have any other choice.
Let go of her.
You sure?
So?
Yeah, well thanks, but I got enough to hold me.  My mother can send me some.  I don't know.
Didn't show up.
You're not supposed to like it. What gets me is your attitude. Listen... tomorrow you show up.
I'll tell you what I don't do... I don't owe anybody 2,000 clams plus interest, stupid.  Show up or I break both your arms, we understand each other?
How?
Good idea.
Sell 'em if you can't smoke them.
I know that Charlie but look at my side.  You undersigned the loans. You vouched for him.  What happens if this kid don't pay me?  I gotta collect from you?  I don't want to do that.  I made a deal with him not you, right?
OK.
How much?
Let's go to the movies...on you.
'But I say to you not to resist the evildoer; on the contrary, if someone takes thy tunic, let him take thy cloak as well...to him who asks of thee, give; and from him who would borrow of thee do not turn away!
'Amen I say to thee, thou wilt not come out from it until thou hast paid the last penny.'
No, I'm serious...You're really good.
Bye.
No you weren't.
Ok.
Hemmingway.  Killed himself.  I was more upset about that than about Groppi, that's for sure.
What did he do?
Who knows?  It's not hard to figure out what she'll wind up like.  When the respect for parents breaks down, that's bad...you know I'm "cumpari" with them...so I take an interest.  You live next door, keep an eye open...but don't get involved.
Oh yeah...didn't read it but I saw the movie...Gregory Peck...pretty good.
Nobody knows anything, believe me.
What is it now?
Not sick...just stupid.  Speaking of stupid, your cousin last night was feeling so good he decided to break into your mother's house...to get some food.
Count it.
Which one, the big tab or the little tab?
Nothing's going on.  Maybe he doesn't want to be alone.  He's go- ing to be sixty-five in a minute --
Unfortunately.  I sat between them at the Bronx Zoo benefit -- it was better than Seconal.
He's cute.
Allison, I trust you.  This is your thing.
I know you do, darling.
I don't like cake.
The fountain is the Caspian Sea and the Sea is serving up caviar.  The 'B's for Beluga, the 'P' for Petrossian.  Of course, they also stand for 'Bill' and for 'Parrish'.
And that?
Include me out.  I've had enough of the conversations.
Yeah.  Goodnight.
Bill's birthday is the day after tomorrow.  There is a provisory by- law in our charter.  Per the discre- tion of the Board, Corporate off- icers can be retired at age sixty- five.
And a glass.
But I know she's grateful for the care you're giving her.
I appreciate your gentlemanliness, Bill, but what we need to do here is drive the dagger home --
What'd it say?
'Yes' to the deal?
Sounds good.
It's going to be great --
That's great!  Wait 'til I show it to Bontecou.
Like 'Smith' or 'Jones --'
I get the feeling you've done some business before.
That's your privilege, Bill.  But given our needs, given the absolute necessity for growth, given the fu- ture, the truth is... joining John Bontecou is every bit as certain as - Death and Taxes.
But the matter's still on the table, Bill --
How nice for you both.
Yes, you made your feeling abun- dantly clear.  Now they want to do the same with theirs.
Don't you want to hear the details?
Mandatory retirement upon our Chairman's sixty-fifth birthday.
Are you?
Yeah.
Quince, you can't unscramble scrambled eggs.
My Doctor Lady?
Don' need you okayin'.
Do I?  I'm a little confused.
'Love'?  Oh, man, I've got troubles of my own.
'The deepest, darkest secrets --'?
Yes?
Excuse me?
Girlfriend?
No.
He must be tired -- this Bontecou thing --
Will it?
It's a saying.
-- That was the place... and you were the guy.
You want me to wait for you, you'll be back --
I wish you had said something to me about staying here --
No.
...I just saw my doctor, he told me everything was fine.
How about giving a guy a break?
I'm sure you'll see to it that it won't be a problem.
You're not thinking of going some- where, are you, Bill?
Glad you like it.  My wife turned me onto cold lamb sandwiches.  Joan -- that was my wife --
And I don't need your goddamn permis- sion either!  You!  Drew!  I don't need anyone to tell me how to run my life.
About Susan?
I wouldn't put it that way.
How about you telling me?  When I ask a simple question, I expect a straight answer.  That's what I'm used to.  Anybody who doesn't give it to me, I fire.
What's okay?
Just a manner of speaking.
I'm sorry to hear that.
May I remind you this is not just a dispute with a putative suitor, this is me.  So watch it...Bill.
Yes?
It's not necessary, Joe.  Drew's going to step aside --
He is --
An offense --
I am not a dream.
The jacket and the pair of pants came with the body I took.  Let me ask your opinion.  Do I blend in?
Of course.
Speak up, please.
'Yes' is the answer to your question.
Please.  Talk to me --
I'm here.
Show me around.  Be my guide.  And in return, you get...
Watch it!
But I've got to tell you, if mergers are in the wild, I've got some great prospects I've developed.  I want to talk to you about them next week.
Next week?
Joe, you don't know how glad I am you're aboard.  Anybody who can take some of the weight off the old man, I'm in his corner.
No thank you, Quince.  I'm sorry, honey.  I'm no good at this.  Why don't you choose whatever cake you like?
Yes, I believe I do.
Hi, honey.
Does Drew tell you everything?
You like him, don't you?
I know it's none of my business --
Forget about me and Mom -- are you going to marry him?
'Be deliriously happy'.  I'm going to do my upmost --
Bravo.
Nothing.
Will it?...
I'm having a helluva time.
Oh, Dad, you're not old.  You'll never be old.
I'm not trying to sharpshoot you, but that 'nothing lasts' stuff, that's what was the trouble with Honey's guy.  He was fooling around and Honey caught him at it.  One girlfriend wasn't enough for him.
So you're a one-girl guy?
Me?  Internal medicine.
-- This is my lucky day.  I arrive in this big bad city and I not only find a doctor, a beautiful woman as well.
You'd give up what you want for the woman you marry?
Why?
Because I like you so much.  You have coffee here every morning, don't you?  If I came by, could you give me the name of a doctor?
I know about your fucking condition, Leonard! I probably know more about it than you do! You don't have a fucking clue about anything else!
I'm Mr. Shelby from 304.

Don't be too hard on yourself.
What the fuck are you doing here?
Yes.
But even if you get your revenge, you won't remember it. You won't even know it's happened.
That's the problem! How can I find John G. when I don't know what's going on?! How did you get me into this?!
I came to you straight after he did it. I showed you what he'd done and asked for your help.
Your wife?
Why would you do that?
* John G. was clever. He took the dead man's gun and replaced it with the sap that he'd hit me with. He left my gun and left the getaway car. He gave the police a complete package. They found a sap with my blood on it in the dead man's hand, and they only found my gun. They didn't need to look for anyone else. I was the only guy who disagreed with the facts, and I had brain damage.						 *

He took away the woman I love and he took away my memory. He destroyed everything; my life and my ability to live.
Just for revenge. That's what keeps me going. It's all I have.
How'd ya get him in here in the first place?
Easy for you to say, you've got the Jag.
Yeah, well maybe she'll make it you. Is that it? You worried she'll use me against you?
How long do you think you can hang around here before people start asking questions?
Like what?
I'm a snitch. He's a cop from out of town looking for information. The local boys put us in touch.
That, and your thing.						   *
Like you've told yourself. Over and over. Conditioning yourself to believe. "learning through repetition" -
I never said he was faking! I never said that!
You exposed him for what he was: a fraud.

I'm not. I was the cop assigned to your			* wife's death. I believed you, I thought			* you deserved the chance for revenge. I helped you find the other guy who was in your bathroom that night.

Safe house is empty...  Air Support's set to jump when we know your drop point.  Gina?
You said Nazi Low-riders...?
I mean <u>full</u> disclosure.
Meth precursors and the Dutch party favors are en route.
I got the item.
What's the recovery?  How much are you looking for?
Off a little alley with cobblestones.  Hemingway went there...
Are you afraid?  Good.  And you don't need a visa. Cause you're with me.
Died in childbirth, having me...
And you're our thirty-percent partner?
I need thirty.  Calculate in, also, the cash you don't have to front...
And the chopsticks and fortune cookies?
Really?
And if I were in the Comoros, in the Indian Ocean, where would you be...?
Would you?  Because if you couldn't, I would be very lonely... I would have left the only world I know and have known since I was seventeen.  But none of this will happen.  So it doesn't matter.  Because we are on the Guajira Peninsula.  And all you see around you...look around... is Archangel de Jesus Montoya- Londono.  He is my man.  And you are a smuggler moving a load...
I know.  And now?
Sit.
He didn't.  Interrogation's not in our skill set.  So c'mon, what suspicions have you master-minded off these associations?
How lucky's Miss Universe gotta be?
White gangs is tweakers and a crystal meth lab in a trailer park. Bounce around the old lady Saturday night and get your recidivist ass busted back...
Good.  So let's go...
On my way back...
I am asking.  You to me.
And Jos, my ace, lots of transshipment.  Lots of action. Skies are crowded.  And the JIT has assets on land, air, and sea.  So any intel you got that can come our way and contribute to the good and welfare...?
If you're down, we're down for the play.
This is Agent James Fujima.
A C.I. we cut loose to your Joint Interagency Task Force.  Name of Alonzo Stevens.  Now, he's YOUR informant.  Stevens, called us.  I haven't spoken to him for six months. I do not know what case you have him on.  I do not know what he is talking about.  But whatever he is doing for you, it sounds like it is going bad.  Right now...
...so there's <u>no</u> industrial- strength HRT weapons team out there tonight?
Hi, Gina.  This is from Frick and Frack. Trudy?
Where's Riccardo?
Goodbye.
Haitian, Dominican, Russian, Israeli?
White supremacist types.
We don't know.  And that's the point.  Maybe there's a mole. Whatever, it's a disaster.  And it's a Joint Interagency Task Force.  I have DEA, ATF, U.S. Customs components in on it.  So the penetration could be from any one agency.  What we do know is I have to suspend operations right now from undercover work through interdictions 'cause I have to assume our Operational Security is blown.
Switek pulling this off...?  That's not faith; that's delusional...
What's it say?
Transshipped to a Malaysian container ship.
Define small.
They will kill you.  And then they will kill your wife, too.
Don't guess. Just come for my day's pay owing and to tell you I'm heading East.
Lotta rich women back there...
What'll we do? Leave now or what? Your place or mine? Oh God, the second I looked at you I knew. Did you?
Sure you're all right?
Top drawer. Maybe if you didn't call me ma'am, things would work out better.
Talking helps. Don't talk, you get muddled in your head. Hey! Now you just look at this here!
Oh, it ain't cheap. I mean, yeah, I'd say this was an all right shirt. Don't like to, uh, you know, have a lot of cheap stuff on my back.
Okay, right, right, okay. Another subject. Where you living? Still at the hotel?
I'm inviting you. I mean if you're not located, I got a place. I'm inviting you, goddamit.
So if you want me to hang around for a few days, I thought you should know.
This is an okay setup you got here, but I'd say you ain't just exactly, uh, flush, is that right or not?
What's all this sweet talk about Florida? Your friend O'Daniel got a stable down there now?
You talk like a man with a tin twat.
The coat? A guy I did a favor once gave it to me. Christ.
Rico. Rico Rizzo.
Keep the goddam blanket on.
You're what?
This is terrible. I meet someone who -- then -- wait, I want to give you a present. For your trip. You'll let me please...
Well, not too, I mean, a little.
Yessir, I can see that.
Well, uh, I'm raring to go.
Ready for anything.
... and taxi fare for me.
Yeah... Only the room service is lousy.  Come on, let me show you the tennis courts.
Hamidou.  Chief of the Guards. Don't fuck with him. He almost killed an Italian dude couple months ago.  Bad news. He try anything with you?
The airport. Trying to get on the plane for the States.
No, don't let her!  I'll... How about Peg? Robbie?
Oh Jesus! 
No!  I'm not going any further! It'll wreck my car.
All over.  Turkish Army up there. It's against the law. They shoot us.  You sure you looking for your friends, man?
Okay!  Ley me out right here.  I'm getting tired of all this bullshit from you.  I'll walk it.
But didn't have heroin.
But just...
What's your father do?
About as good as it looks.
Twelve years.
Two thirty.
Whose?
Oh shit.
It's not important, just technical things. We make our case.  You were very good, you spoke well. The Judge like you. It look good. Don't worry.
Oh Yesil...  Yesil's his name but I...don't know anything... 'bout...Yesil...
Tell them to send flowers to the usual address.
Track bunnies.  Rats.  They're usually around.
I'm sorry.  But I don't think letting you bleed to death is the best apology.
He can imitate anything, you just watch him.
I pull.
No way we can outrun 'em together. Move it!
But it look like a man. It... I saw it.
I didn't protect him, lady. He trusted me. And I didn't protect him... His father...I lost his father to the streets and now, Chuy...
We're down to a "couple" now, huh?
Monks bottle their own wine. Don't they?
Try not to sweat?
What is it?
What?
I could give you a couple of hundred pages of mine, and you could tell me what you think.
How long...?
What are they...?
They're called Novril--they're for your pain. 
The  blizzard was too strong. I couldn't risk trying to get you there. I tried calling, but the phone lines are down.
And you're very brilliant, and you must be a good man, or you could never have created such a wondrous, loving creature as Misery Chastain.  Like a baby.  All done. 
You want to read it?
If you wouldn't mind.
Then the roads are open...
I was supposed to be home for her birthday three days ago.
No. No, it isn't, it's--  --oh pooh, I can't think of any words. Would "great" be insulting?
Yeah, thanks.
Then who did?
I don't suppose I could have a little snack while I wait for the surprise?
I don't know.
You just expect me to whip something off, that it?
You do understand that this isn't the ordinary way books get written-- I mean, some people might actually consider this an oddball situation.
Great.
Annie, what's the matter?
Don't be silly. You'll be brilliant. Think of me as your inspiration.
Paul, it's not worthy of you. Throw it all out except for the part of naming that gravedigger after me. You can leave that in.
I know that, Mister Man--they also call them serials. I'm not stupid, you know.  Anyway, my favorite was Rocket Man, and once it was a no-brakes chapter, the bad guys stuck him in a car on a mountain road and knocked him out and welded the doors shut and tore out the brakes and started him to his death and he woke up and tried to steer and tried to get out, but the car went off a cliff before he could escape and it crashed and burned and--I was so upset and excited and the next week you better believe I was first in line and they always start with the end of the last week and there was Rocket Man trying to get out, and here came the cliff and JUST BEFORE the car went off he jumped free and all the kids cheered--  --but I didn't cheer, I stood right up and started shouting, "This isn't what happened last week--have you all got amnesia?--THEY JUST CHEATED US--THIS WASN'T FAIR--"
They always cheated like that in cliff--  --chapter plays.
Will she still love him with that special perfect love?
Oh.  You can't get this in a restaurant in New York.
Oh, you. I just picked things up over the years.
Paul, my little ceramic penguin in the study always faces due south.
Maybe. Are you ready for the next chapter?
Four or five days ago. Why?
Could be--or a rotten branch or a mountain lion could have landed on it. Could be a lot of things.
What is it?
It's good you found it.
Yes, he is.
I'm sure you know Paul's been going to the Silver Creek Lodge for years to finish his books.
I'll bet that old Mustang's pulling into New York right now.
Yeah. They're in the semis.
Gee, Marcia, if I didn't know you better, I'd think you were suggesting I dredge up the worst horror of my life just so we could make a few bucks.
Sean, please..
I left in a bit of a hurry.  I'm terribly grateful, Sean.
Oh, I am.  Later..
'Thief in the Night?'
I don't know what to do about you, Sean. I'm more than a bit muddled.  I need time.
And you're going to have time.  There's been a change of plans.
A change of plans?
Yes.  We won't be able to have dinner tonight.  Something's come up.  I hope you don't mind.
Billy, make sure Nyah's not followed.
And you're happy about that?
I would've thought the hardest part was exercising restraint.  Curbing that pressing need of your to get your gun off.  You were in such a hurry to knock off that 747, you never figured out where the virus really was.
Not at all.  But how about going into town and confirming your intuitions on site?
Oh well, if that's how you feel about it.
What are you talking about?
Then we got'em!
Right.
Uh-huh?
Well, Senor de l'Arena, there's no reason to disrupt your party any longer.  we have some further concerns about the disposition of your security guards, which you'll receive in our written report by fax in the morning, hard copy to follow.  Shall we?
Ethan Hunt.
Care to wait a decent interval?
I don't know that they 'pinched' it. Don't even know that they're blokes.
There's nearly 2 million in London.
Sean Ambrose, for one.
So would I.  But it's not mine to give.
You can be a thief and have a conscience.
You'll be fine.  I'm going to lose you.
Nyah, it's very important not do anything to alarm Ambrose..
Why did you phrase it like that?
You were there.
'Terrorists?'
- is where Miss Hall comes in.
Miss Hall and Ambrose had a relationship which he took very seriously.  She walked away and he's wanting her back ever since.  We believe she's our surest and quickest way of location him.
We think we've got our finger on the buyer.
Do you?  Even assuming you're able to prevent Ambrose selling Chimera, you've now got an additional problem.  You destroyed all of Chimera at Biocyte.  If Ambrose is going to sell Chimera now, he'll have to do it by taking a pint or so of Miss Hall's blood to market.
You mean that leaves Miss Hall.
Brave girl.  If you can get hold of Bellerophon with the time limit, you may spare her the ultimate sacrifice.  But in either case you've got less than nine hours to kill her or cure her.  After that it's out of our hands and a matter of worldwide material law.  And Hunt.  However you obtain it, we want you to preserve a sample of Chimera.  Bring it back alive.
I'd thank you -- but I'm not sure that was a compliment.
But you were under specific instructions to bring back a living sample of the Chimera virus.  I'd be very interested to know how, after you'd managed its recovery intact, it subsequently got destroyed.
I do.
I don't.  No exactly.
Sorry it couldn't be under happier circumstances.
Yes, he knew.  Just..
You keep calling me Dmitri.  You really shouldn't.
Yep.
Roger that.
Left jacket pocket confirmed.
She must still be on the property.
No garage entrance.  Lobby's protected by five guards on rotating patrol.
I'm not waiting 48 hours.  When we're done at Biocyte, if she's not out of Ambrose's, I'm going in and getting her out.
I don't remember what happened!  We were at the bar, drinking, laughing -- having fun.
Look we can use someone from the Embassy and we can get the local authorities involved. Close off his transportation.
What can we do, Barnes?  Put a guy at the airport?  How many identities do you think Hunt has?  How many times has he slipped past custom, in how many countries?  These guys are trained to be ghosts.  <u>We</u> taught them how to do it, for Christ's sake!
Fold it.  Fold it tight.
Always.
Krieger.
We got it.  On your feet.
No, I got out of the car and I ran to the bridge.
Who is they, who is they?
Ethan, you're not making sense. Let me go in and talk to Kittridge. I'm going to tell him you had nothing to do...
Sure...
I didn't say that.
I'm going to try and get some sleep.
This stuff is so sticky.
Dont <u>think</u>, be <u>sure</u>.  Are you clean?
No sir.
Yeah.
Of IMF agents.  At the Embassy.  Tonight.
But the list Golitsyn stole was a decoy.
Yes, the mole's deep inside. And -- like you said.  You survived.
What kind?
Exactly, that's your job.  Tomorrow on the train, you can't let this list get out into the open.  What's the range of this thing?
About what?
Why don't you come back with me?
Oh man...I don't know.  I'm gonna miss being disreputable.
The penny drops.  <u>You</u> are <u>not</u> Job.  Yes, Job is not given to quoting Scripture in his communications. And there was its tone -- aggressive but playful.  Job is not playful.  So you're something of a paradox.
It's easy to say the disk is worthless when you say I can't look at the information and <u>see</u> if it's worthless. Not a tenable position, sir.
What was your deal with Job?
Done.  Bring it to me in London.  I want it by the end of the week.
It doesnt, dear girl.  as long as you tell me where the money is.
What about Job?
Time up.
We're not outta here yet.
My contact is extremely shy.
Higher.
If Max doesn't like what you have to say, you'll be wearing that shroud indefinitely.
I'm willing to take the chance.
I don't know, I had to go to Chicago again.  You were in Kiev.  You tell me.
Tell you what?
He won't be back in a hurry?
Theyre covering this frequency, Ethan. Cut all radio communications.  Repeat. Cut all radio communications.
- so I watched Europe. Once you showed up in England..it was easy.
I can sit up straight.  I just can't..sit up straight very well.  It's not important!  I saw who shot me.  Ethan, I saw the mole.  It was Kittridge.  <i>Kittridge!</i>
A meeting tomorrow on the TGV, enroute to Paris.
I usually am.
Once we leave the safehouse, get in there and crash.  Ill call you from Paris.
You got it.
Good luck.
Why don't you take a look?
And a lonely ass.
Its not working.
Phew!  Weve got five minutes...
No, I'm going.
You're not gonna marry him, Cosmo. Do you love him, Loretta?
You're welcome.
His brother.
And go to confession.
Yeah.
The guy died.
What killed him?
He got hit by a bus.
You've got to come. You've got to give me away.
And maybe that's why I had the Bad Luck. Maybe if you gave me away, and I got married in a church, in a wedding dress, instead of at the City Hall with strangers standing outside the door, maybe then I wouldn't had the Bad Luck I had.
I didn't have no wedding cake, no reception or nothing. Johnny got down on his knees and proposed to me at The Grand Ticino.
Who is this man? You're engaged!
Why?
But that wasn't Johnny's fault.
I'm making you a steak.
Instantaneous.
Get all of me. Take everything.
It makes you look like an angel.
This time I was trying to do everything right.
She didn't like me.
Kinda gaudy.
How can you ask me that?
The deal was if I came to the Opera with you you'd leave me alone forever.
I don't know. Everything seems like nothing now against that I want you in my bed. I don't care if I burn in hell. I don't care if you burn in hell. The Past and Future is a joke to me now. I see that they're nothing, I see they ain't here. The only thing that's here is you. And me. I want you to come upstairs. Now. I tried to take everything last night, like you told me, but I couldn't. I couldn't take everything in a hundred years. It's the way we are. We compound each other.
Let me go home.
I'm freezing to death.
No, I'll tell him.  What am I going to tell him?
Must it be so definite? Can't we just say that we will be married when I get back?
Where? At the City Hall? No! I want the whole wedding or we will have Bad Luck. For a whole wedding to be planned, a date must be set.
He's my younger brother.
Not yet. That old lady makes him sweat.  Where's that card?
I don't wanna talk about it.
Where's pop?
Hey there  ...YOU WITH THE STARS IN YOUR EYES...
You gotta date?
Alright. This is your penance. Say two rosaries and... be careful, Loretta. Reflect on your life.
Alright.
He owes her a wedding from the first time when there was none.
But why would a man need more than one woman?
Of course I want to.
Absolutely!
I'll remember that. What do you do?
I'm not eating alone. Can I ask you a question?
No.
I'm too old for you.
What? What?
Did you dress her up like this?
And what do you burn, apart from witches?
Wait.  Wait ... tell me, what also floats on water?
It is I, Arthur, son of Uther Pendragon, from the castle of Camelot.  King of all Britons, defeator of the Saxons, sovereign of all England!
Where did you get the coconuts?
Am I right?
You don't vote for kings.
Well, how did you become king, then?
The Lady of the Lake, her arm clad in the purest shimmering samite, held Excalibur aloft from the bosom of the water to signify by Divine Providence ...  that I, Arthur, was to carry Excalibur ... That is why I am your king! | |                              OLD WOMAN |      Is Frank in?  He'd be able to deal with this one. | DENNIS Look,  strange women lying on their backs in ponds handing out swords ... that's no basis for a system of government.  Supreme executive power derives from a mandate from the masses, not from some farcical aquatic ceremony.
And not too expensive.
We are now no longer the Knights Who Say Ni!
I move for no man.
A scratch?  Your arm's off.
No, it isn't.
Look!
This is the castle of of my master, Guy de Loimbard.
Well ... can we come up and have a look?
Bedevere, my Liege.
This new learning amazes me, Sir Bedevere.  Explain again how sheep's bladders may be employed to prevent earthquakes.
Who ... Who breaks out?
Ni, ni, ni!
What does it say?
I am an enchanter.
I do.  You seek the Holy Grail.
A Grail?
It is the rabbit.
What?
I warned you!
What?
What I object to is that you automatically treat me like an inferior ...
Oh, very nice. King, eh!  I expect you've got a palace and fine clothes and courtiers and plenty of food.  And how d'you get that? By exploiting the workers! By hanging on to outdated imperialist dogma which perpetuates the social and economic differences in our society!  If there's EVER going to be any progress ...
Be quiet!
Good idea, O Lord!
... Well, we did do the nose.
What is your quest?
Why?
Really, I feel fine, sir.
I can understand that.
Didn't mean to?  You put your sword right through his head!
You even kicked the bride in the chest!  It's going to cost me a fortune!
Oh ... that's awfully nice.
But I don't want any of that, I'd rather ...
Shut your noise, you,  and get that suit on!
If we ... er ... 
Oh, yes!  we'll keep him in here, obviously.  But if he had to leave and we were with him.
No, not anyone else - just me.
Make sure he doesn't leave.
The Prince ... ?
Yes ...  make sure ...
I'm afraid our life must seem very dull and quiet compared to yours.  We are but eightscore young blondes, all between sixteen and nineteen-and-a-half, cut off in this castle, with no one to protect us.  Oooh.  It is a lonely life ... bathing ... dressing ... undressing ... making exciting underwear....
No.  It's unhealthy.
You got my note!
Bravely ran away, away.
Sixty.
That's pretty good for a ghillie.
If you were looking for promotion, you should have picked one of the healthier ones.
What?
The good-looking one.
John, it's not your problem what she eats.
But I'm the only one she trusts.
I'm on ninety pounds a year plus seventy pounds for a pile of tartan I'd be wearing anyway.  That's as much as a Page of the Back Stairs gets and that job's only for toffs.  I'm Her Majesty's Highland Servant! Indoors and Out.  There's no stopping me now.
She'll think it's her fault for keeping me.
It's a diary.
I can't move to tidy.
She needs me, Archie.  She canna do without me, she said it to my face.  How can I stop now?
Yeah.
Have you met Mr Lyle?  He's in sugar...?
I fear the influence he has on her. The man's word is not to be credited. He is an arriviste of the very lowest water.  She's having a bust cast of him.  In Nero Marquino marble.
Are you deaf as well as stupid?
Well, I'm sorry, but I really do think it's too much that the gentlemen of the house should be dictated to by a servant.
Not now he doesn't.  This is my place.
My own.
How will I know?
I need a man who knows where I am.
In matters concerning the Household, I act on her behalf.
I've been called back to London.  My last day.  I thought I might take a walk on Lochnagar.
Still, someone must attend you.  Your wife should not have let you out.
The truth is, the Queen would be safer doing her duty and returning south to her public.  John Bull loves her and John Bull is her best defense.
But others will know that you acted for the greater good.
I've no family, ma'am, apart from my brothers and sisters.
Yes, ma'am.
Yes, ma'am.
Sir Henry is not alone.  They all wish it.  The same people who refused to grant my husband the title of King because he was deemed of insufficient rank--
Who by?
That doesn't make him an expert.
Having considered my position here at court, I have come to the conclusion that it is in the best interest of Your Majesty that I should resign.
Why?
I believe he is unwell, ma'am.
Ma'am.
Yes, ma'am.
Prince Albert is at Windsor, ma'am.
And maybe you've been taking too many drugs.
Security camera.  Pulled your files before I came down. Be careful what you say, kids ... I know where you live.
What the hell are you talking about?
It's twelve-thirty!
Greg never came home.  A few hours is one thing, Nick, but this is different. Something's happened to him.
Turn if off!
No.  Look, I know you're not going to believe me, but listen anyway...  I think the game's alive somehow.
It's not just the cable system.  It's in the phone system as well, the electronic net.  It's everywhere.
Like the fractals?
Right.  And then communication satellites, and then anywhere.
They made ARCADE.  It's still a game, right?  It thinks like a game.  Maybe it still has to play by the rules. Someone had to program it in the first place, didn't they?.
You realize that in order to do that, we'd actually have to play the game.
I was afraid you'd say that.
Drives 'em crazy every time.
I don't want anything to happen to you.  I care about you.
One.  In case...
Check your read-out.
So tell me you're okay, then.
Sure.  Never come back.  Disappear forever.
You have no time.
So what's so different about Arcade? You guys've been talking about it for months.
Give her a chance, will you?
I am giving her a chance.  Why don't you get off my back?
You've got to talk to Ray you've got to fix this.
Home! Meet me at the office. We've got to do something ... you've got to do something Adam!
What do you mean "you know"?
You're broke!
Sure want to thank ya for drivin' all the way up to see me from that Beverly Hills Hotel.
Okay.
I don't know. All we do is take an impression of the credit card and until you check out it just sits in our files.
That's fine, Mr. Kesher. You can pay cash when you check out. I'm sorry. it was my duty to inform you.
Have a good evening, Mr. Kesher.
Well, I ...
Wow!
Well then, take a seat everyone. Betty why don't you join Jimmy and we'll play the scene. Is there anything you'd like to say Bob... something to Betty before they begin?
She sure is. She's letting me stay here while she's working on a movie that's being made in Canada, but I guess you know that.  I couldn't afford a place like this in a million years. Unless of course I'm discovered and become a movie star. Of course, I'd rather be known as a great actress than a movie star, but sometimes people end up being both and that is, I guess you'd say, sort of why I came here. I'm sorry, I'm just so excited to be here..I mean I just came here from Iowa and now I'm in this dream place. You can imagine how I feel.
I'm...I'm... oh no... I thought when I woke up... I thought sleep would do it ...
How do you remember how to talk?
That's where I was going... Mulholland Drive.
"But you won't..."
"Then they'd put you in jail."
You've got to eat something. You're just nervous about going over to see if you're Diane Selwyn.
Everything is A-okay, but I've gotta get that sandwich!
Do you know them?!
Hey, let's introduce the brand new you to Hollywood. We haven't seen the roof garden yet.
I had a dream about this place.
Yeah.
The boys found this on the floor in back of the Caddy.
Great.. great. Is there any kind of hint or anything ?
Jesus, my legs are asleep. I'll never be able to win this shit.
Yeah, I'd say that's it.
Good. Nice to see you, Bruce. Johnny.
Give me a fucking.....
I'm working on it.
Then you didn't give him any passwords of any kind ?
NO ! I wouldn't do that.
You didn't think about it did you ? I read your file. It said you had a nervous breakdown.
Know what ? That it was your fault ?
It wasn't my fault. I was just part of a team. I was doing my job...
Yes.
Girder, watch your head.
Either you'll be shot with bullets, impaled with a large spike, or nailed like a super model. Basically you're fucked any way you go.
I did, but this room has four exits and only one opens, it's up to them in the control room. There's one right over there. The exit light is on, but he can change it.
Let's just see if he can make it into round two....
What ?
What ? Are you my mother ?
No.
Yeah, maybe.... Let's start the background checks. Let's see where they live and what kind of security systems....
Checking........
I make roughly four hundred thousand a year.
I have entrusted you with a great many things. In your tenure with this company you have seen and heard things that could upset the very economic world in which we live. I think this kind of loyalty should be rewarded.
I had suggested that they tone down the program so that the "guests" might take longer to expire.
Yes sir. It turns out we put an innocent man into the "park" and he was not the one who stole from the stamp machine. That is also about the time when Bruce began refusing.
I'll bet that would be the Park run of the century !
Do you think the assistant, what's his name...
I thought, and correct me if I'm wrong, but weren't you trying to play both sides ?
No. I am not a homosexual.
He must have had a gun stashed. God damn it !
I'll see that bet.
The power went out in half the park.
How can this happen ?
Dinner at my place then ? Say, seven o'clock ?
Thank you, won't you come in ?
Thanks.
Would that impress you ? I mean you're the kinda woman that probably has Ferrari written all over your personal ad.
My own sit down Star Wars arcade game. Wanna play it ?
Fine, fine, I feel like a chicken McNugget.
Zach from work ?
No.
You're Vada right?
This is California, anything is possible.
Don't mention it.
I would do it again in a minute.
What about living in the real world pal?
You're still asking me to break the law.
Great.
Of course.
Hi honey.
Ask him if he needs a good tuba player.
Ah, well, I bought her this huge pumpkin for Halloween, but she couldn't bear to carve it so she saved it for weeks, and it ended up under the Christmas tree.
I was pushing as fast as I could.
They sure did! They got kicked out of school, they married truck drivers...these are my mother's greatest accomplishments? I'm sure glad I came all the way out here to find them out.
You mean, you knew about me?
I'd like to, thanks.
We performed on the beach one summer...ha...everything went wrong.
Honey I'd be proud to be your father, really. It just isn't so.
She didn't wanna miss out on anything...especially motherhood...it got to be a real problem with us.
Well actually I was born in Siberia and then they shot her and sent me home to my Dad.
What can I do for you?
I guess you have.
Rose.
O.K. Thank you very much.
Your mother?
I'm sure she did. 
But we made a business deal.
I want juice!
Make that sixty and I'm docking your allowance for two weeks.
I don't need you to be telling me to...
I wasn't eavesdropping, I was overhearing.
Vada.
A big difference, if someone found it we should keep looking, if they didn't we're just wasting our time.
Let me see if it changes colors on me.
I'm not gonna break it, I just wanna see it change colors.
I already did, it's a totally barbaric custom...but on you, it looks good.
No...it was me. And I'm sorry mom, really, ju...just tell me what to do, I'll do anything.
Yeah?

Well I know you're not crazy about taking Vada around tomorrow, so...I just want you to know I appreciate it though.
Phil, I think you should consider... fades as Vada walks off
But...are you engaged or something?
Dating, seriously dating. You're thirsty, want something to drink? Sure you do, it's been a long trip.
Committed?
I'll do better than that. I'll send you off with your own private guide.
Okay...take your time...I'll...I'll go for a walk around.
Yeah, well he left out a couple of steps, ah look, I've gotta get back to these bills, Phil will you help Vada get settled?
Oh I see, 'cause usually that doesn't require such a lengthy consultation.
I'll be here.
Well I'm sort of involved.
Where I come from, involvement...generally calls for a substantial piece of jewelry.
Oh, well, I don't wear a lot of jewelry.
Oh, sure okay.
I'll see you then...I look forward to it.
When did you umm, I mean umm...
No, I gotta go to the cemetery, keep your head up. Don't look at the ball, look at me.
WHAT?
Okay, I know you've suffered a terrible loss, and there's really nothing anyone can do to comfort you, but I urge you to focus on the times you had with the camper, the trips you took, the sights you saw, those days are gone now, but they'll live on in your heart forever.
It's her home! It's where she lives!!
Sweetheart, did they bring Mr. Layton to your house today?
No.
I'm a licensed cosmetologist, I worked for two years, at the &quot;Dino Raphael&quot; Salon, all my customers cried when I told them I was leaving.
They're dead?
Yes they are.
I need the job.
Oh, You still want it? Even though uhh...
Great, you can start right away. Call me Harry. Now, umm, is this what you'd normally wear for work? Don't get me wrong, I like it, very much, but the....
Oh right, right, . Bader Lorenzo Died June 22 1972 Devoted husband to Nicolette. Cherished father of Babritzio and Heidi, In lieu of flowers, please send donations to the holy names society.
Kinda like men.
I brought the baby into the room a couple of times, she opened her eyes, yeah, yeah I think she saw Vada. It was.....
Yeah, and when those suppers are disrupted because there's a car crash, or there's a fire, or a little boy steps on a beehive.
Dad, why are you dressed up to go to bingo?
Why?
Sorry.
Ahh, Vada, just put anything you want in the cart, anything at all.  I don't know what's gotten into her today.
Why not?
He's okay isn't he?
She was pretty, and kind, she had your eyes. Oh boy did she love to laugh. Sometimes when you laugh, you sound just like her.
Do you miss her?
Oh, I'm running late. Shelly'll be here any minute.
No, no no....
Yes she is, but she's very upset, so she's not seeing anyone.
Really? Already? The summer's just begun.
It's summer! You're kids! Go play!
Vada, this is an adult writing class.
I wrote a poem too.
I love you like my Dad loves Shelly. I wanna live here.
No.
Does he love her?
Now when I see him with Shelly, sometimes he seems like the old Harry.
I am.
I'm not upset. I will never play with those girls. I only surround myself with people who I find intellectually stimulating.
Come on sweetie.
I would.
They'll come around. Close your eyes, I wanna bring out the gorgeous color in them. The first rule in applying eye makeup, is you can never wear enough blue eye shadow.
Uh huh, i've been trying to get out to Hollywood for years to do makeup for all the stars, I haven't gotten there yet.  All right, open your eyes.
Why? It's not dinner time yet.
She only wants to do it because her sweetie pie's the teacher.
Oh no!  UUH.
Hey, we can become blood brothers.
Do you remember her?
Heaven.
I am not.
I am running faster!!
Bye Ma.
I have to anyway, my mom will be worried.
But, I don't know how.
Okay.
I should look different.
I've adjusted, and thanks for asking.
Is Newsday a real interview, or just some cute guy you're setting me up w...
... weeks.
No, he's nothing like me.  He's like you.  Only straight.
I'll have to kill myself before I call him.
You're butting in.
Someday she'll thank you.
Major.  Dish.
Tell him you're afraid of love. Afraid of needing.
You need a few dollars.
See.  Dry.  It's in the delivery.
The twin part.  I like to remain impartial in my contempt.
He said that, too.
After two weeks of cataloguing all his faults, I made a command decision that changed my life.
... except one.
No.
Oh, that.  I forgot I even said th...
Probably am.  Forget I brought it up.
... whatever is manly and independent.
... that this is all my fault?
WHY DON'T YOU JUST DRIVE A STAKE THROUGH MY HEART?
Actually, it all starts tomorrow. It's one of those four-day weddings, with all the traditional events, and ten million people flying in from Madagascar such.
I need you.
She's too genuine.
How can you trust someone you can never mistrust?
Hey, cabs are expensive.  I'm cheap, remember?
You keep saying that.
Except for that.
The night we met.
ISN'T THERE A GUARD?  A JANITOR? A FUCKING CLEANING WOMAN? I'LL TAKE A BURGLAR!  SOMEBODY'S GOTTA BE IN TH...
A bad combination.
Maybe tomorrow, you'll feel dif...
She hasn't told anybody, what am I supposed to do?
Love doesn't have to be right. It just has to be love.
I was so confused, so conflicted, so... unstable.
... yeah, that.
This is the dumbest thing I will ever do.  So dumb, in fact, that I can't.  I don't think.
... wrote it, yeah.  I'm the bad guy.
Almost three.
That's little egotistical.
With those big, dark, haunted eyes. As if you were harborin' some... unspeakably... guilty... secret.
Is there food?
Then why are you listening to her -
Barnett, John Triplette. How's she doing?
Everybody likes to be as good as their word.
Whose word?
Nothing; Barnett. It's my job.
He's lining up talent for Hal Phillip Walker.
Oh, no, listen, I don't want to take up too much of your time.
D.C.?  Tammany Hall?  He came there?
Stop it!
When is it?
National?
Glad to see you. Ester'll be glad, too.
It's hard to say. Doctors thought she'd come home a week ago. All it was was appendix.
I said, maybe I'll change my name again.
I see... Well, those doctors are real miracle workers.
That Tom sure is cute.
You must really like him.
No.
Oh, well, thanks. Ah, oh, maybe you know where...
I feel really good.
I don't know his first name.
I've been a Little dyspeptic.
Remember, about a month ago, your church choir cut a record?
Or course. You should come over to the house. The boys would love to meet you.
Who is this, right?  I called you last night.
Oh.
Oh.
I'm sorry but I have to go.
Well, there's a couple of girls in Printers Alley if you got any questions. I know I've seen that G- string stuff for sale someplace around.
Hello.
He's pretty well known down here.
Out.
How long have you been together?
Hello.
Hal? Well, Hal and I have been friends for a long time.
No, we never did that
He is to a lot of people.
Well, you just remember, if you can't kick front, kick back, 'cause at least you're kicking... Ten minutes, okay?
Wade -- I've been working toward this audition for years.
I see.
Well, back in slave times they had a thing called the underground railroad. And we got a whole fan club out there just waiting to be conductors.  So, you kids out there, keep the faith. Cause Mickey and Mallory will be comin' to your town real soon.
Now that you bring it up, yes. They were different men. I hadn't really thought that much about it. Since many psychiatric opinions are, by a rule, sought out for this kind of situation. What do you think normally happens? The Knoxs are assigned a family psychologist that takes care of them throughout the rest of their lives? The state doesn't work like that.
Susanville, Soledade.
By all means.
You're a celebrated cop. Twenty-six years on the force, a best-seller out on paperback...
Mickey's better half herself. Mallory Knox. This little lady drowned her father in a fish tank.
What?
You're taking us to that holding cell now.  All right, Cut!
Yes, sir.
Yeah, it's pretty hard to beat the king.
Not to anybody. She sings.
Songs. 'He's A Rebel', 'Leader Of The Pack', 'Town Without Pity', that Dusty Springfield song 'I Only Want To Be With You'. That's what I hear anyway. Her behaviour was the main thing the doctors' report used against you. So even if she would see me, which she won't, I couldn't put her on camera anyway. If I ask her, 'Mallory, are you insane?' And she starts singing 'Dead Skunk In The Middle Of The Road', that blows our whole case.
Let's discuss it when I'm unbound.
Then was it worth it?
Was an instant of purity worth a lifetime lie? Yeah, it was.
Tell me about the purity.
I'm sure we will.
Let me check on Scott. He's hurt bad.
Probably not, but we're gonna give it the old college try.
'Every week by forty million people. I am a respected journalist.' Have you won any awards?
Without any further ado, Mickey and Mallory...
I said I'd give you a interview. Now unless I'm mistaken, we just did a interview.  We did an interview, didn't we?
And they made the first move?
Have you seen 'Pumping Iron?'
Only on a much grander scale.
They've hypnotized the nation.
That's the way of the world.
Next week's episode.
I hear ya. Play.
Huh uh. This dozen is for Mickey.
Roger, I'm starting to get pissed. Just drop this fuckin' donut shit, and gather your gear.
They're real Goddamn good. They'll be there for when ya need 'em. Where are they?
I'm taking one of these men. Yates, come with me.
Fucking dammit! Mickey hold onto that thought. Reload, quick!
Scott, genius cameraman, Roger, magician with sound. Unruly Julie, I could sooner do without my arm than Unruly Julie.
Don't recite the fact to me. I'm sure I know 'em better than you do.
Two guys?
Don't call my men assholes.
They pay you three bucks a day an' all the cotton you can eat.
Come on, honey.
Goddamnit, nigger - you must think you're white! Who d'you think you are - king of Harlem?
Okay.
Used to be. On the railroad.
Anderson.
Well, she never gave me none. Look, you better find him a place pretty quick.
I don't know.
Okay, I will.
You don't think much of yourself, do you?
Go on - you can have one!
Hell, baby, I bet you think we got tails.
That's why you come back, huh?
No. Women're always followin' me 'round.
Well, what d'you think?
It's okay with me, baby. But how' you goin' to like it?
Am I as good as they?
Hmmm - good coffee.
I keep thinking about him.
Don't ask, baby - huh!  How much money you got with you?
What the hell could you do?
What're you going to do?
I can't stand to see you like that. I know you can't help it.
Just of getting hurt. They can't touch me inside.
Well, that don't do me one bit of good!
Like a home, for one thing.
What 'you signifyin'?
I guess you'll be making' some changes 'round here.
I'm Duff.
Wouldn't have known you.
Okay.
I guess I'll make me some trouble in that town.
How come you all ain't sendin' them to the same school?
I guess I ain't.
Aw, I do. But 'seems to me us colored folks do a whole lot of church-goin'. It's the whites that need it real bad.
Well, that figures.  Kind of fits in with everything else, don't it!
Don't look like there's a right way.
Well, at least she ain't married to no white man's nigger! You been stoopin' so long, Reverend, you don't even know how to stand straight no more. You' just half a man!
How you doin'?  Hi there!
I understand.
Nothin'.  She's all right. Wouldn't have made it without her. Christ - haven't worked in eight months. Right now, I'm waitin' for some insurance money. And man, when I get it, I got plans to make me some more.  Let's get out'a here. This place gives me the willies.  You got some money?
Shut up, Will.
Sometimes.  And sometimes I don't--  Shut the fuck up!
Sometimes, I want to blow his fucking brains out!
My man's coming to get my ass out of here. That's good enough for me.
Play it straight with me and you've got nothing to worry about. When it's over, I inject you with the antitoxin.
An Artificial Intelligence. A computer system that's developed the capacity for sentient thought. They're dangerous and totally unpredictable.
How's the villa's security?
What would you say if I told you we could correct your neural damage?
It hasn't yet.
That's gonna be tough because Dixie McCoy's dead. The A.I. flatlined him.
Then we rendezvous with the final member of our team. For now, that's all you need to know.
Sorry, bullshit. We haven't even begun and you're already jeopardising this operation.
Stick with her. I want the process to become second nature to you. We fly for Freeside at dawn.
He's a Sense/Net Chairman. Why would he launch an A.I.?
I prefer distrusting you. It'll keep us honest.
My problem, Mr. Case, is simply that I am a soulless bastard.
Always...By the way, you know that girlfriend you don't have?
It's Case. Remember me?
Jesus Christ, Kid. Nobody's ever cracked Sukura.
All things possible in Babylon.
Jah guides us.
Maybe so...
Right...
You're Dixie McCoy's construct. That makes you something special.
A guy who calls himself Armitage.
When we're done, erase this friggin' tape.
You cruise A.I.'s, you end up on tape.
Well, it ain't exactly a bed of roses down here. We gonna run or not?
How long, Dixie?
Then I'll fry taking this son of a bitch out. I'm making the run, Dixie.
Case. Make yourselves comfortable.  Anyone like a taste?
I thought you already left.
I had to limit your options.
Couple of months.
Then you don't really know who he is, do you?
Hey... you're not supposed to be up.
Almost two days.
We'll find out soon enough. If you don't pull the splices out.
You're not ready yet. They said two days.
What is it with you? Why is it so important? It's a buzz, right? Like getting high.
Sure. I finally pulled a run on my old man's credit file when I was seventeen... only it was too late for him.
Won't that mean you're dead?
Technically, yeah, but people have made it back after as long as three minutes.
Dixie McCoy didn't.
I don't sleep much. You packed?
You scared the shit out of me, man. You were dead for fifteen seconds. Totally flatlined.
We've still got to find the mainframe.
Like what?
When it's not yours. My mom was going through her Harlequin Romance phase.
Yeah, I know.
 uhh, must have forgotten-
Yeah, but sometimes kissing the losers can be a fun diversion.
At the end of the yeat the person who got the most direct his to my head got to toss me into the pool.
That is lingerie.
Transitioned?
Why?
Betty.
A flack jacket.
Have you been there?
They hid my car--
I bet Good Housekeeping would go gaga over the cole slaw piece.
Not yet. Every person in this office comes in here and watches you guys! It's like the goddamn Young and the Restless! Rigfort's salivating over it.
I already checked. There are some pretty serious couples in there.
Yes. I'll go. Yes.
You know what?  Why don't you just pick me up here? We could all share a limo.
Oh yeah. The best. Josie takes in the spectacle around her.
Josie, you rock my world. You're like the most amazing girl I've ever dated. You're so smart and fun and crazy! You rock my world.
See!
I can't do this.
Is that true?
That's the spirit!
This is it Jos! This is my ninth inning! The game isn't over--I just thought it was!  I get on the Southglen baseball team, the right scout sees me-- I'm into the minors- it's game time!
With the reading comprehension of a fifteen year old! Plus, I'm popular... You want to be popular... I can recognize a cry for help when I see one.
She's sixteen years old, Rob. That's totally and completely illegal.
Thanks. And what are -
I'm Josie. Geller. I think the school would probably be pretty comfortable with you calling, me that. Josie.
But Humpty Dumpty was alone.
Do you think you'll find her?
Wow. You believe in me that much--
Well, are you here with anybody?
Yeah, I have.
Nah uh.
It's really hard to do. Some kids try for all of-high school and never make it.
Maybe we should sit.
Rob, I mean it. I want you to be my first. Me and you. Once the floor stops spinning, let's have sex.
We went through the door...
No!
I know.
Of course you do, and I want you to... but there's no need to hurry it along, is there?
But I guess my best just isn't good enough.
Just what?
<i>                      -- A bow? --        But why? --                  How ugly! -- What's in it? --                What's in it?</i>
<i>                      Listen now, you don't understand. That's not the point of Christmasland.</i>
I told you I want that room unpacked.
Oh, come on Dad...
Are you nuts or something?  What the hell is that going to do?
He can't hold you Jesse.  He's losing his grip - you can get out.
He'll die with me!
Could be all night.  Guy gets his rocks off like this. Hangs out in queer S & M joints downtown.  Likes prettyboys like you.
It was okay.
Schneider's always got a stick up his ass.
He must've been working late and some fruitcake came in and sliced him up like a kielbasa.  In the shower!  Left bloody footprints all over the...
How come?
That's okay, I wanted to.
Let me look at your eye...
Remember in the diary - Nancy said that she kept finding herself in a boiler room?  Fred Krueger worked here.  It's an old power- plant - a steam generator!
Well, what am I supposed to do?
Shhh.  Just concentrate.
Maybe it only happens when you're sleeping - that's the way it was with Nancy, wasn't it?
Now, there's an idea we can take off on.  Maybe we should drive out to the beach tonight and lay out a couple of blankets and...  Until I fall asleep.
What is it?
I don't know - a sharp pain.
Will you leave me alone?  Please.
What are you gonna do?  How are you gonna help?  I'm losing my mind.  I don't want to have you watch me fall apart.
No, Jesse.  This isn't happening. It's gotta be everything you've taken in -- Schneider and the diary and the glove -- only it's all mixed up.
You okay?
How'd you sleep, honey, okay?
Fine.
Just some answers.  There are other kids involved, its not just Kristen.  All good kids, smark kids.
I'm sorry to hear that, but you're the experts on this, not me.  If I had any insights, believe me, I'd share them with you.
I'll need to take her things.
Don't "hi Mom" me.  What are you still doing up?  It's past one!
Kristen, don't start with me.  You know what your shrink said...
He's close...
Yes.  I'm going to see her tonight.
I think so.
I don't do that shit.
Those are ancient history.
Say listen, Doc.  I got a new theory about all these suicides.
My mother's dead.  Died in her sleep.
The nightmares are nothing but a symptom of their real problems.
With Hypnocyl?
That's right.
So do I.
Do you think we can get the Hypnocyl in by tomorrow?
Then maybe you're ready.
Your dreams?
And what are they?
That's precisely what they need.  Some uninterrupted REM sleep to release all this negative energy.
What?
There are times when it doesn't offer much comfort.  I've seen you before.  Sister...?
If he continues having these outbursts, I'll have to have him isolated permanently.
I'll go straight to Carver if I have to.  He'll either back me up or accept my resignation.
Of course.
Now you're lying.
Well, they can be.
Films mainly.
Oh splendid.  Well done.  How's the pay in movies?  I mean, last film you did, what did you get paid?
Fine.
Yes.  Well.  My pleasure.
Right.  Great.  Classic.  Classic.
I brought these, but clearly...
Okay.
Well, I've been on a diet since I was nineteen, which means basically I've been hungry for a decade.  I've had a sequence of not nice boyfriends -- one of whom hit me: and every time my heart gets broken it gets splashed across the newspapers as entertainment. Meantime, it cost millions to get me looking like this...
She left me.
No, that's fine.  I love that you tried... time was I'd have done the same.
I'm rash and I'm stupid and what am I doing with you?
I don't know, I'm afraid.
Well, there's a question -- without an interesting answer.
'No, turn over 4 TRS's and tell them we need radar feedback before the KFT's return at 19 hundred -- then inform the Pentagon that we'll be needing black star cover from ten hundred through 12.15' -- and don't you dare say one word about how many mistakes I made in that speech or I'll pelt you with olives.
Gripping.  It's not Jane Austen, it's not Henry James, but it's gripping.
With a goat playing a violin.
Yes -- happiness wouldn't be happiness without a violin-playing goat.
I could have a stunt bottom, yes.
Definitely.  Ths is important stuff.
Both.
Oh God yes -- I'm sorry.
What is it about men and nudity? Particularly breasts -- how can you be so interested in them?
Damn, I forgot the jam.
You do?
I don't want a goddamn cup of tea.  I want to go home.
Well, you know -- it's just one day. Today's papers will all have been thrown away tomorrow.
Okay.
The truth is...
I'm sorry.  Is this a problem?
Well, don't over-do it.  I don't want people saying, 'There goes that famous actor with the big, fat girlfriend."
Tempting but... no, thank you.
I can't say I know Patrick all that well.
Anna Scott?
Yes.
Of course.  And is he your favourite Italian film director?
Yes.  What do you think?
Well, yes -- usually -- I'd just changed to go home -- but I thought I'd just deal with this final call.
I'll see what I can do.
Still, not sparkling.
Unless it's illegal in the UK to serve liquids below room temperature: I don't want you going to jail just to satisfy my whims...
This is Henry James film?
Thanks.  I don't think you'll believe who was just in here.
I suppose so.
Can I help you?
Okay.  Tell me, would I have to pay a wet rag as much as I pay you?
Hello, Anna ahm...  Scott -- have some wine.
I think you do, yes.
Really?
She's perfect, perfect.
No really, one of them marries me and then leaves me quicker than you can say Indiana Jones -- and the other, who seriously ought to have known better, casually marries my best friend.
How about Miss Flintstone?
It's not yogurt -- it's mayonnaise.
Two?  That's it?
Absolutely no idea.  Remembering one name's bad enough...
What?
I think she said her name was 'Flintstone.'
Sort of.
And she's in your house.
Right.  Right.  You think it's the wrong moment.  Fair enough.  Do you mind if I have a go?
Why not?
I suppose I might have told one or two people down the pub.
What?
So?
What book?
Well, ideally, when I went back to the desk, you'd remove the Cadogan guide to Bali from your trousers, and either wipe it and put it back, or buy it.  See you in a sec.
He also thinks he may have given her reason to seek sexual attention elsewhere, but he didn't say how. He has been heard to say to his wife, 'I hate you, I don't ever want to see you again. You've betrayed me.'  So. Does anyone care to touch upon this further?
Yes, that is correct.
Yes, thank you, Miss Ratched. Since our last meeting I have been reflecting, quite seriously, on the nature of my problem. Naturally, I'm referring to the capacity to obtain the necessary results in order to obtain... No, no. To personify the very existence of that relationship regardless of the function...  Regardless of the function, we will confront the question of... Yes. Yes. The question of... Existence... Relationship... Function... Confront... Yes, confronting us in the moment of deepest crisis... Yes, the crisis of our souls. Of our souls, which I am trying to fully understand the problem... the problem. Not to shut ourselves off, but somehow... Somehow to understand fully our capacity... to obtain... to personify... the question... existence depends... depends on the question... to reflect... to reflect...
I-I-I...
You should have thought about that before you brought that woman in here!
Sh-sh-she did! Everybody did!
Mister Washington.
Yes, ma'am.  Lead the way, Sam.
Yeah, well, it just pains me somethin' awful to see a full growed man sloshing around in his own water...
Right... I've been givin' some serious consideration to what you told me about the democratic something of this therapeutic community of ours, an' I got a few things I wanna get off my chest, before we get back to Harding's problem.
He's into his wind-up. Here's the next pitch... and it's a hit! It's a hit!
Mr. McMurphy, you had no right to take these men out with you!
Certainly, Mister McMurphy, with pleasure.
Thank you, ma'am...
Yes. Good luck, Mister McMurphy.
Thank you, ma'am.
Th-th-then y-y-you're n-n-not m-m mad?
Ease up on the star drag, keep the tie up, up and work hell outta that fella.
Yeah, well, let me tell ya somethin'... While I was up there gettin' in-lightened, I came up with one hellava plan...
Ah-ah-ah-are y-y-y-you g-g-g-going t-t-t-to muh-muh-muh-marry her?
Marry who?
Candy? Hell no, Billy, she's just a good friend, that's all...
Wu-wu-wu I-I-I-I th-th-think sh-sh sh-she's th-th-th-the ma-ma-ma-most bu-bu-bu-beautiful wu-wu-wu-woman in th-th-the whole world!
Yeah...
It's okay, Rose. You can go with him.
Hey, what's that?
Come here a minute, Cheswick. You, too, Sefelt. Hey, all you guys, come over here, I wanna show you somethin'.
Does that mean we have to cut him loose?
Through the ass.
Now, what would I be trying to say?
You heard me the first time!
Yeah... Okay, stand aside, you guys! You're usin' up my oxygen!
I'm busting outta this place.
That's nice. Send me a post card.
Scanlon out!
Well, if you gentlemen will excuse me, I have some pressing matters to attend to.
Just wait till you hear...
When?
No. Me! Me!
No.
Poker!
I'm afraid not.
It's just medication, Mister McMurphy, good for you. Now down it goes...
Don't get upset, Mister McMurphy...
No, 'fraid not...
I don't believe it...
Gimme those dice. I'll blow this board to pieces. Here we go...  Lebenty leben, count me over eleven, Martini...
No...
Are you a doctor?
Hit, you say? Well well well and with a king up, the boy wants a hit. Whadaya know. So comin' at you and too bad, a little lady for the lad and he's over the wall and down the road, up the hill and dropped his load.
Big man!
Yes, ma'am...
I'm sure you will.
Oh...
Thank you.
Ah, no, ma'am... well, yes, ma'am...  A man get awful lonely at night, if ya know what Ah mean, ma'am...
Yes, ma'am...
That!
Si.
Your mother.
Of course not.
Okay, ma'am, just a moment.
Buona notte.
Is he some kind of celebrity or something?
Yes.
We found each other, didn't we?
Yes.  We did.
My name isn't Damon Bradley.  I just told you it was Damon Bradley.
Exactly.
Dwayne Pinsley.  From high school. That's how I knew you were here. When you called, from the airport.
Ha un numero di telefono?
That's it.  That's it.  That's all I need to know.  Bless you, thank you, thank you.
Wait.  I have to write this down.
If I live here, then he lives here. Fate wouldn't make a mistake like that.  And stop talking.  You're gonna ruin the spell.
Okaaaaayyyy.
No.
What?...
Hi there...
I take it things didn't work out between the two of you?
Hm.
Right.  Thanks a lot.  And congratulations.  It's not easy finding love these days.
Yes.
So?!  Is there something wrong with loving somebody who's safe?
Oh no, I don't think that would be a good idea.
Look, I know there's no going back for us.  That's not it.  I just want to make this up to you.  Clear my relationship karma.  And I know the area, I've got some cousins down there.  Please.  Let me do this for you.  Let this be my gift to you.
Yeah.
What are you doing here?
Actually, I think I prefer Katherine Hepburn.
No.  Course not.
No.  Are you're leaving?
Are you asking me out?
And I can't believe you are so stubborn and so blind as to let some stranger, some phantom you've never even met destroy it.
I brought you that, too.
Well, not exactly...
Would you be willing to have dinner with me?
You like shrimp?  I like shrimp.
No.  He smokes.
How about the other one?  His friend.
Metaphorically, I still don't have an Amana freezer.
No, Faith.  They came out of somebody's imagination.
I don't know.  I don't think so.
So?...
Is that bad?...
It's a coincidence.
You're just going to fly to Italy and start combing the streets?
He was on his way to Venice, right? I called the tourist bureau and I must've called every hotel in the city, but I found where he's staying. 
Faith, I've seen it already, okay? If I spot somebody who's got a head that's an eighth of an inch around, standing underneath a tuba, I'll recognize him from the photo. Otherwise, I'm telling you, it's not gonna do me any good.
He fell out.
A rich, possibly fat, slob.
Only, it's in Italian...
What's that supposed to mean?...
What's she saying?
I never even got to be single.
Sure you did.
Faith.  So far you've trailed the man halfway around the globe.  At this point, I don't think another fifteen feet is gonna tip the scales.
Good luck.
I meant about my idea.
Don't be silly.  How's a psychiatrist gonna find him?
Why?
Okay, a lot of bad luck.  But that means the odds are probably in your favor now.  This is no time to give up.
So you're just quitting?  Just like that?
It was a ouija board, remember?
I'm sure.  And Kate, thank you for coming.  Thank you for being such a good friend.
It means you're a completely worthless excuse for a human being, and the fates have all conspired to make you miserable.
So.  I guess I've got a wedding to go to.
She's saying he's a-- a--  porco.
You see, in America they care for work, they live to work.  But in Italy, they care for food, for love, for pleasure...
What do the years matter?  I've known you for centuries...
That's exactly what you are.
Right.
And we didn't have to bring another present?
Whatever.  And I thought, please God, give me a sign, give me some way to keep this woman from getting into that taxi and disappearing from my life forever.  And He did. She told me the name.  Granted, it wasn't my name, but it was a start.
Sorry...
I'd get over there, Terry. I'll take the little lady home.
If I talk too loud it's the fault of the nuns.
I know what's eatin' you, kid. But I got two thousand dues-payin' members in my local that's seventy-two thousand a year legitimate and when each one of 'em puts in a couple of bucks a day to make sure they work steady well, you figure it out. And that's just for openers. We got the fattest piers in the fattest harbor in the world. Everything that moves in and out we take our cut.
Gimme.
Thanks for the legal advice, Charley. That's what we always kept you around for.  Now how do we keep him from giving this testimony? Isn't that the er as you put it main order of business?
That was the idea.
They feel you've been sort of left out of things, Terry. They think it's time you had a few little things going for you on the docks.
And for all that dough I don't do nothin'?
I know. I know.
Well, then, you know Cousin Johnny isn't going to jeopardize a setup like that for one rubber-lipped
Four thirty-seven that isn't where Gerry G...?
I always had a bet down for you. You saw some money.
I wish I knew, Edie, But 
Don't turn away! Look at it! You're in this too don't you see, don't you see? You're in this too, Father.
I'm afraid I spoke out of turn last night.
Give it to me my Pop's job
Things 're lookin' up on the docks, huh, Jackie?
Which side are you with?
A teacher! Dong!!!  You know I admire brains. Take my brother Charley. He's very brainy. Very.
Man, you were a mess!
I don't know.
The things that go on.
Why, Terry, who said it was?
Well, nobody, I guess. But that Father Barry, I didn't like the way he kept lookin' at me.
You've been off in daisyland, honey. Everybody's got a racket.
That goes double for me.
It was Johnny Friendly who killed Joey, wasn't it?
I'm tryin' to keep you from being hurt What more do you want?
Go ahead, wear it.
Edie...
I didn't say I didn't love you. I said stay away from me.
Edie, Edie, I...
I'm looking for Charley. I heard Charley was waiting for me.  Charley?
Who is he, Pop?
He tries to act tough, but there's a look in his eyes that... .
You think we kept you out in Tarrytown just to have you go walkin' with a corner saloon hoodlum like Terry Malloy? Now get back to Tarrytown, before I put a strap to you.
You are like
I don't get it!
But it's my own brother they're askin' me to finger and Johnny Friendly. His mother and my mother was first cousins. When I was this high he took me to the ball games... .
You go to hell.
Father, one thing you got to understand. On the dock we've always been D 'n D.
What?
You want to know something I would have taken Wilson
I'm just resting my feet.
Looping right! I never swung wild. I was strictly a short puncher hooks over 'n under   whop-whop!
I ought to belt you one, J.P.
Boy, you must've been up early.
Yeah, once they're mated they stay together all their lives until one of 'em dies.
Keep the advice. Give me the whiskey.
Well I got to watch myself these days. Know what I mean?
I'll see you on the roof.
Gimme.
It was a big nothing! The Father did all the talking.
You mean Kayo Nolan, the old timer? He doesn't know much.
He don't, huh?  Well, he knows thirty-nine pages worth of our operation.
How'd you get that.
From where you stand, maybe. But I'm standing over here now. I was rattin' on myself all them years and didn't know it, helpin' punks like you against people like Pop and Nolan an'... .
Who's to say my monsters aren't alive?
What help will that do if something in there isn't dead?
Don't let them hear you.
Nothing is worth your life.
I don't know, yet.  We'll just have to watch our chance. When it comes I'll know what to do--I hope I'll know what to do.
<i>Him!</i>  I'll bet he sleeps with all the lights on.
A situation easily remedied.
Her dance has pleased me.
Oh, yes, a religion of sorts.
At your discretion...But first, I desire more entertainment.
The moon is almost gone!
There are others.
Yes, sir, Master.
Till it's not funny any more.  What do you want, Jack?
What's free about it?  I'm looking for work.
And the one driving the other car?
Yes, it is.
They didn't <i>tell</i> me anything, they asked questions.
But you know what I'm talking about, don't you?  About Glenn, don't you, and the second car?
Why not?
He'd call every once in a while.
Till they got busted.
Yeah, I was Emil's box-jumper for almost four years.
You were his what, his box?
His assistant.
Why you want to do that, to a frien'?
Just that she got away.
And you know they're gonna have some people watching the hotel.
In here with my suntan lotion and beach towel.  That's her place.
Sure looks that way.
I been thinkin', if I was Glenn, I was up there to take down the Ripper, where would I go?
She came up here on her vacation, 'cause she likes shitty weather.
Just hung up.
Forty-five minutes.
Let fate decide?  What're you, the fuckin' Dali Lama now?
Yeah, I did.
I'm not leaving you alone with these assholes.
And then they'll kill 'em.
This fella holds you hostage, you talk about movies?
I have to qualify, is that it?
I'm at Adele Delisi's.
They're in 7D.
What?  Daniel, I wanna go upstairs.
And you let them come up.  You don't try to make the bust yourself.  You understand?
If you move, if you look at her again, you're dead.
I told you, man, Super Bowl Sunday.
Why you think is today?
Freezing.  But I'm getting warmer.
No, I didn't know that.
Detroit, you must be pretty busy.
Company, shit.  I watch the man's back.
I bet.  How much?
Let's go outside and talk.
I thought everything.
You got two minutes, that's all.  Make up your mind.
Break and enter, shit.  Take it and git, how it's done.  Don't waste any time.  That's how you do it.
A little.
One I gave him, yeah.  Fuck...
I know the difference.  You were in Lompoc USP, the federal penitentiary. I've delivered people there.  So basically you've spent half your life in prison.
What do you want me to do?  Scream?  I don't think it would help much.  I'm just gonna sit back, take it easy, and wait for you to screw up.
You're full of interesting facts, aren't you?
Bleeding on a country road.
That's my dad.
You won't do that.
Why not?
I'm partial to mountains myself.  But if you like islands, we'll make it an island.
I just thought maybe you and me could--
I'm a sales rep.  I came here to call on a customer and they gave me a hard time because I'm a girl.
I like your hair.  And that suit.
You did?
How far do we go with this?
It's not a game.  Something you play.
I called your room from downstairs.
If I remembered you.  I came looking for you.  I would've said sure, let's do it.  But for all you knew I could show up with a SWAT team.  Why would you trust me?
You kept touching me, feeling my thigh.
I told you, I'm not going back.
Oh, nuthin'.
I see better with them on.
These guys, man, they're crazy.  Shit.
I expect you to look out for me, Pup, let me run off work details.
Looks like tonight.
I do, but I won't tell you just yet. Meet me in the chapel at eight-thirty, right before lock-down.
Plus, even it was true, he'd still have to figure out where I keep 'em.
Jack, I'm disappointed.  I guess I misjudged you.
Maurice?  From Lompoc?  Good God.
The <u>ninth</u>?
Ten, you count the prison hospital in Ohio I walked away from.
I don't know.  It's a long way down to Florida.
Glenn?
Glenn, take the exit.
Rippin' off Ripley was my idea, but these guys, man, they're into shit I can't handle.
I know, you'll find me.  Jesus, I believe it.  I keep thinking if you hadn't driven me to federal court last summer, you wouldn't even know who I am.
Gimme another hint.
It's Richard Ripley.
You just ask me how we gonna do it. That's what I'm here for, tell you how.  We the experts.
I can tell.
You know your divisions.  You like the fights?  Like the rough stuff?  Yeah, I bet you do.  Like to get down and tussle a little bit?  Like me and Tuffy, before she got run over, we use to get down on the floor and tussle.  I say to her, "You a good dog, Tuffy, here's a treat for you."  And I give Tuffy what every dog love best.  You know what that is? A bone.  I can give you a bone, too, girl.
You're not my type.
Well, <i>he</i> ain't even here that much.  I like to know where he goes, but at the same time I don't <i>want</i> to know, you understand?
Can't.  I gotta drive out to Glades, then I'm meeting Ray Nicolet at ten.
Which one is that?  The ATF guy?
Technically.  They're separated.
How 'bout I come next Sunday and watch the Super Bowl with you?
The Sig Sauer you got me for my birthday.
Foley <i>kid</i>napped me.
I didn't have time.
So what I want to know is why Buddy still calls his sister every week even after she turned him in.
None I'd like to share.
He's in Florida.  Palm Beach.
Yeah, as soon as we got back.
Whoever.  The point is, prices are goin' up, too.  Better get your little black book out, Richard.  We got some business to talk about.
Still...
Forget about her.  Tell me where the money's at.
I sent these two looking for him, they come back shaking their heads.
Not anxious to die, Sir, anxious to matter.
Yes Sir.
Anthony, Red, stay with the guns!  Coma, you cover the cannons!  Joe, Theo, come with us!  Earl, you get on the radio! We're gonna fight these fuckers.
Kill the bastards!
Good shooting, Rafe!
I don't mean how'd you do the paperwork, I mean how the hell did you do it without letting me in on it?
What color flowers you want me to bring to your funeral?
We'll be loaded with 2,000 pounds of bombs and 1,500 pounds of fuel.  I got another Chinese phrase for Doolittle. "Mug wump rickshaw mushu pork."  It means "Who the fuck thought up this shit?"
And I'm on yours.  Land of the free.
Who's gonna to that?  Japan is four thousand miles away.  So you guys just arrived, huh?
I left my Mama and joined the Navy to be a man.  They made me a cook -- and not even that, really -- I clean up after the other sailors eat.  I shine the officer's shoes.  In two years, they've never even let me fire a gun.
Nice to meet you, Betty.
There've been some complications, Sir. The Chinese didn't receive our request for homing beacons until is was too late to get them set.  And the planes had to take off so early they may lack fuel to make the mainland anyway.
Stag movies. Smokers.
The last one was six hundred years ago. It's about time for another one.
This is my old friend Carol.. I told you about her.
How do you like my hair?
Why are you so nervous? What is the matter with you today?
Peggy Sue!
We did for a long time. We just got married too young, and ended up blaming each other for missing out on things.
After you got knocked up, my mother didn't want me to talk to you. She thought it was contagious.
Oh, it's not so bad. I have two wonderful kids, my own business.  Still, knowing what I know now, if I had the chance to do it all over again, I'd sure do things a lot differently.
Go on. You can do it.
Come on. What's with you and Michael?
What happened?
Michael Fitzsimmons! Is he here?
Why do guys do such stupid things?
I'm still waiting for the mortgage check.
Hey, I can take a hint. You look great today.
Why wait?
They'll learn to live with it.
Thanks.
Great, isn't it?
He's trying.
Let's go down to the basement.
Then it's true, dammit! I had a miserable time tonight 'cause of you. When the Monotones did "Book of Love  Chapter Four you break up, won't you give it just one more chance..." I'm thinking Did we break up? 'Cause if we did, I don't even know about it!. I thought we cleared all that up yesterday. Did that Maynard G. Beatnik give you what you wanted?
Look, I've got the hair, got the eyes, got the teeth, I got the car. I'm the lead singer, I'm the man.
That won't make any difference. We just can't live together. And you had the nerve to drive up with that bimbo Janet.
You don't know zip! You think I'm going to end up selling appliances like my father? Chasing women around the store. I've got to give it a shot. Why are you trying to kill the two things that mean the most to me? Until yesterday you loved me and you loved us.  ) What the hell has changed? For two years I've done nothing but love you. I'll show you, I'm going to be just like Fabian!
How'd you know about that?
Hey. I guess there's a lot of things we don't know about each other.
Fat chance. You know, Lee Wilkins came to hear me last night. He told me to forget it. You told me to forget it. My parents tell me to forget it.
I know.
What the hell is that?
That's over. I got tired of translating everything. She thought the Big Hopper was a hamburger.
Don't try to charm me, Charlie Bodell.
Hello, sir. How are things at the hat store?
What would that be, sir?
Take a long walk on a short pier.
Okay.
Right now you're just browsing through time. Choose the things you'll be proud of. The things that Last.
I wish I had the nerve. And the figure.
I'd love to.
Utah? I thought you'd be going to New York or Paris. What's in Utah?
Mom, is there any coffee left?
Yes but I was a boy. And I still had hell to pay.
Listen Dad, please. Buy IBM, buy Polaroid, buy Apple Computer. No, no. Not yet. Buy Xerox!
Open it.
It's hard to believe you're going to be eighteen.  Want an eskimo pie? Or a creamsicle? I'd come home from the store and there's little you running up to me. I'd give you a dime and you'd promise never to grow up.
Quiet today?
Richard Nixon's going to be President. Nixon wears hats.
Mr. Fitzsimmons is a very prominent man.
How do you feel?
Mom!
Sure, Mom.  Hello.
He's a liar! He has no such thing! It's my own fault. I should have had it patented first. He's a crook, damnit.
I'm just happy to see you.
Rosalie, please, listen to me! You have to stop.
I was once. Richard!? Richard Norvik? I didn't recognize you.
Where's Charlie? I was in town about a year ago and caught one of his commercials. Really made me laugh.
You were always friendly to me. I appreciated that.  You know, this used to be a fantasy of mine.
What was?
Dancing with you.
I guess part of us never really leaves high school.
I'm not doing any tutoring this year. I'm too busy.
Well, I think time is like a burrito. Sometimes it just folds over on itself and one part touches the other.
That's why I was getting a divorce..  What I really think is that I had a heart attack at the reunion and died.
Look it's very simple. You tell me everything that hasn't been invented yet, and I'll invent it. We'll be partners. Fiftyfifty.
The wave of the future! I've decided on our first fortune! I'll see you later. You just think high tech.
Jogging. I was running, now I'm jogging.
Everything. This is perfect. The subconscious mind remembers all. You can give me more information on microchips and then pinpoint what happened at the reunion. Maybe that'll give us a clue on how to get you back.
Yes, every day.  Maybe I shouldn't have worn that dress? I told Beth it was a bad idea. That's why they made me Queen.
God dammit! How'm I gonna got out of here?
It's all, gone wrong, nothing's working out.
Did you break up with Charlie?
You can't. You're going to be Valedictorian.
Exactly! I thought it might be some sort of blood condition... immune deficiency or...
Not this dog. There wasn't enough oxygen in those red cells to pump life into a flea.
Well we're glad to have you, Marjorie. You can call me Chase, by the way.
I had a little run-in with Zowie.
All set.
Is he gonna be okay?
He pissed me off.
Stepdad. Gus is my stepdad.
Why not?
It's like he's not Gus anymore. He's different. You know, like Zowie...
Charles is right behind me.
Maybe you mistyped the name when you were saving it. We'll try combinations of those letters...
Andy?
Some people think you have an attitude problem, Beckett.
Oh, you're right, Beckett, you don't have an attitude problem.
He's not sorry, okay, fine.  Why don't we see what we find out from the blood work? I'll work on getting a specimen, I'm sure hospital food could help in that direction. Maybe, by then, we'll hear from my doctor, and we'll go from there. Okay? Everybody happy?
I said, "Everyone's going to die, Jimmy. But Drew's not going to die of AIDS. There's a cure around the corner, and he plans to be around to take advantage of it."
Close the law book.
CLOSE THE FUCKING LAW BOOK!
Then, what <u>are</u> we, Drew?! The <u>winners</u>? "Ladies and gentlemen, the first prize of AIDS goes to Andrew Beckett and his lover Miguel..." Excuse me, I'm not your lover. I'm your Care Partner. FUCK!
It's okay. Can I sit down?
I misplaced an important complaint. That's their story. Want to hear mine?
I dove back into work, everything was fine. Until the lesions started...
Makeup.
They didn't fire her?
Arline decision. Supreme Court.
Let's review these notes for your testimony. We have a big day on Monday.
Uh huh...
Beckett?
I know a good probate lawyer.
Except... you were gay?
Can you explain <u>why</u> you didn't?
I'm an excellent lawyer.
What makes you an excellent lawyer?
I love the law. I know the law. I excel at practicing it. It's the only thing I've ever wanted to do.
What?
Do you take risks?
Yes.
I guess it was 1984, 85.
Did you keep a picture of your lover on your desk?
One. Here, in front of my ear.
Hi, Mom. It's me.
Yes. I'm now in charge of the paralegal department.
Well... One time, Mr. Wheeler's secretary, Lydia, told me Mr. Wheeler had a problem with my earrings.
What did you say?
I'll withdraw.  You were aware, when you worked with Maria Torres, that she had AIDS, correct?
Right.
... we've got a committee meeting.
People who want to bend the rules...
Do I look gay to you? Relax.
Give me the camera, Joe.
How many do you know?
Okay, Joe...
Very funny. I had a box of Pampers under my arm for Chrissake!
Two men making love... ? Now tell me again... <u>why</u> is that disgusting?
Like... two sailors playing hide the salami.
So you are aware of the difference between a lesion and a bruise, is that correct?
I felt, and still feel, nothing but the deepest sympathy and compassion for people like Maria, who have contracted this terrible disease through no fault of their own.
With all due respect, Your Honor... We don't live in this courtroom, do we?
No. We don't... However, as regards this witness, I'm going to sustain the defense's objection.
Kings are out of fashion. I'd rather be thought of as a benevolent tyrant.  It's an anti-trust action.
He died fast. And if we got any choice, that's the way we should all go out.  Don't you cry for Johns. Don't you dare.
Assailing my fragile sense of security, that's what.
Four fulls, one half. That mean we're halfway there? I hope?
Then where is he? He's not in the hole. We looked.
Strange, not doin' a run-up on the main drive yet.  Strange unless he told you the particulars of my escape.
Entered our minds.
What it's gonna be like when we hit that canyon. With her bleeding.
We can't make it.
Just give me your hand.
Cargo hold, everyone in the cargo hold. lesgo, lesgo, lesgo.
Spirits. Anything over 45 proof burns well.
Awright. So maybe we'll have enough light.
We just keep him locked up forever?
What'd Owens mean? 'Bout not touching the switch?
During the landing...when things were at their worst...Owens was at his best. He's the one who wouldn't let the pilot dump the passenger cabin.
Wait for what? Until it's so dark we can't even find our way back to --
You mean, if he learns that you're gonna royally fuck him over.
-- we need a fail-safe. Bring the cells over at the last possible minute -- when the wings are ready, when we <u>know</u> we're ready to launch.
And here you got two mornings every day. Wow, were you <u>born</u> lucky?
Not a problem unless you're gonna make --
What the hell's it matter?
Would you RAG YOUR STUPID HOLE!
70 seconds! You still got 70 seconds to level this beast out!
Frightening thought.
And you're certain you can find the way back? Even in the dark?
Do what I say. Please.
There is no "safe."
For what? The honor of goin' back to some asshole of a cell?
If you were me, I'd kill us both. C'mon, you wanna sit at the grown-up table or not?
So which one caught your eye?
Just wonderin' if we don't need a bigger piece of chum.
Just wanted his O-2.  Though I notice he tried to ghost my ass. When he shot up that stranger instead.
What, it's broken?
You still don't believe me, do you?
I know ... Nevertheless, I thank you for saving us. You'll be in trouble for going there.
Remembers what?
The blood transfusion.
Zira, are you trying to get my head cut off?
Okay. If there's no life here, we've got just seventy-two hours to find it. That's when the groceries run out.
Blessed are the vegetarians.
What do you mean, made it? I'm an animal psychologist, that's all. We don't have any authority.
I'd like to know why not. You thought life on Earth was meaningless. You despised people. So what did you do? You ran away.
I think you're making a mistake.
My own purpose is to save this exceptional creature from mutilation.
This hearing is absurd! Let me tell my story...
Bailiff! Stop this outburst! Gag that monstrosity!
Mind your tongue, madame.
Stop right there. Bring me that paper.
A fort! Unconsciously, you chose a name that was belligerent.  Where were you nurtured?
I admit that where there's one mutant there's probably another. And another. A nest of them. Where's your nest, Taylor? Where are your women?
You may well call it upside down, since you occupy its lowest level. And deservedly.  The eastern desert has never been explored -- because we've always assumed that no life can exist there.  Save yourself, Taylor. Tell me -- is there another jungle beyond the Forbidden Zone?
I don't know.
I'm not protecting anybody! That hearing was a farce. What have I done?
Cease fire! Withdraw!
What evidence? No weapons were found in the cave.
Second from the left.
Of course. He saw you moving yours.
Where are they now?
Don you worry Bunny, youse a killer anyway.
Shit, I bet I been laid more'n you have.
You mean he's crazy? No more crazy'n the rest of us been out in the bush too long.
You guys trying to cure the headache by cutting off the head. 'Lias didn't ask you to fight his battles and if there's a Heaven - and god, I hope so - I know he's sitting up there drunk as a fuckin' monkey and smokin' shit cause HIS PAINS HE DONE LEFT DOWN HERE. Baaaaaaaaa! 
Out there man - behind the log.
No!
Yeah. No pain in my neck now. Feels good.
In '65 - yeah. Now...  No. What happened today's just the beginning. We're gonna lose this war...
You really think so... us?
You WHAT? Say 'gain.
Not just me... it's the way the whole thing works. People like Elias get wasted and people like Barnes just go on making up rules any way they want and what do we do, we just sit around in the middle and suck on it! We just don't add up to dry shit.
Hey O'Neill why don't you cool it, you don't have to be a prick everyday of your life, you know.
Maybe but I seen it happen at Ia Drang in '66, First Cavalry and they cut us to fuckin' pieces!  Give me three men, if I'm wrong, I can still roll up that flank.
So he got a reduced and come over here. Nam's his freedom man, Nam's his pussy. Three years he been here.
If you're gonna do it man, 'least do it right.
I don't want to hear your problems, Jackson. You'll get new men any day. Time being you make do like everybody else.
Right...
How far does this train go?
Perhaps I don't take it so lightly.
Not tonight.
What's the matter?
I'm not in the mood for dining and dancing.
I'm sure you have.
Why certainly, baby.
How careful should I be?
Don't take it so big... it isn't a tragedy.
I don't.
On a train. He said he lived here, and he offered to make a reservation for me.
There wasn't any plane.
At this time of night. It's not as bad as it looks.
Dance? Here?
Then he's got to be a detective.
So have I.
They're going to arrest me.
And Betty Mayfield--
Blonde, beautiful, and sad--and nowhere.  Of course she might have run away--if she knew how.  And where to go.  She might have dyed her hair.  Bleached it before probably.  And changed her name again.  But look at this note.  And look at her room in the hotel. Her stuff is all there.  Hasn't a rag except what she stood up in. You don't run away like that.  Not if you are young and beautiful. No chance.
That's right.
I told you my father died in jail. He stole a fortune.  Most of it pretty dirty money.  I don't care to have that known.
No.  I paid him off.
I guess I'm a little screwy.  Maybe I could believe it.  Should I try?
I'm still on course to Victoria. Nobody saw you get on board, nobody seen you since.
Mitchell was dead enough.
Would I want to?
Shut up!  Cut it out!  Even if I have to kill both of us--
Yes.  You.  You're not really a murderer yet.
If I did-I don't-now.
I don't know her.. or particularly want to.
I was born in New York City. I grew up. And here I am.
I'm sorry.
A graduation present.
Why don't you arrest me and be done with it.
They're all crude, when they don't work. Had breakfast?
Is it a crime?
Very ridiculous.
They call me Jeff.
Not quiet yet.  We know who the gun belonged to. Margo West.  She told us this morning.  It doesn't mean much.  Mitchell took it away from her.  He had a habit of going through her bag.
I always wear gloves when I shoot people.  A bad joke--but better than tears.
I'm enough of a copper to do my duty.  My boss made it tough for me.  If I don't arrest you, I've gone soft.  If I do, it's to save my face.  I don't play those rules.
This way.
I'm not interested in blind dates.
I'm still asking. What do you want?
Got it on you?
They still hang women in Canada, I've heard.
I've got good ears.
Round of golf Saturday?
Somebody Mitchell picked up on the train. I don't even know her name.
Yes, I've seen it before.
No.
No thanks. I had some. How would you like to take a walk for, say, half and hour?
I never notice the view after the first week.
Your concentrating too hard, Killaine.  What about Margo West? She had a motive.  I guess you know by this time whose gun it was?
Now and then.  Mostly just for the fun of it.
I tried it once.  I lost my shirt.
Lay off, can't you?
Lay off what? This is my new girl friend. Met her on the train. She's very fond of me. Love at first sight. Wasn't it, baby?
Convenient, isn't it?
He was very easy to hate. If you'll look in your mirror, when you are in a better temper- you'll know why.
How important would it have to be? It's only murder, Inspector.
We don't need him.
One of those nice long manila envelopes--sealed.  Not too fat- not too thin.
You get it's brother.
So it seems Sergeant.
They tell me he'll be a great loss to the liquor trade. This Mayfield girl...
I've always looked forward to it. All right, let's get him out of here and tidy up.
So?
If she didn't--if luck was against him--he wipes the gun off, reaches the wall up there--drops it on the chaise.
I never wear a hat.  Oh, so I am. I forgot.  I guess I'm terribly sorry again, Mrs. West.
Positive?
I shall. From your knowledge of Mitchell, would you say he would be likely to commit suicide?
I'd be delighted to... anytime you can show me the doubt. I'll wrap it up in tissue paper and put a Christmas seals on it for her.
Mayfield?  She fit into this?
The card says so, doesn't it?
Aye.  You have a point there.
You're a young man.  You're romantic.  You think a pretty face and a clean conscience go together. You think a soft voice means a soft heart.  You'll grow out of that.
You think I'm wrong about this bit of a girl.  Go out and prove it against me!
She's just a girl I met on the train. You don't mind do you?
Why should I mind?
You shouldn't. You washed me up very thoroughly.
You ought to know why.
Kind or not kind. What's the difference? It always ends up the same way.
Since you are a friend of my daughter's, I think I'm entitled to call you James, don't you think?
If we leave the remembering to historians then the struggle is already lost.  Everyone must have a memory, everyone needs to be a historian.  In this country, for example, we're in danger of losing hard-won freedoms by dozing off in a perpetual present.
If you like.  But don't be too modest, James.  The citizen's duty is to remember, not necessarily to write books.  You are highly qualified.  You're a responsible journalist doing what sounds to me like a very demanding job.  Every day you take decisions that depend on your sense of history.  A genuine tyranny would have to get rid of people like you.
I think you'll do very well.
Actually, we've only just met. But we're quiet good friends.
Didn't Evelyn Waugh say that the country under Atlee seemed to be under enemy occupation?
Not too bad, thanks.  How have you been?
I see.
And some of that.  Sorry.
...from all the moralising and talk of national humiliation that is now the standard line on Suez...
Freshman and sophomores...
It's everything we wanted.  A very good read.  A terrific piece of work.  So, here's to you and Suez.
I thought it was tremendous.
Very thoughtful.
Well, you should.
No.  It's a bit of a madhouse. For some reason a lot of my mother's friends specialise in monologues.
You're so hard.  All right then. I was chatting to some people from the diary page, and the name of Barrington came up.  I expressed an interest...
We've been playing ten minutes for Christ sake.
On the torture of very small children, but don't start telling them about their rights--
Hold those rights.
Will it be fun?
Are you up to something?
Hello.
Next time tell her I've gone away.
Yes.
Ploughman's Lunch.  Traditional English fare.
Darling Susan.
Oh, yes!  Where's mine?  I want to look like you.
It's because he desires you.  The women get all the breaks at these conferences.
Where?
Whoooaaah!  Shhiiittt!  Whoooaaah!
Insurance policy.  Now this is going to sting a bit, but it's for your own growth, brah.  Press play.
See!  That's what I like about you, man!  You're just sharp as a razor blade.
Good guess.  There's a gun on you right now.
I say when it's over!
Naw, you pull it!
I'm not FBI anymore.
That's right.  And we nailed over a thousand of them.  We did it by crunching data.  Good crime-scene work, good lab work, good data-base analysis.  Nobody had to tackle a car once.  You getting the signal, special agent?
The correct term is babes, sir.  Uh, this type of undercover operation is entirely dependent on picking up the idiom of the speech.  Otherwise penetration is not possible, sir. Of the social infrastructure, I mean.
That's the point, isn't it?
You watch your fucking mouth!  Mr. Hoover himself pinned the Seal of Honor right here!
Guy's the Toxic Avenger.
No.  But let's do it, anyway.  It's gonna bug the shit out of Harp.
Look, we handle it ourselves, for right now, okay?  We cover the bank, whatever.  You and me.  That way if nothing happens, or more accurately, when nothing happens... I don't get my tits any further into the wringer than they already are.
Oh, oh.  That sounds personal.
Meaning you were expendable.
You don't have to.
Never saw him, was your basic hit and run.
My name's Johnny Utah!
What do you mean?
Jesus... this is inhuman.  Uh... I wasn't told of any operations in this area. They shouldn't have been here.
We take her and she'll give away our position, every chance she gets. No prisoners, Dillon.
Expendable assets, Dillon. Seems Langley is never around when you need them.
What are you talking about? We'll be out of here in ten minutes.
We found 'em both, dead. And the gear from the chopper. If they're Central American, I'm a fuckin' Chinaman. By the looks of 'em, I'd say our cabinet minister and his aide are CIA.  Another thing, Major, we were lucky... couple of those guys we waxed are Russians, military advisors by the look of it. Something big was about to happen here.
What's that, General?
Someone else will be going in with you.
Hawkins?
There's no sign of it.
Philip!  We'll need shoes!
Twenty-five percent.
What?
I know all about you, Mr. Harris. When you buy companies, they have a way of disappearing.  Even the pension funds are stripped clean. The last three companies you took over were cut up in so many pieces, widows were left without their retirement checks.
I don't question the legality of what you do.  It's your morality that makes me sick.  I will not allow my company to be raped by a man like you.
Not bad for a man who hasn't slept in four nights.  I'll get used to it.
What?  You gonna tell me you're lost?
That's ridiculous.
If you can figure it out, be my guest.
You're not from L.A., huh?
What do you want it to be?  Vivian, my name's Vivian.
You like being a hooker, Vivian?
Tell me about it.  L.A. is suffering from a wacko epidemic. And who knows where half the guys I pick up have been.  I mean, I use condoms.  Always.  And I get checked out once a month at the free clinic.  Not only am I better in the sack than an amateur, I'm probably safer.
Very good.  You ought to have that printed up on your business card.
I never joke about money.
Neither do I.  A hundred bucks an hour though. That's pretty stiff.
Edward.  My name is Edward.
Off the boulevard.
Exactly.
Diet coke.
Do you plan everything?
They should be.  They're both good at it.
Jesus, you act like you're seducing some Valley girl you picked up in a dance club.
Vivian... the meter's running... cooperate.
Just a romantic, that's you.
Occupational hazard?
I took the couch.  I had some work to do.  About last night...
Mmm, I could tell.
I sell them.
Vivian --
Three thousand for five days. And Vivian, I will let you go.
Upset.  No.  I never get upset about business.
You liked the guy, though.
Yeah, it's this box, it has pictures, sound.  You don't have to use your brain at all.
Was someone rude to you?
I think it's exciting.
I really doubt anyone here frequents Hollywood Boulevard.
He's good at what he does.
I've been with stinking old men who've made me want to puke but I've never had anyone make me feel as dirty as you did tonight.
I want my fucking money.  I'm getting out of here.  I don't want anything more to do with you.
What if I lose it?
But don't they have it in English?
Vivian, don't be afraid of what you don't know.  That's the fun of it.
I more than liked it.
I'm here.
Bill Stuckey, Vivian.  My wife, Elizabeth.
We just did.
So now they're best friends? Edward, this girl appears out of nowhere and now I see her talking to a guy whose company we're trying to buy.  It's too convenient.
Maybe we should get a pimp. Carlos likes you and --
That crack is burning a hole in your pocket.  There isn't even milk in the fridge.  The rent's due.  Now come on --
In Beverly Hills?
Carlos.  I still owe him two hundred bucks...
Oh, my god, you mean it was good?
I leave extras, miss.
They were real nice to me there. They treated me, y'know... nice. Thanks, Barney.
It's a bit beyond my... range, shall we say.
I think you'll find it normal enough.
Okay.  Thanks, Barney.  You're the best.
Come on, Barney, you and me live in the real world.  You don't know how to treat a girl like anything but a lady, Mr. Thomas.
Yes...
'Scume me.
Don't worry.  I'll pay for it. What a you charge?  Huh?  Twenty, thirty, fifty bucks, <u>maybe</u>?  Are you a fifty dollar whore?
You're a silly girl.
Brides often are, I'm told.
He knows I do not love him.
I know who you are -- your cruelty reveals everything.
Of course you will.
Nonsense -- you're only saying that because no one ever has. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           57.
It never happened.
Well, no, we sort of skipped that part.
Why do you wear a mask? Were you burned by acid, or something like that? ---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           39.
Well ...  ... you see, you use different moves when you're fighting half a dozen people than when you only have to be worried about one.
Perhaps not. I feel fine.
-- look, he bested you with strength, your greatness. He bested me with steel. He must have outthought Vizzini, and a man who can do that can plan my castle's onslaught any day. Let's go --
But you don't know where he is.
At Miracle Max's. It fit so nice, he said I could keep it.
Has it got any sports in it?
Oh. Well, thank you very much. It's very nice of you. Your vote of confidence is overwhelming. All right.  The Princess Bride, by S. Morgenstern. Chapter One. Buttercup was raised on a small farm in the country of Florin.
I don't be-leeve this.
Who gets Humperdinck?
Nobody. Nobody kills him. He lives. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           90.
I don't mind so much.
Sire.
Try ruling the world sometime.
I tell you once again -- surrender!
Tyrone, you know how much I love watching you work. But, I've got my country's five hundredth anniversary to plan, my wedding to arrange, My wife to murder, and Guilder to frame for it. I'm swamped. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           75.
And our assets?
What's that?
That's very comforting. But I'm afraid you'll just have to wait.
Again. Thank you.
I ought to be after twenty years.
Okay.
Inconceivable!
You keep using that word -- I do not think it means what you think it means.  My God! He's climbing.
You're that smart?
I'm not a witch, I'm your wife. But after what you just said, I'm not even sure I want to be that anymore.
Roger, do you mind if we talk a little business?
Please, please, that's what we're here for.  Be careful, that hurt.
Get on the phone.  Send out a casting call.  Call every agent in town.  I want to see everybody. Everybody.
Well, sir, it seems ...
Yes, Prince Mishkin, what can we do for you?
According to the backer's list you raised $60,000.  But the show you produced only cost fifty-eight thousand.  There's two thousand dollars unaccounted for.
Now let's see, if we add these figures, we get ...
What scheme?
You miserable, cowardly, wretched little caterpillar.  Don't you ever want to become a butterfly?  Don't you want to spread your wings and flap your way to glory?
What???
What are you afraid of?  I'm not going to hurt you!  What's the matter with you?
I already have.  Come on.
Well, Max, I don't know, Max.  What do you think, Max?
Run a week?  Are you kidding?  This play has got to close in the first act.
What is she gonna do here?
Roger De Bris.  Roger De Bris.  Oh yes, the director.  Is he good... I mean bad?
Only if we ask him.
Why don't we go over to the theatre and see what's really happening? After all, we've only heard from a small portion of the audience. Let's hear what the majority thinks.
Mr. Liebkind, wait ...
We loved it.  We thought it was a masterpiece.  That's why we're here. We want to produce it on Broadway.
All right, but remember, if you damage the Fuhrer's reputation, I kill you.
You crazy lunatic!  What are you shooting at us for?  Why don't you use this  where it will do us some good?  Why don't you shoot the actors?  Liebkind, have I ever steered you wrong?
Always.
Yes.  Amazing isn't it?
Of course I need you.  It's dark in there.
Got dag pa dig.
You can count on me-o, you dirty young man.
Oh, I'd better hurry back.  I don't want to miss one minute of it.
Wagner...
Nietzche...
Bismark...
What have you done, LSD?
Hey, baby, that's where they put me, Sing-Sing.  How'd you know that, you been up?
Send for Goebbels.
I didn't think the police went searching for people who weren't in trouble.
Oh.
I don't even bother with guests registering any more... I mean, little by little, you drop the formalities.  I shouldn't even bother to change the linen. I guess habits die hard. Which reminds me...
How did she pay you?
What?
And when she left, she never came back.
I don't know what you expect me to know about... people come and go...
Money.
Not even a hunch. Just hope.
You can do anything you've a mind to... and bein' a woman, you will!  That yours?
Aha! Always got time to argue money, huh...?
I'd really rather not. Please.  Can't we just settle this and...
I'd like to be ready when he gets back.
I don't need pills... just sleep.
No, Mr. Lowery... but then she's always a bit late on Monday mornings.
Now. Your sister is missing how long?
Just what he told your detective.
I want to know if my sister is here.
Where?
And you thought she'd come up here, to me? If she had, what reason would she have for not calling you?
It was her boss' idea not to report it to the police?
He must have had a darn good reason for wanting them kept out of it... All that cash...
He's the Deputy Sheriff around here.
Yes.  But maybe this proves that Bates found out about the money.
Bates.
Checking out time is three P.M. Hotels of this sort aren't interested in you when you come in, but when your time's up...  Sam, I hate having to be with you in a place like this.
When you're married you can do a lot of things deliberately.
I'm sorry, Mary.  My old Dad used to say 'when you can't change a situation, laugh at it.' Nothing ridicules a thing like laughing at it.
I've lost my girlish laughter.
I wish I were. Not an active criminal but... a nice guy with the conscience of a criminal.  Next best thing to no conscience at all.
I have to go, Sam.
I'm thinking of it.
I was born in mine. I don't mind it anymore.
No, not like me.
Wouldn't it be better if you put her in... someplace...
Crane.
That's it. 
Good night.
Then I'm free to go...?
Frankly, yes.
Now wait just a moment! Turn your motor off, please.
You didn't!  It's tinkerbell.  Al wants to be sure he'll hear it if anyone rings it in the middle of the night.  Well come on in, at least!
Let's go out back and have some coca while the men are talking.
Norman took a wife?
I'd know the difference between Mary and an old woman.
Norman found them dead together.  In bed.
Satisfied with your cabin?
Buy a new one! In a new town! Where you won't have to hide your mother!
Leave me alone!
Mother, she's just a stranger!  As if men don't desire strangers, as if... oh, I refuse to speak of disgusting things because they disgust me! You understand, Boy?
He wasn't out when you were there. He just wasn't answering the door in the dead of night... like some people do. This fellow lives like a hermit...
It is--you know what a struggle he's had.
You say a fortune. He never spoke to me of any rich relatives.
Sh--sh--I want to have a few words with you quietly.
Who are you? What is your name?
You're not as quick as I thought. I figgered out that rats breed faster than cats-- cat skins make good fur-- The cats eat rats. Rats eat raw meat. That is, they eat the carcasses of the cats. So --the cats eat the rats--the rats eat the cats. And I get the skins--simple ain't it?
Oh, Maxwell? He's left.
Yeah, he was picked up-- also the body from the morgue. Say, what did you have to do with stealing that body?
So--that's it. Buckley took the body.
It won't do any good. They are a pair of would-be mur- deresses fighting it out.
Man, you're crazy. What kind of a place is this?
No, you can't do that--they'll get suspicious--
Go to sleep!
Yes!
There's no child here.
Another fragment of the diary is shown [having to do with vampires].
I met one last night ... all the money this side of Peoria.
I don't agree with you.
What's the rush? There's no first act. They'll all be there and we don't have to appear at any particular time.
I'm hungry. I'll eat the first child I see. And I've an appointment with young Winton at 8:30.
Well, that's just how stupid I am. When you go riding, it will be with me. And if it's with someone else, you can make it a permanent arrangement.
Thank you.
I'm not kidding. Joan Gale's body is packed in the box in the basement, and I saw the most horrible thing down there.
You mean he was colored?
Nothing doing. This is my percentage. You birds are going to get yours. And anyhow, I found this dump.
I wouldn't be trying, beloved. I would hang him! And another thing, all this gaga about the body disappearing. Eight bodies have been stolen in New York within the last eighteen months. Doesn't it seem more reasonable to hook this up from that angle?
And they never proved anything against him.
Whooey -- he took a run-out powder.
I want to see the original pictures of Joan Gale.
Hey, Mattie, dig into the morgue and send up all the art you have on Joan Gale.
Well, no one would ever suspect it. You don't sound right.
Almost certain.
Yes, you could. Cut out this rotten business and act like a lady. Marry me.
You used to go to Worth's place a whole lot. What makes you sure it wasn't there?
Fine. You're the first reporter in here for two hours. You people seeing the old year out?
Oh, yeah? Maybe she didn't commit suicide. She may have been murdered!
No foolin' -- any suspect?
Nothing. Only she may have tried to blackmail him. You know such things have happened. Anyway, he was at her apartment a few hours before she was found dead.
Don't worry -- she'll get used to it.
For a few minutes the afternoon before -- before --
Uh-huh. Do you remember what she said? What did you talk about?
You weren't going with her?
Hold on, hold on. I'm trying to help you, if you're on the square, and I think you are.
Not even if it gives you a clean bill of health?
Not even then. The police are the proper people to conduct this affair. Now if you've got any suspicions I'll drive you to the nearest police station.
I told you what to do. Drive around the corner out of sight of the house. I want to get a closer look at the place.
Good night.  And I am very grateful to you.
He can't hear you.
You taking any medication?
Spare me your classical answer. Measurements in.  Results taken.  What if I didn't miss?
I could go out of town.
What?
There was this old man that ate his niece.
That was very interesting. Thank you, Rose.
Who would want to do such a thing as that?
There's an evil streak in everybody, Rose.
Rose, since you're here in bed with me and everything and I've already touched your titty...
I said I wouldn't.
Rose, you are too uncritical of people.
You don't know the bedside manner that man has got. Why, it does me good just to see him sit there all solemn and go pokin' in his bag like he's gonna cure me, which he did of course. And even more important he loves me, like a patient I mean, the other day he got tears in his eyes just listenin' to my heart beat.
Buddy, I'm scared, I'm scared!
Oh, Waski, you don't know anything.
All right, what do you know?
Quiet, you little muddy-eyed brat, or Ill kill you!
Yeah, he's still up there.
All right, all right. Doll and Waski are upstairs taking their nap, you go get them and bring them down to the living room. Where is the girl?
What did you say, Brother?
Yes, I did, mother. Your hearing aid isn't working right. I said ahhh-dam stuff.
I do wish you'd speak to Brother. It's true he's been looking at those horrible little books again.
I'll be right back.
Boy! Wow!
Is that all?
That's the least of her troubles. Rose had a rare tropic disease and the little tubes in her that babies swim down are all stopped up, she told me all about it.
Um-hmm, and I suppose that incensed you?
Not for long, boy. I've outstayed my welcome already.
She was fifty-six, son. Of course she didn't look it, nowhere near it. The cancer came back, I'm afraid I fibbed about that. But it was very quick, son. She was in the hospital only two weeks, and the last week she didn't know anything.
I know. You loved her. So did I. It was an awful shock to me, too. An awful shock. Rose was so alive it's hard to believe.
That's all I want to know.  Lets get out of here before I get the epizootics myself. Thank you, Doctor, for your discourse, it was fascinating, no doubt.
I have of course observed the girl in treating her.
Your hearing aid, it's buzzing at me like a snake.
I asked you what you think of Rosebud, now that she's been here a while.
Hope for the best? I don't understand all this skepticism. I thought you liked Rose.
Yes, of course.
Well, time will tell, won't it?
Darlin', it is not my fault if the girl has epizootics --
I don't intend to fire her, darlin'.
It's because of the children she's got to go. I don't want to be holier-than-thou, but the girl doesn't have the same outlook we do. Morals don't mean a thing to her, not a thing, and we can't have a girl like that in this house.
Well, I have a pretty good idea.
You don't like him because he's a Yankee. He's a brilliant doctor.
But she must know... unless... unless... Rose, was there more than one person?
What did you forget?
Rose isn't oversexed, that's ridiculous. If you're going to talk nonsense, I don't want to talk to you at all. Rose is exactly the same as the rest of us, except more so.
Fine.
I don't understand it. Even in the wild days she was never as late as this.
Well, yes, she's happy. Of course Dave doesn't have her life force, not at all. There isn't much furniture in his house, just a table and one or two chairs, whereas Rose has furniture coming out of the windows.
Oh, I don't know, I... I...
Don't make me... me... me... get up!
Do you know what a friend you have got there? Do you know she would fight for you like a tiger, that she would fly to your defense in an instant with all the courage in her soul if anyone tried to hurt you? Is this any way to repay her trust and love? Are you ashamed as I am ashamed?  Don't cry, honey, don't cry. But let me warn you, damn your hide, this is Thermopylae and I am standing here. Do you hear me, damn you. I am standing at Thermopylae and the Persians shall not pass! Now get your tail out of here and go wash those dishes, and stop crying!
It'll do just fine.  Bye-bye, see you later.
All right, thanks to her, and thanks to this case of epizootics, you are getting another chance.  But don't try my patience again. We have growing children in this house. Do you understand me?
Umm. Well. Yes. But no more strange voices in the night, Rose.
Oh, no, sir.
Well, it was a silly question.
Yes, Tennessee, a lovely state!
Your baby?
Good God almighty. This is a catastrophe, they won't hire her.
I haven't had my period for three months and my stomach is getting big.
It's so, Mr. Hillyer.
Well, that's interesting, Dave. I always liked Washington, it's a pretty town.
That's right, Dave, I'm headed for Glenville on a whisperin' jet.
Dave, you are as full of shit as a Christmas turkey and you know it. Now if you want to start a fight on this plane and get yourself in jail, go right ahead. But I am telling you, you are full of shit right up to your eyeballs.
She looks terrible, just awful.
I am thinking particularly of the other ovary. As a rule I don't believe in removing it. The woman's hormonal system is profoundly disturbed, she is subject to possibly serious depression, she loses many of her secondary sexual characteristics for example, her breasts might shrink and become flabby, facial hair might appear along with a coarsening of the features, and of course her sexual drive is greatly diminished, especially in a girl or young woman. For these reasons I am opposed to removing the other ovary, as a rule. Do you follow me?
Mrs. Hillyer, this girl is sick in more ways than one. She is an extreme psychoneurotic with uncontrollable sexual impulses. It would be a mercy to spare her the suffering she causes herself and others. Therefore I recommend as a therapeutic measure the removal of her second ovary. It is ethically and medically the only proper decision in this case and I suspect your husband agrees with me.
She was raised on a poor dirt farm. I'm sure she's never seen a dentist or hardly even a doctor.
I think you're right, it would be harder on her. But you'd better call Mr. Hillyer, she's going to need help to get home.
You can stop it right now.
Yes, Ma'am.
I don't want to. When I was lyin' there in that hospital bed at death's door I says to myself, I ain't goin' out no more. If I ever get outta this, I'll just stay home.
I was going to tell him.
Put up your kickstand, freak.  Start talking, or we're out the door.
Okay, man, okay.  I'm with you.  I... I heard how the shit's arriving...  It's coming in a Lincoln.
What and?  That's what I got.
Really?  Is that a fact... ?
I don't know, okay?  All I know is Butch Cassidy's back in town.
That wasn't my fault.
I'd rather you guys didn't do this again.
I'm just saying...
Clench your teeth.
I don't know.  I could quit now if I wanted, I just don't want to.
Dean Martin.
I'm not taking a cigarette break, jackass, just give me one!
Birth control's important.
We're not stealing.  We're borrowing.
This is the police lock-up.  We're police.  How can we steal from ourselves?
Well, I got something..  Pop-Sweet's accounting ledger for the Disco-Strip.  All the money transactions.  Look...  Someone's putting their initials beside the weekly totals.  Like they're acknowledging a deposit.
You're lying...
Oh.  Well.   I think it's pretty common knowledge that in the Battle of Little Big Horn, Custer was drunk off his ass.
I'm here.  That's all that counts. Watch... you'll enjoy this... it's like magic...
Well, shake a leg.  Get these files downstairs...  And, quit listening to your fucking voodoo music.
Just 'cause you belong to some fancy-pants club, doesn't make you any less a murderer.
You think this is so easy?
Oh yeah?
I worked my ass off for my badge, Kittle,  It's the only thing that makes me different from every other slob out there.
How'd we do?
A.D. is a C.P.A.
Maybe it's enough.
I'm well aware of that.
Billy!  Billy!
Yeah?  So, what do you want to ask today that I can't answer?  I'm a busy man.
You won't get another chance at this, Admiral.
I also thought he could be turned back to the good side. It couldn't be done. He is more machine now than man. Twisted and evil.
Yes, my Master.
Everything is proceeding as I have foreseen.
Strange, that I have not. I wonder if your feelings on this matter are clear, Lord Vader.
Luke!
I gotta get you out of here.
Hey, don't worry. Chewie and me got into a lot of places more heavily guarded than this.
All right, old buddy. You know, I know what she means to you. I'll take good care of her. She-she won't get a scratch. All right?
It's against my programming to impersonate a deity.
Your father?
No, you don't. You've always been strong.
Certainly not!
I've one thing to say and that's Dammit, Janet. I love you.
I've got something to say.
For you.
Hmmm ... Well, I guess we will have to turn back.
This isn't the Junior Chamber of Commerce Brad.
They're probably foreigners with ways different from our own.  -  They may do some more folk dancing.
No, don't do that.
I hope so my darling.
I wanted to be loved completely. My body throbbed excitedly.  Oh Brad, Brad my darling, how could I have done this to you?
Yes, well perhaps it was for the best.
"Transylvania"
My high is low. I'm dressed up With no place to go.
Oh.
The delivery boy.
Ah - sweet Transexual - land of night - to sing and dance once more to your dark refrains.  To take that step to the right...
Don't say that.
Paulie, it's Thanksgiving. I've gotta turkey in the oven.
Paul.
Owe you what?
Give my main man a raise!!
Sure -- He can hit -- Don't play no more -- Stick an' move, hear?
He was big, an' very nasty so I destroyed him in a hurry -- Now I'm gettin' ready for Mac Lee Green next month.
Wait here, gotta smooth this guy out.
This a con?
Look at her, ya can see she ain't feelin' good -- needs a few minutes exercise --
It's been confirmed that it is definitely an impersonation of George Washington -- a great way to start 1976 off.
You have my food in ya hand.
Ya still light seventy.
No, two yards from Snyder, an' a grand from Cappoli.
Here's fifty bucks -- You an' the girl have a nice time.
Black market?
...Thanks.
Hey! When I was your age, there was only one girl who talked like that in the whole neighborhood.
Ya hope I don't keep acting like a whore or I'll turn into one, right?
Yeah, they're goin', -- that's nature... That was my locker for six years.
Hey, ever think about retirin'?
Hey, Mickey -- Whatta ya doin' here? Here, sit down.
How do you mean?
Look, you can't buy what I know. Ya can't. I've seen it all! I got pain an' I got experience.
...I'm doin' it for a friend.
Whatta you get outta this?
Real good.
Great, kid, great.
Listen, I'm with you -- But ya gotta talk to Mickey -- I put ya stuff in the bag over there.
Bullmastiff.
Maybe ya should see a doctor.
Ice skate.
He's takin' cheap shots.
Y'know, to help keep ya livin' clean.
How 'bout you talk to 'em about me?  Please do me that favor.
Whatta you think?
What gaps?
How're you preparing for this Bicentennial bout?
You serve martinis, doncha?
Is this paper even good?
Nope.  It's that Cloverleaf outfit again.
Yes, I find that weasles have a special gift for the work.  The rabbit didn't contact you by any chance, did he?
Have you tried Walla Walla?  Kokomo's very nice this time of year.
The other people who were in here lookin' for the will.  I woulda caught 'em if Cheetah here hadn't interrupted me.
That's what this is all about?  Tell me, who's gonna use your lousy freeway? We got the Red Cars, the best public transportation in the country.
Eddie?  Jesus, what happened?
Uh, Eddie, do me a favor.  Could you sit in the back so you won't cause as much of a commotion.
Don't worry, you're not the first.  We better get out of here.
I've already seen your photographs.
Maybe.  Why?
Stop what?
You tricked me, damn you!
Take it easy.
Oh, yeah?  Then how'd you find my house?
My philosophy is if you don't have a sense of humor, you're better off dead.
Well, Acme had the will in his pocket that night at the club.  It was gone in the morning when the cops found the body.
Well... I still don't think he'd turn me in.
Drink it, jerk.  All of it.
If I'm so smart, how come I'm runnin' from the law with a Toon?
No, it's not.
Uh? Uh?
Have patience!
Leave Me!
Then I'll leave thee.
Nay, he will answer the letter's master, how he dares, being dared.
The what?
Is the day so young?
At thy good heart's oppression.
She hath, and in that sparing makes huge waste.
Drink it off and, if you had the strength of twenty men it would dispatch you straight.
I do spy a kind of hope, Which craves as desperate and execution as that is desperate which we would prevent. If, rather than to marry Paris, Thou hast the strength of will to slay thyself, Then it is likely thou wilt undertake a thing like death, to chide away this shame. No warmth, no breath shall testify thou livest . Each part, deprived of supple government, shall stiff and stark and cold appear, like death. Now when the bridegroom in the morning comes to rouse thee from thy bed, there art thou dead. Thou shalt be borne to that same ancient vault where all he kindred to the Capulet lie. In the meantime, against thou shalt awake, shall Romeo by my letters know our drift, and hither shall he come. And that very night shall Romeo bear thee hence to Mantua. Take thou this vial, being then in bed, and this distilling liquor drink thou off. I'll send my letters to thy lord post haste to Mantua.
What if this mixture do not work at all? Shall I be married then tomorrow morning?
Hie you make haste! But look thou stay not till the watch be set, for then thou canst not pass to Mantua where thau shalt live till we can find a time to blaze you marriage, reconcile your friends, beg pardon of the Prince and call thee back with twenty hundred times more joy, than thou wentst forth in lamentation. Quick hence! Be gone by break of day! Sojourn in Mantua.
And all this day an unaccustomed spirit lifts me above the ground with cheerful thoughts. I dreampt my lady came and found me dead and breathed such life with kisses in my lips that I revived and was an emperor. Ah me, how sweet is love itself possessed when but love's shadow's are so rich in joy. News from Verona. How now, Balthasar?! Dost thou not bring me letters from the Priest? How doth my lady? Is my Father well? How doth my lady Juliet? For nothing can be ill if she be well.
Romeo, come forth.
Madam, in happy time what day is that?
Geth thee to be and rest, for thou has need.
I am a-weary, give me leave awhile: Fie, how my bones ache! what a jaunt have I!
But all this did I know before. What says he of our marriage? what of that?
I gave thee mine before thou didst request it!
I will not fail: 'tis twenty year till then.
More Light and light, more dark and dark our woes.
Thus..... with a kiss...... I die.
Verona's summer hath not such a flower.
Pardon, good Mercutio, my business was great; and in such a case as mine a man may strain courtesy.
Right.
I thought all for the best.
NO! Mercutio!
I don't know.
That's him.
I don't know...  Well I don't!  It's a goddamned mystery to me just like it is to you.  But I do know who we're working for.  My people, and the Russian mob.
Where do you get off saying word one? All the time pretending to be one of us, it's the same thing we were doing, Seamus and myself.  And here you are so high and mighty, like you're so different from the rest of us.
Should any of you decide to rush me, I'll kill myself and whoever happens to be near me at the time.
I think not.  After you...
I'll destroy whatever's in the case.
What I do is none of your concern.  What you should do is wait for my next phone call.  I'm going to find a place where I can tilt the field in my favor.  When I'm ready, I'll call you and tell you what I want you to do.
Don't cross me...
I just wanted to make sure you knew who you were dealing with.
If he hadn't you'd have put a bullet in his head a long time ago.
Well, Vincent's American friend, shall we see what we can do for you?
It gets done now or not at all.  Another couple of days and the parties concerned are gone where I can't get them.
It's been known to happen.
And you could stand to get a little smarter, ain't that right you dumb blonde fuck?
It's consider a virtue in some corners of the world.
As in, they own it?
I do.
So is the woman.
Deirdre?  Smart, yeah, and seriously goddamned dangerous.
I just wanted to see something.
See what?
I've seen a lot of people die before.
I haven't.  Not like that.  How do you get used to it?
If I was a cop, a real cop, I'd have busted you a long time ago.  This isn't about you, it's about the job I have to do.
It isn't about money for me, not anymore.
Yes I do.
I know of him.
Gimme a goddamn cigarette!!!!
Why are you driving?  You're not French, you don't live here, you don't know these roads.  Why are you driving?
Business keeps you on the road?
The mark of a true Samurai.  What I do for the Company, Vincent, is no different than what you do.  We're both hired guns, and this is a job -- like any other job.
That's a good question.
And now...
What?
You don't owe me a goddamned thing, Vincent, and you know it.  You stepped in front of a bullet for me.  I owe you a heavy debt.
It's the Irish tape we want.
Matter of face there's this flick I've been hearing about.  I haven't seen it, but from what I hear it's pretty cool.
I knew you'd come through. Jesse observes the transaction Booth and Earl start to leave.
Look around you partner!  You said yourself you never saw anything like it.
We'll figure something out.
I'll worry about that when it happens and if it happens, and it's not gonna happen!
Because...I know.
Well, I don't know.  I'm putting it out of my mind and you should too --
I don't know...
This isn't a joke. What are we going to do!
It's the right thing to do.
Neither do I.
I don't know...we have to shut him up somehow. Booth looks at Earl --
We've got to go now, then.
What do you mean?  Look.  We can make still make it work.
It's not about the money anymore. Can't you see that?  It's about
What's your offer, Jesse?
That's the deal.  If you don't like it, forget it, no one wins.
How much?
You better believe it if you know what's good for you!
You're only screwing yourselves over!  Helllllp!  HELLLLLP!  SOMEBODY!!!
And I'd take it out on him.
I know.
I'm going to quit.  That's what has to happen first.  Then we're going to tell him.
We'll meet new people. You might have friends out there you never met.
Yeah.  I want to tell you everything.
First you question my integrity, then you call me stupid...  ...that hurts, son.
Cause we got footprints leading into that brush, I want to see where it leads...  Jesus, seven dead.  I'll tell you I've never seen carnage like this in all my seventeen years of sheriffing these parts.  I don't like it.  Not in my jurisdiction.
Hell, I don't know.  If I had some input I'd offer it up.
Did you say After Midnight?
Yeah, racy stuff, you know the kind, right?
Shopping here?
Yeah.  That's all I need, to become one of your in-laws.
About what?
Yeah...see you at three.
I don't know...
Look I worked all day, I'm tired as hell and I want to sit and eat in peace!  Is that asking too much?
Save me the sermon.  I've heard it all before, it's boring.
Listen -
We're gonna talk.
Yeah sure I'll grab something before I go...  Hey -- I've got a surprise.
And what happened?
Yeah.  Figured you could have it.
Well I don't know --
You assumed a brother coming in here can only afford five-hundred dollars a roll, is that right?  Are you a racist?
What??  Where'd you hear that?
I'd like to see you try.
I'm Lee's new muscle, his right arm -- and don't let the robe fool you.  This is the only color they had left.  Now get up!
Oh yes, she's very nice.
You play games with me, Detective, and you'll lose every time.  Don't forget. The odds are always in favor of the house.
That was my CD.  Don't you ever touch a Chinese man's CD.
No.
Are you kidding, they love me.  I'm a star, Lee.  A god to these people!
You just said you're their worst nightmare - and to line their mothers up for a milking.
That's Ricky Tan?  He's four feet tall. I'll go over with you right now, shake him down.
You're pathetic, man.  When's the last time you had some fun?  When's the last time you took a night off, had a date?
And you ain't black!
Why the hell should you believe him?  He had us beat up.  Naked.  That's nasty shit.
Ask me if I give a shit.
I know.  I know.  I am sorry.
Follow the RichWhiteMan...
The same place you find all RichWhiteMen.  Gefilte Fish.  Lox and bagel.  I love this stuff.  Here, try it with a smear.
The truth is, I haven't had any mu-shu in six months.
I'm sorry, Lee.  Why did she leave you?
I'm gonna go in the hall and get a bucket of ice.  You want some ice?
Snoopy is about six inches taller than you.  I'm sorry, Lee, you never had a chance.
She saved our lives.
For how long?  Face it, Lee, she's playing both sides.
We are not partners.  Between your daddy, my daddy, and the beating I just took, as far as I can tell all partners get you is dead.
I don't believe in reincarnation.  So I won't see you in the next world.
Fine by me.
No mu-shu.
What about a little king pao chicken?
That's rough, man.  If I don't get steamed dumplings once a week, I go crazy.
Who's Benjamin?
Follow me my Asian brother.
Yes.  We have lots of big men chasing us.
Dancing?  I'm out here trying to strong arm Steven Reign, putting my life on the line, and you're up here dancing with some bimbo.  Did she have a friend?
A little Mu-shu.
Just trying to make it look real.
Look over there.  That's the eye in the sky room.
How do I know I can trust you?
Now you know.
Don't.
Animals kill only from hunger or fear. The man you seek is lower than a serpent.  ...he kills for money.
Chief Inspector Lee will brief your people...
He was just doing his job.
So was I.
Okay, I'll slow down.  So we go downtown and we ask you a few questions... you know, like what's your name?  How old are you?  You ever expose yourself in public...shit like that.
You're shittin' me.  You know the Beach Boys?!
A little.
Bullshit a little.  You lied to me.
What?
Witnesses.
Wait. You hungry?  You gotta be hungry, you just flew in from China. And what'd they feed you, Chinese food, right?  Then you gotta be hungry.  Hell, it doesn't matter, I'm hungry.  We'll get some food on the way to the Consulate.
It was not my intent --
Hey, everybody fits in here. Look at L.A., man.  Nobody's from here.  My momma's from Detroit, my dad's from Atlanta, they met in Texas, got married in Vegas and I was born in Alabama.  So where the hell am I from? Kenya?
Good God, ya'll!
I'm sorry.
Well, I ain't goin' to China.  And neither are you.
Oh baby, don't worry, I'll call you. You can count on it.
What?! This is a class ride, Johnson.
Yeah, if you're Superfly.
We saved the girl and got the bad guys, didn't we?
You come highly recommended, Carter. And your particular assignment requires a special talent.
You think this is funny, Carter?  You send for someone from Explosives!? Four men just died in there!
Why don't you try the assignment.  Or should I call and ask for somebody who can handle it?
I'm not interested, Carter.  You're no longer on this assignment.
I wouldn't touch that if I were you.
Can I speak with her?
Carter, can I have a moment?
Don't be nervous, Maggie.  Let us visualize.  Remember what Bob said? "Be the ball."
So?  I never returned your calls, even when we were married.  And what's Fisher doing here anyway?
Journalism lesson number one.  If you fabricate your facts, you get fired.
That's not nothing to do with it.  You cooked this story up and you know it.
See?  You want custody of my job? ... Why not just consider my wrist slapped and call me when you feel I've served my time?
Poor Ike.
Since when does Ellie need moral supp--
This is good.  It is a good story, Fish.
This is about her negative attention, not mine.  Did you get the reimbursement for the dress yet?
No, I'm paying for the dress.  Do you think she's still gonna run?
Well, I'm writing another article on the cacophony.
That must have made you proud.
Oh, yeah.  Scared the hell out of Skipper.
You know, your daughter seems...
Ah, beautiful.  I just can't see her leaving multiple grooms in the dust like that.
Gotta tell you this about my daughter. My daughter makes real good time, even in a long dress and heels.  Maggie may not be Hale's longest running joke, but she certainly is the fastest.
Yes.
You have one?
You're going to be very disappointed.
We'll see.
Because I think you're writing on spec and with a first person interview, you might actually sell that thing.
Well, I'm impressed.  Absolutely incredible.  I didn't expect pink and lacy, but this isn't exactly a woman's room.
Maybe you should ask her some time. Ever thought of that?
Can you fix it?
I don't and I don't think you should...
That was very interesting research George was doing!
Brian told you that?
That's right.  You're so lost you don't even know how you like your eggs.
Yes I do!
And the church.
And the wedding date.  There's the two of us.  So, you think... maybe... You have to go down the aisle with somebody you love and who love you back.
Something that brings warmth to my heart.  Duckbill platypus.
It's only funny at Camp Birchwood at three in the morning at a tick hunt. It's not anymore.
See, this is a mature relationship. She's really found it.
You and your lucky geese.  You always see geese.
No.  It's my life.
What am I going to do with a microwave?
It sounds nice.
No, that's free.  He's an architect.  Used to do big high-profile projects.  He scaled it all back when his wife died.  Now he remodels people's homes.  He works in a small firm, makes a good living.
-- because Irene threatened to put the dog to sleep if he didn't --
Walter, I'd love to --
It's delicious, trust me.
Look!
I should say something in this about magic.
Do you think at the end of the movie when she's in the wheelchair they can still do it?
I love you, too.
I love that dream.
What about the letter?
I love the symphony.
No, no, no, it's more like, who is he, does he have a sense of humor, is he nice -- no forget nice, I've got nice --
A sense of humor.
He wasn't even wrong for you, like <u>cosmically</u> wrong, so don't beat up on yourself for wasting...however long it was.
Come on, Jonah --
What?
I know, I know.  I do not want to move to Seattle.  But what I really don't want to do is end up always wondering what might have happened and knowing I could have done something. What do you think?  It's just cold feet, isn't it? Everyone panics before they get married, didn't you?
I know.  He's wonderful, isn't he?
Magic.
The cabinets have to be redone --
Why me? What about Jay?
Who is this?
No.
Well, okay.  What's the big deal?  If she'll forget the new fireplace, I'll marry her. Just point me in the right direction.
You mean, like, "He has the cutest butt"? Where did I hear that recently?
It's Y. O. H.
Your only hope.
Nobody knows.  It changes practically every day.  How much money do you have?
Window.
What is it?
I don't think I have to now.
What?
You have to give them your phone number or they won't let you go on the air.
What do you think?
Will she scratch up your back?
Bye bye blackbird.
WAIT!!!  -- "and while we're on the subject, let's just say right now that Brooks Robinson was the best third baseman ever. It's important that you agree with me on that because I'm from Baltimore."  Dad, she thinks Brooks Robinson is the greatest.
Perfect.  We'll be there.
There she is.
I thought I saw a black widow spider.
If she knew, she'd never forgive me.  It would be hopeless for the two of you.
I sincerely hope you are not going to marry Jessica.
What's wrong with Annie?
Did too.
Goddammit, I am sick of this --
Listen, have I ever done anything really stupid?
Do you like it?
Well...
Now that I'm seeing someone, it's a whole other thing.
Look, I met somebody.  She's good, and capable and smart. We hit it off.  We can't spend your life chasing after fantasies.
You look good yourself.
I've already solved it.  I've hired a hit man.
No.  After he was born, every time we started to make love, he would cry.  He had an uncanny sense of timing.  We really shouldn't do anything here anyway.
He's good at it.
I read the same article...
You haven't tried locking them up!
You know ...  What's good for the goose is good for the gander.
He will if he wants us to go on blasting.
Now don't start talking against the union again.
NO, she wants to be there.  And there's Mrs. Kalinsky.
Sure.
We can't go on this way. I just can't go on living with you. Not this way.
And you know why? Because the company knows they can starve us out -- even if it takes another two, three months. What's it to them if the mine's shut down a little longer?
I don't know what you're talking about.
Look who's talking! The Great White Father, and World's Champion of Women's Rights.
Aw, cut it out, Ruth.
No. New York.
The Junior Shop Stewards. There's lots of ways we can help.
Don't I have enough troubles without them shipping you off to reform school?
Yeah? First door on the right. It ain't that dirty.  Just kinda' filthy is all.
Nothing, I'm trying to remember...
You like that?
Yeah.
Just make sure you come alone. This guy won't like any surprises
I understand. Thanks anyway.
Come on, cheer up. It could be worse.
That bad, huh?
Oh, he's a keeper all right.
Colette ...
Look, it's really none of my business but why don't you just dump this guy?
I can't.
Fuck you.
How?
It's the only way to play.
I try.
Yes. Why do you find that so hard to believe?
How much time do you have?
I just can't. Okay?
Nothing could be worse then this slow death I'm living now.
That's when he called me. He told me his story and he pitched me a plan.
Why's that?
Well, Jimmy the Finn, let's go score some gack.
Why does it have to feel so bad?
I think on account of his nose.
No. I'm good.
Sure, Jimmy.
I don't trust anybody.
Crank or glass?
Hey, I don't play that.
If it's all the same to you, I'd rather not dish right here in the middle of Crankville.
Bobby, rhymes with hobby.
Somebody has to help you lazy bastards.
Garcetti thinks everything is shit. He doesn't even like dolphins.
I can't help it, Tanner, you hit like a fucking girl.
No. You just handed us a new one.  We can go Federal on your ass right now: ongoing criminal conspiracy. Intent to buy and distribute $250,000 worth of crank.  What's the mandatory on that, Al?
The Mexicali Boys
Who the hell is Jimmy?
Lay off, Garcetti.  I'm not in the mood.
Why doesn't Palmdale P.D. just raid the guy?
I was talking about Miles.
Yeah, I'd hate to shoot you by accident.
I just want to be straight on the details.  Can I taste it?
Where are your men now?
Sir?
In the back of a nineteen and thirty- one stretch Hudson with a big ole' trailer.
The Army gave you that?
They got squirrels there, too, right?
You shut up, this is the most fucked up mission I ever heard of.  Goddamned Ryan, fuck the little bastard.
Reiben, are you makin' fun 'a the way I talk?
Hell, no!
Like hell, you did.
Jackson, how many times I got to tell you, you're from Tennessee.
You'll grieve the way I tell you to goddamned grieve.  There is no Wade, there was one, but he died a long time ago, he's been dead for so long you can hardly remember his name, you understand?
A half-track, anything.
Senator's son?
The men said, nine.
You don't count.
I changed my mind.
I THOUGHT YOU WERE MY MOTHER.
You?  Leading a squad?
I've got a line on one.
Uh, Captain...
It's not normal, not reading letters from home.
Good news?
They're fine.  As long as they can gripe, they'll be alright.
Command isn't going to let them withdraw and the Germans sure as hell aren't going to let them surrender.
You never know.
Rolls to his feet.  FIRE another BURST.  KILLS the last of the German riflemen.  Doesn't pause.  RUNS onto the field.
Let's just find someplace.
Yeah, Vecchio, I couldn't remember his name, he was a good kid, remember how he used to walk on his hands and sing that song about the man on flying trapeze?
She's the best poker player you ever saw.  My father used to go to these Saturday night games and lose his shirt.  Finally, my mother gave him an ultimatum, either she gets a regular seat at the table or she locks him in every Saturday night. He squawked and so did his buddies but after a while they gave in and from the first night she sat down, she never lost.  She could read those cocky bastards like they were playing open hands.  And he bluffs?  He had sixteen levels of bullshit.  Her eyes, the tone of her voice, her bets, her jokes, the way she sipped her coffee, she was a master.  She won more money on shit hands than anyone in the history of the game. Every Saturday night, my father would lose two, three hundred bucks and she'd win it all back and then some. And I'd stand there, glued to her shoulder, from the time I was five years old, watching every hand, every move, studying how she did it.  That's why I'm such a good officer, I can look at a man's face and tell you exactly what he's holding, and if it's a shit hand, I know just what cards to deal him.
Not in so many words, but they tell you you can have all the firepower in the world and if your men don't have good morale, it's not worth a damn.  So if you're scared or empty or half-a-step from a Section Eight, do you tell your men?  Of course not.  You bluff, you lie.
Yes, sir.
Please, sir, you can't take me to Ramelle, I gotta go to Caen, sir, please, I told you, they make Caen lingerie there, it's beautiful, it's the best there is, it's...oh, please, sir...
Trust me, you're the best.
Well, sir, in purely arithmetic terms, since when does six equal one?  What's the sense in risking six guys to save one?
Reiben, there's a fairly good chance you're not going to die at all.
You have orders, too.
I'm sorry, sir, I apologize.  But if you weren't a captain, or if I were a major, what would you say?
Well now I'm saying we're moving out.  Get off your ass.
B:  Ryan is dead.  He's been blown up by the German equivalent of Wade, whose name I know you don't want me to mention.  There's nothing to find. The biggest piece is the size of a pea.  We wander around, looking for him until the Germans pick us off, one after another.
What if our guys open up, sir?
That's not where I am.  Miller No? Where are you?
Knows what that means.  He hears the RUMBLE OF THE TANKS.
No, private, I want you to stay here, keep your head down, don't do anything brave or stupid.
Sarge?  He was the best friend I ever had.  Lemme tell you about Sarge...
Out of the frying pan, into the fucking latrine.
I care.  Don't you know what Caen's famous for, Sarge?
Get lost.
Goddamn it...Goddamn it...Goddamn it...
Freaked out.  Trying to keep his eyes on the perimeter.  Can't.
Since I was nine years old.  They got a lot of explosives around mines. Me and my little brother could get into any warehouse you ever saw. Damn, we had fun!
You're trying to get me to say something, that's why you're telling me all of this.
And your former wife.
What family?  We never heard from them.  I sold her house for them, made them money.
Why would you stay so long with an operation that is so clearly not a growth enterprise?
For going to school?
Yeah, I don't want it.  Um, thank you very much.  You're very kind.
I still am.
I just washed this shirt, didn't I?
Yes I did- I sat across from her in a mall.  We ate together.  We ate, that's eating, sharing an important physical event.
Do me a favor; take a picture of me with her.
See you tomorrow.
I'm sorry.  It's just you're a really nice guy, and we don't want to see you get hurt.
Look at his face, he did the deed.
I can accept that.
Oh yeah!
I didn't think anyone would get it.
Okay.
You won it.  You're going to study at the finest institute at England, the toughest fellowship in the country, and you won.
Well, I don't think he's really been embarrassed by it.
Dad.
Dad, yes.  And I'm scared to death of what you must think of me right now.
But I found the money.
No, you don't know what it is.  It's not for me.  This money's for you, for when you come back from England with honors to set you up, so you don't have to depend on anybody again.  Diane, I take better care of these people than their families do.  I care for them, I give them flowers, I feed them, I wipe their mouths...
I trusted you.  I stood up in court five years ago and I picked you.
Okay.  Oh, here's Ray.  Just talk to him because when you don't, your mouth turns down.
Yeah, yeah, yeah.  You remember?
No tips.  I won't give you any tips of any kind.
They're Bavarian Death style  pretzels.
It's the worst job since keymaster.
Basic.  Hmmm.
So what's your job this summer?
Mmmm.
Won't you see me later?
Me?  Sure I do.
Okay.
Yeah.  With potential.
Yeah.
Right.
Yeah.
Well no, it's not noble, but it's a good aid to your lesson.
I've never sent a letter like that, you know?  I mean, I felt like I wanted to tell you something, but I didn't put it in the letter, and I didn't say it, but I want to say it now, I'm not sure if I should say it, you know, 'cause people always say it and don't mean it, but I think that I mean it, so, um, I just wanted to tell you...
Yeah.
We decided...
It sounded like you did.
Then don't do it.
I'm sorry.
Alright, personalised flight care from Corey.  Books, cassettes, magazines, anything?
I know.
He's back.  Hey my brother, can I borrow a copy of your 'Hey Soul Classics'?
No my brother, you have to go buy your own.
Uh... okay... um...
Uh, no, not really, no actually, basically, you don't know me. I'm a friend of your daughters; well I sat with her yesterday at the mall.
Hello.  Heard about that graduation present.  Really quite a car. Look, I know you're busy, you don't' have to retain me, but you can trust me.  I'll tell you a couple of things about myself, I'm nineteen, been overseas for a couple of semesters, but now I'm back.  I'm an athlete, so I rarely drink.  Kickboxing.  You heard of kickboxing, sport of the future?  Don 'The Dragon' Wilson, Lenny [?] merciless, one of the champions of the sport?  I can see by your face, no.  My point is, you can relax because your daughter will be safe with me for the next seven to eight hours.
Are you?
I know
Very talented.
Stop freaking with her head man.  Just stop playing with her mind, you know?  She's a human being.  She's a person.  She's very talented, you know.
What?
I'm Lloyd Dobler.
You know Diane Court?
Alright!
I love you man.
Sir, the list is correct.
It's up to you.
Breslau?  I can't go to Breslau.  Not now.
I'd say I'd get you one but the guy who made it, he's probably dead, I don't know.
Some of the boys went crazy, what're you going to do?  You're right, it's bad business, but it's over with, it's done.  Occasionally, sure, okay, you got to make an example.  But that's good business.
What do you want for him, I'll give it to you.
You're not telling me something.
You did, but you didn't.
You don't recognize it?  Maybe that's because it's not what I asked for.
My buyers sold it to a guy who sold it to the Army.  But by the time it got there - because of the cold - it broke, the whole truckload.
How should I know?  It's broken. See what you can do.
Are you losing money?
I lost a day of production.  I lost a worker.  I expect to be compensated.
He was a metal press operator, quite skilled.
We're aware of that.
37 usages of Himbry  located in the registar's office. 9 Tatum's, 47 Riley's. And that's just on campus. It's hopeless.
Broad daylight, a crowded movie theatre. This is too much fun for one person.
thought he was doing AA.
Stop it...
That's okay.
I'm designated driver. I have to be here in case a sister calls and needs a ride.
I'm impatient. Look, do you wanna leave a message for someone?
No, it's me.
Can we talk?
How? What could I say that would make a difference? I took away a year of your life--how do I apologize for that?
It helped me realize one thing.
What?
But youll never get away with it.
Where's Sid?
I'm sorry honey. I got behind.
I'll get my jacket.
It's not you, Derek. I don't trust myself. I tend to make big selection errors when it comes to men.
Aren't most serial killers seemingly harmless?
I find his work overwrought.
Youd me amazed at how many of us there are out there. Its a whole world, Sid. Youre really popular amongst the demented.
The way I see it. Well be arrested. Go to prison. Cash in on the home footage. Secure a book deal. If all goes as planned, our trial should coincide with the release of STAB II.
Yeah, we really had our work cut out for us. It really is the curse of the sequel. The Billy/Stu things been done.
Page 32. "Deputy Dewey filled the room with his dim-witted Barney Fifish presence." I think you've explained yourself.
I never meant to imply...
And deep down I'm a good person? Make no mistake, Dewey, I'm a shit.
C'mon. Let's go.
Yeah, well...you are the definition of mixed emotions. I really should hate you... I see your movie's getting good reviews.
It's hell week. I'm pledging the Deltas.
But who would operate your camera?
Nah...I think it'll die off. It's opening weekend. Let's see how it goes.
Everyone in the theater is SCREAMING. Maureen tries her best to detach herself from the movie. She eats her popcorn.
The young girl is slashed again.
Gale?
I'm sorry, I'm sorry but I had to. It was too easy.
Do you work for her now?
Me, too. Randy. Me too.
I'll relay it. You sure you don't wanna go home?
Do I?
I swear to God if you lay a finger on her I'll fucking kill you!
Maybe so, but right now, we play the game. First question, Your girlfriend's counting on you, Name your girlfriend's character in STAB 2?
Very good. Now we play ROUND 2.
That's right. And you beat ROUND 1. Now we're taking the game to a whole new level.  Meet me beneath the Hollywood sign in ten minutes. I'll have your girlfriend. We'll be waiting.
To see your reaction.
Yes well we have a suspect, so don't get that worried.
Ben Damon. Christine Perkins. Sarah Darling. Tom Prinze. That's four, last time I learned how to count.
Wrong, this issue is Sidney Prescott!  And either Mr. Riley is going to obstruct justice or is going to put me in touch with her.  So, where is she?
Hmm.
He could've monitored the calls on a scanner. Did you call her from the set?
I figured I'd be safe If I was at least up here with the people I care about.  Now where's this Kincaid guy the news is talking about? I found this place from a FOX 5 TV NEWS REPORT. Heh.
Don't worry Sid I'd never leave you like that.
This has everything to do with me Dewey. I was the one who brought the nation's attention to this shit anyway. I'll be damned if I'm gonna sit around and pass on the buck again.
So it's off to London for a week?  New York for a month? L.A Forever?
Dewey, you're not just here because of that second rate K-Mart, straight-to-video version of me, are you?
Always.
Gale, your engine's still running.
I work better alone.  Why don't you do some snooping around the set?
Nevermind, what'd you two find?
God damn you Gale Weathers! Don't you see? The killer is choosing  his victims as they die in the script! Ben Damon's character was the first one to get offed. So was his girlfriend - but she wasn't cast yet so his real girlfriend was killed - then Sarah Darling's Candy, and now me!
No! He's not dead! He's still breathing! Look!
You know in the movies, I play you as being much smarter.
And as a sane person.  For you that must be quite a stretch.
Really, you know you'd make a fascinating interview. Lifestyles of the Rich and Psychotic.
Are you saying she was-
Hey I really liked that piece you did on me last month. The one where you said my car accident was caused by me drinking and drugs, and how I faked the tire blow-out just so my insurance wouldn't sky rocket.
I know!
I can't take it anymore. This Hollywood exploitation of the nightmare I lived has to be stopped. I did this to make you all repent for your sins, and now I'm pleased I've got my message across. Good-bye.
Hello.
Who's this?
It's Sarah.
Roman that's not the line.
Great. A spirited one. I'll be seeing you real soon Sidney. Real soon.
Yes.
Go there.
Piece of cake. She'll be there.
And if you get it right -- you die.
I'll only stay a sec.
What are you doing here?
See, it couldn't have been me. I was in jail, remember?
But this is life. This isn't a movie.
What?
Got the ending figured out yet? Time's running out.
I'm sorry. I guess I dialed the wrong number.
Why don't you want to talk to me?
I don't think so.
Uh-huh.
Uh-huh.
Is that the one where the guy had knives for fingers?
The first one was, but the rest sucked.
What do you think I said?
Don't hang up on me.
They'd never make it in time.
I swear it. And he's big and plays football and will beat the shit out of you.
Go to the back door and turn on the porch light -- again.
Then you should know Jason's MOTHER -- Mrs. Vorhees was the original killer. Jason didn't show up until the sequel.
Answer the question and I will.
And my Dad? Any word on him?
She's tough.
Jesus! The camera-hurry!
If I'm gonna blow this up -- I need hard proof.
As long as it records I don't give a shit. We're not doing a remote.
Yes, that's right.
It'll be out later this year.
Do you still think he's innocent?
Have you talked to Cotton?
Not one word. He admits to having sex with your mother but that's all.
Because they're all the same. It's always some stupid killer stalking some big breasted girl -- who can't act -- who always runs up the stairs when she should be going out the front door. They're ridiculous.
Maybe that's because I'm not Randy.
So who are you?
Your front porch.
Oooooh... before or after he sliced and diced.
Listen to me, Sid. I found Tatum. She's dead, she's been killed... I think Stu did it.
What are you saying? That I killed her or something?
I'm gonna gut your ass in a second.
There's always some stupid bullshit reason to kill your girlfriend. That's the beauty of it all. Simplicity. Besides, if it's too complicated you lose your target audience.
There goes my chance with Sid.
Don't listen to him. It's him. He's the one.
Yeah, yeah... are you okay?
Good, 'cause I wanna swing by BLOCKBUSTER and get us a video. I was thinkin' Tom Cruise in ALL THE RIGHT MOVES. You know, if you pause it just right you can see his penis.
Her dad's out of town. She's staying with us.
No, nothing's like it used to be.
He was there, Tatum.
Come on, let's rock.
Oh, god...
You have a few intimacy issues as a result of your mother's untimely death. It's no big deal. You'll thaw out.
Billy and his penis don't deserve you.
How does that get you in the mood with Stu?
That is so sexist. The killer could easily be female -- BASIC INSTINCT.
How's that?
Ease back, Mills.
I'm in.
I thought you might want to be filled in.
I can breathe withour pain now, so I guess I feel great.
It's going to be flawless.  People will barely be able to comprehend it.  It will seem almost surreal... but it will have a tangible reality, so they won't be able to deny it.
A woman... so ugly on the inside that she couldn't bare to go on living if she couldn't be beautiful on the outside.  A drug dealer... a drug dealing pederast, actually.  And, don't forget the disease spreading whore.  Only in a world this shitty could you even try to say these were innocent people and keep a straight face.  That's the point.  You see a deadly sin on almost every street corner, and in every home, literally.  And we tolerate it. Because it's common, it seems trivial, and we tolerate, all day long, morning, noon and night.  Not anymore.  I'm setting the example, and it's going to be puzzled over and studied and followed, from now on.
Maybe I'm not understanding the question.
What?
I'm invited to have a late supper at your house.  And, I accept.
I just have to say, I can't respect any man who's never seen "Green Acres."
He cut along the side of his stomach.  The love handle.
Right.  But there, pride comes first, not gluttony.  The sins are in a different order.
Like, because someone's holding a gun on you.
I know.
Doesn't seem like our man, does it?
Satisfy our curiosity?
No kidding!  No fucking kidding!
Sooner or later his luck's goning to run out.
No.  He's not depending on luck.  You've seen that.  We walked into that apartment exactly one year after he first tied Victor to the bed, to the day.  To the day! Because he wanted us to.
Yes we do.  Here...
Well, he's been right so far, hasn't he?
Just, realize... this is not some common lunatic.  The type of intestinal fortitude it must take... to keep a man bound for a full year.  To connect tubes to his genitals.  To sever his hand and use it to plant fingerprints.  He's methodical and exacting, and worst of all, he's patient.
Let's go.
It's not what you think it is.
Okay... okay... get off.
If we get him, I'll be happy enough.
Where's the victory?
I can tell you this.  I recognize his lawyer.  His name's Mark Swarr.
I will.
Kiss me on the lips.
I... I don't understand.
I don't know why... why now?
Why don't you finish the job?
AND other things...Mebbe you thought you was gettin' away with being comical about that Indian wife you took...I bet she wasn't the first squaw you...
Well, that's seven we can score up to your brother, Ethan.
In that case, give the boys room...
I'm askin' as a Ranger of the sovereign state of Texas.
Yes, sir...But if you're wrong, <U>Captain</U> Clayton, don't ever give me another!
This an invite to a necktie party, Reverend?
How many, would you say?
Well you found me...Good work, son...Good work.
These are my people...  Unnt-meah! Go! Go! <U>Please</U>!
You help me find her, you got your rockin' chair...
Keefer!..Put this man under arrest!
Name's Ethan...Now what's so mighty fishy about this trail?
Well, fust off...
Sorry...We don't even know if Debbie 'n Lucy are with this bunch...Maybe they split up...
No...our turnin' back don't change anything...not in the long run. If she's alive, she's safe...for a while...They'll keep her to raise as one of their own, 'til she's of an age to...
She's been with the bucks! She's nothin' now but a...
There's one thing. We recovered a bushel of trinkets in that camp... cheap stuff...trade goods...Couldn't help noticing that most of it was Mexican...Maybe if you could talk to some of those Mexican traders along the border...What do they call themselves?
Yes!..Yes, I remember!..Have they found her, Ethan?
You've seen her!...She's alive?
I gotta catch up with him, Laurie!
No, it wasn't...You mighta said you loved me...You mighta asked me to wait...At least that'd have been something...
Oh God, Tommi...
We just have to make a new beginning.
This house, the whole damned area around here is one mass grave... Now you might call me crazy, but there is something negative about the place.
Martin, damnit, what are you up to? Let go of me!
It's a pleasure.  You're from the city, right?
Well, it will never leave us alone as long as you ignore it.
Very funny.
I guess someone lost their key. You did get your tetanus shots, I hope?
The speech is excellent.  "Oh, then I see Queen Mab hath been with you!" Excellent and a good length. But then he disappears for the length of a bible.
He was the first man among us. A great light has gone out.
I gave Shakespeare two sovereigns for Romeo!
What is the chief part?
Aye, now and again, but what of it? I have lost my gift.
Who is that?
And buys a deadly poison. He enters the tomb to say farewell to Juliet who lies there cold as death. He drinks the poison. He dies by her side. And then she wakes and sees him dead.
A new comedy. By Will Shakespeare!
What have I done, Mr. Fennyman?
The theatres are all closed by the plague!
So what do we do?
Every word.
She is always Aphrodite.
We are about to embark on a great voyage.
It is customary to make a little speech on the first day. It does no harm and authors like it.
What do we do now?
What is the story?
His best friend is killed in a duel by Ethel's brother or something. His name is Mercutio.
"Of love?"
Lady Viola is pious, my lord.
All the men at court are without poetry. If they look at me they see my father's fortune. I will have poetry in my life. And adventure. And love. Love above all.
No . . . not the artful postures of love, but love that over- throws life. Unbiddable, ungovernable, like a riot in the heart, and nothing to be done, come ruin or rapture. Love like there has never been in a play.  I will have love or I will end my days as a . . .
My lady, this play will end badly. I will tell.
I love theatre. To have stories acted for me by a company of fellows is indeed
There was a wager, I rememberas to whether a play can show the very truth and nature of love. I think you lost it today.  You are an eager boy. Did you like the play?
By and by I come to cease thy strife and leave me to my grief. A thousand times good night!"
Are you to be my muse, ROSALINE?
Burbage has my keeping but you have my heart.
But your voice  Have they dropped?
"The exchange of thy love's faithful vow for mine."
And that was only my first try.
It is broad day!  The rooster tells us so!
My love is no lie. I have a wife, yes, and I cannot marry the daughter of Sir Robert de Lesseps. It needed no wife come from Stratford to tell you that. And yet you let me come to your bed.
Oh, my love  You ran from me before.
"It was the lark, the herald of the morn, No nightingale. Look, love, what envious streaks Do lace the severing clouds in yonder east. Night's candles are burnt out, and jocund day Stands tiptoe on the misty mountain tops. I must be gone and live, or stay and die."
If my hurt is to be that you will write no more, then I shall be the sorrier.
Sold in marriage and half way to America.
and thus unable to declare her love
Write me well.
My lord.
Bless me, I thought it was a horse.
I am going to church.
My hat?
No, sir.
Yes, like rain and sun, like cold and heat.  Is your lady beautiful? Since I came to visit from the country, I have not seen her close. Tell me, is she beautiful?
Marlowe? Oh yes, he is the one, lovely waistcoat, shame about the poetry.
About what?
I'm only asking what you think.
Think about it.
No.
It's asick idea, Alex. It's sick.
Do I? What? What? What are you talking about?
We all are, David, we're all going to do it. Each of us, you, me and Juliet, will do his or her bit. Is that fair enough?
I can't do it.
I won't be able to.
How much?
You're not eating.
What for? What did you want? The money? Was that it?
It doesn't neccessarily matter. They don't even know who those people are, and even if they did, they have nothing to connect them with us, nothing at all.
Where do you think you'll go?
But there's no --
It looks like he's writing everything down.
No. Why should it?
Parked outside?
Yes.
Now, let me get this straight. This affair that you're not having, is it not with a man or not with a woman?
OK, so A has left you, B is ambivalent, you're still seeing C but D is the one you yearn for. What are we to make of this? If I were you, I'd ditch the lot. There's a lot more letters in the alphabet of love.
For my life? At a discussion group? I think not.
Alex.
It was you, Juliet, it was you --
A miserable, burnt-out, empty shell of a -- Alex pauses, looks at his drink, then at Juliet.
Know and love?
Yeah.
David?
His car's still there.
So what's wrong with that?
A blue one, OK. And it's still there.
So?
Did what?
I don't want to. It's different.
Don't know. No one said anything. ALEX Rendered speechless with desire. I recall that feeling, from the days when I had such a thing.
I don't want it to taste different. I don't know why I bother. Is that enough for you? Hey!
He can't stay up there.
He'll come down. Leave him alone.
We have to talk.
He won't do anything for me, but for you --
Everything.
The perfect couple, I should say.
What?
It's about the burglary.
Who said there were four?
Yes, absolutely.
Yes. Why do you think you woke and they didn't?
I don't know. Maybe I'm a light sleeper.
Yeah, that's right, that's it.
Yes.
It's alright. I think he got the message anyway.
Two hundred pounds.
No one. I promise.
You and me?
What?
Well, it's a wide range of, eh --
That guy, the one that died.
Oh, him. Well, he died.
I see.
Yes, the telephone, but if it's for me, I'm not in. HUGO You're not in.
Did he sound upset?
Yes, the first one's fine. Heathrow direct.
Look, would you argue with your doctor?
Why would I like to know if there's nothing I can do about it, goddammit --
-- cause she's going to be very, very expensive.
Lester, you're a miserable man. You're not helping anybody. You're just twisting arms to raise money for a lot of silly son of a bitches that are out for themselves -- this is just business, don't kid yourself. And you know the worst thing about it, even if it does somebody some good somewhere which I can't possibly imagine, you'll never know the difference. You're just sweating and kidding yourself - and you're kidding yourself if you think your new business partner is going to keep his hands off that girl -- or that she'll keep her hands off him.
I'll be back in a while.
-- to be put in that kind of position...
What're you doing later?
I know.
Right now, I just don't care.
I don't know, kill herself. She's O.D.'d four times.
It isn't?
I guess so.
Chopped liver?
No thanks.
Well, are you? Are you queer?
I asked you first.
In fact, I don't think I've ever been to a beauty parlor in my whole life.
You are.
You are today.
Jill's really great, isn't she?
Oh, about six weeks now... Lester -- well, he's very sweet.
No, thanks.
Well, I do.
Jackie, would you argue with your doctor.
I won't screw you up.
You know what I'm talking about.
I know... you don't know, I know.
What are you talking about?
-- what guy?
-- yes, you --
-- well you better go after her.
Well then what are you trying to do-
I want to marry you. I want to take care of you and I want your children, and I want you to be my girl. That's all I want. That's all I want out of my life, and it's a lot.
So I'm saying it...
What's that supposed to mean?
What?
I've got to... I've got to tell him where I am.
Oh yeah?
You were supposed to handle that bitch, she's always asking for you, and she was furious you weren't here.
Don't talk like a child. You're a pro, now get out there and cut!
-- Oh my yes.
That's too bad.
I'm gonna open the shop, baby, I'm gonna open the shop. I'm getting it together.
Honey, what happened?
Not right now, I don't mean right now... but eventually...
Great.
Could I?
Great... can we talk later?
Hey, baby, say hello to Felicia.
No, but I think they might.
I want your feelings about it.
A friend dropped me off.
I have to have Jackie ask me? Don't you think you could call me and let me know? Look at my hair.
I didn't want him meeting me here.
I'd like you to leave now.
Who knows, I'm sure you don't -- but if it'll help any, I found it in your bed.
Baby, don't do this. I do love you.
I just want to know while we were seeing each other... I just don't want girls looking at me and knowing and me not knowing...
Does it make you happy?
-- yes.
Did you?
Yes, yes, I did.
What did you say?
Thank you.
In a way. But...
I'm better than the guy I work for.
But personal services are not the kind of thing I usually get into.
They're not?
What about, tonight?
I don't know what to...
Layered?
Well yeah, otherwise it just sort, you know, lies there -- layer so it kind of fluffs out --
Sit down.
Did they have something against me?
No, man, no. You can say everybody's a whore. She's okay. I mean Jackie'll fuck around but not that much. Somewhere she really likes you, Lester, and it's not just the bread. She's okay.
All right, who're you with? Jill?
No.
Okay, okay...
I'm coming over.
Okay.
A daytime soap opera.
And?
What was it, somebody's daughter?
Steve?
Whatever his name is, that actor.
So I can't talk to some broken down actor, what do you think, I'm going to tell him I'm screwing Lester Karpf!
Because I don't want one.
Jill Haynes, Jill Haynes, I've told you about Jill a hundred times, Lester, you never remember anything I say.
I'm not. Maybe I am.
No, listen. He's a very good hairdresser.
Nothing.
But you have problems?
Honey?
-- I was in the kitchen doing the dishes and George was out in Long Beach doing a show...
Now I'm embarrassed to tell you.
Johnny!
Not with your hairdresser.
-- oh I don't know --
Those Arabs won't be when they start chasing you around the sand dunes.
Oh that's no problem.  -- take care of this boy's problem, will you, Gene?
-- there's not much room --
No.
Do you feel bad?
Do you like this hotel?
What do you mean?
Nothing.  There ain't nothing in Room 237, but you ain't got no business going in there anyway, so stay out!  You understand, stay out!
Okay.  You behave yourself.
Yes?
Can I go to my room and get my fire-engine?
I won't make any noise.
Red Rum.  Red Rum.
Red Rum.
Oh!
Did Tony's first appearance happen to coincide with your arrival here?
Well how can I repay you?
Advocaat is it?
Fine.
There's nothing I look forward to with the greater pleasure, Mr. Grady.
All right, sir.
Oh Wendy.  That's nice.  That's the prettiest.
Well one thing for sure, you don't have to worry about food because you folks could eat up here a whole year and never have the same menu twice.
Pleased to meet you.
Things could be better, Lloyd. Things could be a whole lot better.
Women!  Can't live with 'em.  Can't live without 'em!
God, I've never seen anything like this before.  Are all of these Indian designs authentic?
Which room was it?
I think he did it to himself.
You mean just leave the hotel?
Wendy give me the bat.
Stay... stay away!
Give me the bat.
Stop swinging the bat.
Go away from me.
Nice to meet you, Mr. Ullman.
Do you mind if I ask why you do that?  It seems to me that the skiing up here would be fantastic.
Well, that sounds fine to me.
Well, that is eh quite a story.
Oh fine.  Well in view of all the ground that we to cover today, I suggest we go and have a quick look at your apartment and then get started straight away.
Uncle Al-
Come on, Jane- it was Brady's idea. I couldn't stop him.
All except my legs... I don't think I can walk.
Rattling. Rustling.
And my dad says it's kids. But it's not rats and it's not kids. It's-
Let the boy finish the game, Nan.
What?
It goes fast, all right- and if your mother finds out just how fast, Marty, I will have a new job. Singing soprano with the Vienna Boys' Choir.
I know you don't. But I want this to be our secret. You get that, don't you?
I didn't shoot him when he was a man. I shot him when he was-
I told you!
I think he's going to come for me. Not just because I know who he is, but because I hurt him. Only I don't think he'll try again as Lowe.
Yeah, you learned a whole lot, I can tell.
LET THY SOUL BE HEALED
Were you tempted?
SING!
We were talking about the wild thing. Teen promiscuity.
Probation?
You know it.
You ain't got nothin' I ain't seen.
Then stop trying to memorize it.  Hit the road.
We can still see each other.  Just like always.  It's a different kind of sin. Smaller.
Thanks.  A lot.
Good evening, Vincent.
What, Vincent?  This is me, doll.  I know you.  What did you think you were doing?  Running to the cops.  Hiding out. No, no.  You're sorry now, aren't you?
Am I?
DAMNATION WAS ALL I COULD SEE
Enough jabber.
Like this place?
Whatever.
Free-lance?  Oh really?  You think I don't see?  You think I took vows yesterday?  I know what you're up to. You and Reverend Mother.
What?
Mary Robert.
A bunch of real mama's girls.
What?
Right, sure, but what's the problem? Are they keeping you a prisoner here? Do they drug you?  Did Reverend Mother like, kidnap your parents?  We can call the Enquirer.
Right.
Really?
Experience!
We could have been killed!  But you saved me!  Thank you, Mary Clarence!
Give me a C.  A C!
They're from my old convent.
BUT THE LORD CAME TO ME
What did He say?
What is your full name?  Your Christian name?
The reason?
I joined this convent some thirty years ago.  At that time, the world knew some measure of peace.  And hope.  Our order was a beacon of hospitality, to families, to children, to a neighborhood filled with promise.  And, as the years have passed, I have watched that promise destroyed.  Drugs.  Gangs.  Spandex.  And. so I have made this convent an oasis, a retreat from horror. And now that horror has invaded these sacred walls.
Of course.  But it's almost lunch.
Would you like that?
The vow of obedience.
A what?
A fast.  To remind us of the poor, of those who must endure without enough to eat.
It's like the Stone Age.  The room time forgot.  What about a phone?
Your cell is more than adequate.
Have you been out in those streets?  Do you know what those kids are up against? You should help them!
What?
Hold on.  That's not fair.  I worked hard with them.  They gave up their free time, and they loved it.  Those women are happy.  And we can get even better.  We can wake this place up.
You have a phone call.
What?
But -- why?
Good day.
At least he's not a cop.  At least he can afford a decent gift.
All right!  I get the picture!  I'll do it!  I'll testify!
Get a stenographer.
It's a convent.  All you have to do is shut up, behave yourself, and get along.
I can't stay here!  I'll crack up! Eddie, what am I gonna do?
You blew it -- big time.  She doesn't want you back.
Listen to yourself.  This isn't a career opportunity.
Me too.
That's not the point!  They need me!
It's a bluff, Vince.
You know so much.  They've got Christy, and we've got to find her.  Get her 8x10, from in front of the lounge.  Fax it to every contact we got.
Not... totally.
It didn't happen.
It didn't work, Vince.
So, take it off.
Where is she?
She's a broad!  Got it!  Just some broad!
No smart-ass remarks or nothing.
That's what I figured, too.
Dress rehearsal at four, performance at 8:30.  Sharp.
Reverend Mother, on behalf of the sisters, I'd like to welcome Mary Clarence to St. Katherine's.
It's no use.  She just isn't here.
Yes -- two men -- and they had guns.
But... she was a showgirl.  She didn't have an old convent.
But where?
We can save this young woman's life, and imprison a parasite -- all in one gesture.
And you'll face that danger head-on.  As if I could stop you.  And you have my complete support in this matter. Anything you can do to revitalize this neighborhood would be a blessing.
Are you nuts?  She's not a nun.  It's Christy.  She's a babe!
Must have been the Redman.  A Lenape Indian lives in the Western Woods.
Excuse me, Miss...  They have a laugh at your expense.
What of it?
The heads were not found severed. The heads were not found at all.
It is only important what you are. An adulterer...
Wallowing quite literally in blood.
You cannot do this.  I am a man of God!
Yes, sir... but, do you have these?
He drowned.  Anyone could see.
Why would he flee this direction, with so much open ground to cross before he reached cover?
He would not have gone into the Western Woods.  No sane man would.
No, you listen!  You may think we are a pack of superstitious dullards...
We must discover it.  The reason the murderer chose these persons.
Stay back.
All I saw was their lantern.
Business, best hidden is hidden best at night.
I cannot.  You should not worry.  Van Ripper and his wife will look after you.  They will.  You will be well cared for.
My suitor?
Which may explain his temperament. To have asked twice means the answer was "no" at least once.
There is no such thing as magic.
Yes, but listen.  The illusion is easily explained.  The eye retains each image, till they combine.  And yet, some would call this toy magic.
No stone may be left unturned.  It may appear harsh...
You are not regarding it in full. The Widow Windsor had been run through by a sword.  I followed the bloodless wound, a wound whose path I could not comprehend till I had seen the Horseman with my own eyes.
The child she carried was eight months grown at least... near to birthing.  The sword had pierced its tiny heart exactly.
If it had been surgery on a living person, done to save that person's life, you would not question it.  Not for a moment.  So, let me be the first to tell you, dear girl... on the other side of these sheltering mountains, a whole world has advanced beyond such plebeian thinking as yours.  And someday, no matter how much you fear it, that world will come to roust Sleepy Hollow out of its slumber.
What troubles you?
Just... keep where you are.
The skull is gone.
Yes.  I did notice that, thank you.
If you think I am behind this, say it.
Keep climbing.  I will follow...
No.  Get to the crest of the roof and be ready to jump.
She has taken the last of our grain to be milled.  You do have a background in the medical arts, don't you, Constable?
I didn't see none.
Sit.
You want to see into the nether world... I can show you.  Whatever you see, do not move or speak.  I will hold him.
No.
Yeah, that's a goodun. I believe you did tell me that one before. I've heard that a bunch. Long time ago.
Well, yeah it's a classic. You know, Karl, I got to thinkin' about it last night and it's just not Christian of me to not let you have a key. I mean you been in lockup so long, you don't need me keepin' you locked up. You need to come and go as you please. Here, take this key, it'll get you in and out that back door.  Them french fries good?
Well, he's pretty quiet. Except for them rackets and breathin' things he does. Ain't threatened me with a killin' or anything.  But boy you couldn't of been more right about him fixin' things. That son of a bitch is a regular Eli Whitney on a lawnmower. Loves french fries. Eats four larges and don't even so much as belch. I'm proud to have him.
What you got that's good to eat?
Yeah.
About a half a mile I think it is.
They was a boy. We made friends.
Catch you later Freddy!
He's just mentally retarded, I guess.
He does make some funny noises.
No Doyle. Vaughan don't want to come to a party with you.
Leave.
He's real honest. He wouldn't steal nothin'.
No sir's right. I'm talkin' to your mama. This is your mama's decision, not yours. I'm lettin' it go on because she asked me, not you.  Now is this the kind of retard that drools and rubs shit in his hair and all that, 'cause I have trouble eatin' around that kind of thing. Just like I am about antique furniture and midgets. I can't so much as drink a glass of water around a midget or a piece of antique furniture. Same thing with a droolin' retard.
I get nervous, that's all I know.
Oh, yeah, I'm thrilled.
Ain't got nowhere to set 'em down.
I reckon I feel all right.
Yeah it is. Your name's Frank.
I've had a lot of bad thoughts since my daddy died. Sometimes I wish I was still real little and he was still here. My mama's real good, but I wish I had both of 'em.  When we went to Memphis one time in the car, it was rainin' so hard we couldn't see the road. But I wadn't scared because I thought as long as daddy was drivin' nothin' could happen to us. I feel that way about mama now.  Mama has a boyfriend now. His name is Doyle Hargraves. He works construction so he makes a pretty good livin'. He still don't help mama out with any money though. He ain't no good. He's mean to her. He don't like me at all. Mama says it's because he's jealous I belong to my daddy instead of him. He stays with us all night sometimes, but he's got his own house. Somebody told me it's so he can still have other girlfriends. I like it on the nights when he ain't at our house. I'm not so nervous then.
I don't see how you can eat that stuff with all those insides it's made out of.
Where'd you get them flowers?
Yeah, me too.  That was nice of that woman to give you them flowers.
I ain't got no money to get 'em with but I bet Vaughan will let me have some of them flowers at the store.
Naw.
I kind of like you tellin' me what to do and not to do. Just like my daddy. I didn't mind him tellin' me. I hate Doyle to tell me what to do. Mama said the only way to ever get away from him is for him to get away from us. That we can't leave him or he'll try and hurt her.
My daddy come to the shed out back and got me and said throw this here away and handed me a towel with somethin' in it. I went for the trash barrel there and opened up the towel to see 'cause they was a noise and somethin' movin' in it. Hit was bloody-like around that towel. Hit was a little ol' bitty baby, no bigger than a squirrel.
Hits been hard thinkin' about it. They ain't a day goes by I don't think about it. I kindly have a picture of it up in my head that I see. Hit makes me sad, too. I have bad thoughts on it. I wished they was somethin' I could of did, too. Shouldn't no bad things happen to childern. All the ol' bad things ort to be saved up for folks that's growed up, the way I see it. I shouldn't of told you about that. A boy ort not hear about such things. It just kindly come out.
Seems like Doyle's wormed his way back in. Mama said he's stayin' over tonight and he's talkin' about movin' in for good. We ain't ever gonna be happy. We'll always be nervous, won't we Karl?
Can we play ever' Saturday?
If I ain't too stove up. I ain't like you. I'm old and give out.  I'm proud of ye.
I knowed you'd be here.  What are you a-doin' digging with that stob?
That feller's a whole sight meaner than me. He'd just whup the tar out of me.
I'm tired, too, Frank.  If I ain't around no more, it don't mean I don't care fer ye. I care for ye a good deal. I care for you more than anybody they is. We made friends right off the bat.
Yes sir.
Like something different. I don't know.  You're leavin' ain't you, Karl?
Ever'thing's okay, boy. I kindly want to put my arm around ye for a minute and then I'm gonna go on and leave here.
Did Vaughan go home?
Yeah, he has to go to work in a little while. I do too.
Did Karl go to bed?
Is everything gonna be all right someday? I just stay nervous all the time just about.
Doyle wouldn't really kill you, would he?
We've had a real hard life, too, Mama.
I reckon I'm gonna have to get used to them lookin' at me, too.
I ain't got nothing but them books.
Naw. Never did know too much of nobody. Not to he'p me out anyway.
No, I mean your past. About why you were in here.  I'll take you first thing in the mornin'. You have anyplace you can stay tonight at all? I just can't let you stay here. It's the rules. If something happened well, I'd be liable.
My history.
I knew you'd do all right. Well, I just wanted to check on you. I'll say bye to Bill and get on back.
Want to sit down? Did you need somethin'?
Well, set down and I'll make some biscuits and gravy.
Okay.
Frank, he went off, too. He ain't gonna be in there when you get indoors.
Where'd he go? What's goin' on?
It's been here seventeen years. Did you live here before or something?
What's that you say?
Do you have family here?
So, you're really going to stay here?
Okay, I'll come by Mr. Cox's and get you at noon.
Anyway, it's hard to live gay, that's the right way to say it, in a small town like this. I've wanted to leave many times, but my love for Linda and Frank and another certain person that we won't go into have kept me from it. Anyway, I'm rambling. If you're going to live in the Wheatly garage you need to know that it won't be easy. Doyle is a monster. Not just a closed minded redneck, but a monster. A dangerous person. I've told Linda that one day that man is going to really hurt her or that boy. Maybe even kill one of them. I see it in his eyes. I'm very in tune, maybe even psychic. Doyle will make your life hell. You're a perfect target. When I first saw you I was afraid of you. Not really afraid, I guess, just taken aback. But also, I felt a real sensitive feeling from you. And for some reason, Frank has adopted you. Much like a stray animal. I'm sorry, I didn't mean it like that. In a good way. Anyway, I just want you to know what you're in for. I have a good feeling about you. You're good for Frank. Maybe it's that he can have an adult friend on a child's level. I'm sorry, I didn't mean it in a bad way.  There's one more thing. It's none of my business why you were in the state hospital. Everyone has something in their past, maybe you tried suicide, maybe you did something -- terrible. But what I see before me is a gentle, simple man. All I want you to promise me is that you're capable of being around Linda and Frank. You know. You would never hurt them under any circumstances, would you?
I don't reckon you have to go with women to be a daddy to a boy.  You've been real square dealin' with me. The Bible says two men ort not lay together. But I'll bet you the Good Lord wouldn't send nobody like you to Hades. Some folks calls it Hell, I call it Hades.  That boy lives inside of his own heart. Hits an awful big place. You take care of that boy.
Well, what do we do? We drove all the way out here.
One of his Daddy's Bible lessons I imagine. Y'all pull up a chair. I'll go out and talk to him.
Will he be supervised?
Why?
And your father? Is he from New York?
Your dissertation? What subject do you study?
What else. Of course, what else? And what are you writing about for your thesis?
Which explains why this hasn't been the easiest summer of my life.
Okay. I'll read it tonight and call you tomorrow.  It doesn't seem to be too long.
The boys and I were just having a philosophical discussion about women and cigars. Some interesting connections there, don't you think?
Do you think I could buy some before you leave?
I've never seen anything like it.
Amazing.  I'm not sure I get it, though. I mean, how did you ever come up with the idea to do this ... this project?
It's kind of overwhelming.
For once in my life I managed to keep my mouth shut. There's something to be said for that, I suppose.
Yeah, I know, but I'm trying to cut down.  Somebody's worried about my health.
Ready. Any time you are.
Okay.  You remember how you once asked me how I started taking pictures? Well, this is the story of how I got my first camera. As a matter of fact, it's the only camera I've ever had. Are you following me so far?
Exactly. Life just wouldn't be worth living, would it?
I've got something to talk to you about, and the least you can do is listen. You owe me that much. I drove all the way from Pittsburgh to see you, and I'm not going until you've heard me out.
Yeah, well, I lost my pen. By the time I got a new one, I was clean out of paper.
You're conning me, sweetheart. I ain't responsible for no baby.
Dammit, Auggie, don't ask so many questions. Just get in the car.
Remember that business venture I was telling you about? Well, my tugboat came in. I'm flush.
I can't believe it. Oh God, I can't believe it.  You're an angel, Auggie. An angel from heaven.
I'm sorry, baby. I can't help it.
I don't know. Thirteen, fourteen years. Something like that.
I try not to, anyway. It's better for your health. I mean, look at you, Vincent. You're the guy with the wife and three kids and the ranch house on Long Island. You're the guy with the white shoes and the white Caddy and the white shag carpet. But you've had two heart attacks, and I'm still waiting for my first.
They catch you smoking tobacco, they'll stand you up against a wall and shoot you.
Ten o'clock tomorrow morning. I'll be there.
Shit. I don't want your money, you little twerp.  It's probably stolen anyway.
That's how it is with sidewalks. People come, people go, and they all drop shit on the ground. As soon as you clean up one spot and move on to the next, the first spot is dirty again.
And these?
The refrigerator?
What do you mean, how'd I get in? I pushed the door and walked in. What do you think?
Don't give me any of that. I know he's been here. You can't fool me, mister.
Well, whatever his name is, he's not here anymore. He left two days ago, and I haven't heard from him since.
That's what he said. He told me he lived with his mother and father on East Seventy-fourth Street.
Which brings me back to my original question. What was he doing here in the first place?
And you told your nephew about it?
And nothing. Thomas looked at me straight in the eye and said, "I don't have a father. As far as I'm concerned, that son-of-a-bitch is dead."
You mean she just ran off with him and left her little boy behind?
Jesus.
It's rundown, all right. But drawing a picture won't improve the way it looks.  Let's see what you did, Rembrandt.
Once you look at it, you're going to want to buy it from me. That's guaranteed. And that's the price: five bucks. So if you're not willing to spring for it, you might as well not bother to look. It'll just tear you up inside and make you miserable.
Is there a benefits package, or are you hiring me on a freelance basis?
Paul. Paul Benjamin.
That's how we met. We're members of the International Same Name Club. Believe it or not, there are 846 Paul Benjamins in America. But only two in the New York metropolitan area. That's how Paul and I got to be such good friends. We're the only ones who show up at the meetings.
Aren't you going to say anything?
What do you want me to say?
Baby? And what baby is that?
Yeah? And why is that?
Huh?
No harm done. Everything's okay now.  I've got to be going.
I mean breakfast.
Of course. Where else?
Then what are you doing in Park Slope? It's a little far from home, isn't it?
The what?
The what.  I've kind of run away from home, you see.  It has nothing to do with my parents or money. I saw something I wasn't supposed to see, and for the time being it's best that I keep myself out of sight.
Suit yourself. But if you change your mind, here's the address. 
Nice drawing. Did you do that?
It's strange, though, isn't it? Looking at yourself before you knew who you were.
You'll find juice and eggs and milk in the refrigerator. Cereal in the cupboard. Coffee on the stove. Take whatever you want. But it's time for me to get started in here.
And how long did I tell you you could stay?
I'm sorry I messed up. You've been very kind to me ...  But all good things have to come to an end, right?
Do you need some money? Some extra clothes?
Close the door.  Sit down in that chair.  Now listen carefully. Your Aunt Em came here a couple of days ago. She was sick with worry, out of her mind. We had an interesting talk about you, Thomas. Do you understand what I'm saying? Your aunt thinks you're in trouble and so do I. Tell me about it, kid. I want to hear all about it right now.
Maybe. Or maybe it's the other people who don't belong.
Pick two or three. Now that the coffers are open, you might as well take advantage of me.
Christ. You didn't just see what happened. They dropped the package on the ground and you picked it up.
And started to run.
You have one hell of a knack for getting into trouble, don't you?  So how much does it come to?
Six thousand dollars. Five thousand eight hundred and fourteen dollars, to be exact.
No way. There's no way I'm giving that money back. It's my money now.
If you don't tell me what happened, how do you expect me to know that? I need facts, not opinions.
The water was dripping, see... I turned it off, but it was still dripping, and then Auggie had to go out, and so I left the back room ... And later on ... well, later on ... when Auggie came back ... the whole place was flooded. His Cuban cigars got all messed up ... You know, soaked through ... just when he was about to sell them ... to these rich guys in suits....
No wonder he was angry.
I pay Auggie, and I've got nothing. Eight hundred bucks and a ticket to Shit City.
If you're lucky.  Then again, it depends on what you call living. 
Keep it tonight.  We'll catch fish. I'll see ya back on the docks...
What are you sellin' 'em for? Why don't we start there.
And the blood could <u>not</u> have belonged to defendant.  Seeing that his type is O negative.
Is that your third question?
Why?  We're only talking.
Well, I don't do it for just anybody.
Japanese stick-fighting.  They're trained as kids, y'know.  To kill with sticks.
Like you couldn't believe.
No, sir, I can't.  Not beyond a reasonable doubt.
I have told the truth.
No, you don't.
That's what Mr. Miyamoto reported, and he'd have no reason to lie. He couldn't know that it would help his case.
Just as the freighter comes through? Isn't that quite a coincidence?
He hit his head.  On the way in.
You mean, do I like to take the offensive?  Or hang back and wait.
I should show them an American?
Right.  In the middle.  Of the floor.
It is.
It was dead.  We had it tested. Maybe the D-6 was the spare and he had to use it.
No spare.
Now you've testified that the deceased was a heavy man, and hard to bring out of the net.
The damage was considerable. But she's insured.  Thanks, again.
What else could it be?
So if his head struck something narrow and flat, the gunnel of a boat, a net roller, a fairlead, could that have...
<u>And</u> that you can't say for <u>certain</u> whether the head injury was sustained before or <u>after</u> death?
For the third time, yes.
I wouldn't say encouraged.
That's all he said.
Funny?  In what way?
Fresh!
Manhattans?  This time of night?
Like I was telling you - Little Bonaparte is getting soft.  He doesn't have it here any more.  Used to be like a rock.  Too bad.  I think it's time for him to retire.
Those two musicians from the garage!
First thing tomorrow we're going out to the dog track and put the whole bundle on Greased Lightning.
What are you giving me with the rabbit?
I thought you weren't talking to me.
So I had to rush him to the hospital and give him a transfusion...  Right?
We're not too late, are we?
You've flipped your wig!
The police?  We'd never live to testify. Not against Spats Colombo.  Wabash 1098.
What are you afraid of?  Nobody's asking you to have a baby.  This is just to get out of town. The minute we hit Florida, we'll blow this set-up.
This time I'm not going to let you talk me into something that...
Now you tore the other one.
Look - no butter, no pastry, and no Sugar!
What's the beef?  We're sitting pretty. We get room and board - we get paid every week - there's the palm trees and the flying fish -
What message?  What motorboat?
You got it made, kid.  Fielding wants you to have a little cold pheasant with him on his yacht -
Tell him you get seasick on a yacht. Play miniature golf with him.
Why not?  He keeps marrying girls all the time!
Look, stop treating me like a child. I'm not stupid.  I know there's a problem.
You're out of your mind!  How can you get away with this?
Daphne got a proposal tonight.
Shut up and keep packing.
Get me Room 414.
Drop her a postcard.  Any minute now those gorillas may be up here -
What do you mean, your bracelet? It's our bracelet.
First thing we got to do is get out of these clothes.
Elope?  But there are laws - conventions -
That's all right.  I was afraid it was Sweet Sue. You won't tell anybody, will you?
Oh, I can think of a million things -
When I was a little girl, on cold nights like this, I used to crawl into bed with my sister.  We'd cuddle up under the covers, and pretend we were lost in a dark cave, and were trying to find out way out.
What's the surprise?
When?
We better have a drink first.
We'll rent some at the bathhouse. How about you, Josephine?
She'll rub it on me - and I'll rub it on her - and we'll rub it on each other - bye.
That's from carrying around the bull fiddle.
Yeah - Josephine.
Oh yes, we do!
- and you got to be girls.
Why?
No, thank you.  I'll walk.
They got a Cuban band that's the berries. Why don't we go there - blindfold the orchestra - and tango till dawn?
You know something, Mr. Fielding? You're dynamite!
You're a pretty hot little firecracker yourself.
We can have it altered.
Why not?
I don't care.
We'll adopt some.
We won't breathe a word.
You won't breathe nothing' - not even air.
And you'll be in all evening?
We'll take it!
All right - lets take it from the top. And put a little heat under it, will you?
If they catch me once more, they'll boot me out of the band.  You the replacement for the bass and the sax?
Don't get me started on that.  Want a drink?  It's bourbon.
Bingo?
You don't know what they're like. You fall for them and you love 'em - you think it's going to be the biggest thing since the Graf Zeppelin - and the next thing you know they're borrowing money from you and spending it on other dames and betting on the horses -
Then one morning you wake up and the saxophone is gone and the guy is gone, and all that's left behind is a pair of old socks and a tube of toothpaste, all squeezed out.
Good night, Sugar.
I'll bet there isn't one of them under seventy-five.
I don't think so.
No, my flag steward.
And who mixes the cocktails - your wife?
What theory?
Why?
Because he said he's coming to hear us play - maybe.
Well, you know how those millionaires are.  These came for you.
It's not how long you wait - it's who you're waiting for.
I wanted them to fly down some orchids from our greenhouse but all of Long Island is fogged in.
Well, that depends - on whether you're coming or going - I mean, normally the aft is on the other side of the stern - and that's the bridge - so you can get from one side of the boat to the other - how about a glass of champagne?
You're flattering me.
Well, I don't know how to put it - but I have this thing about girls.
They just sort of leave me cold.
You mean - like frigid?
You poor, poor boy.
All right - if you insist.
Lets throw another log on the fire.
Eight hundred and fifty thousand dollars.
Did you have a nice time?
Oh, of course.  I understand.  At least, I think I do.
Well, anchors aweigh, you have a bon voyage.  And if you need an orchestra to play at your wedding, we'll be through here in a couple of weeks.
Coffee?
Embalming people with coffee - eighty-six proof.
Come on, Spats - we know you own this joint.  Mozarella is just fronting for you.
I heard you opera-lovers were having a little rally - so I thought I better be around in case anybody decides to sing.
Because the day after the shooting you sent in a pair of spats - they had blood on them.
Yeah.  You never know who's going to be next.  Okay, Spats.  Report to the Sergeant- at-Arms.
Just dropped in to pay my respects.
Theres finally a reason for the whole world to revolve around you?
Drunk isnt the same thing as happy, Amy.
When I freaked out at the pub?  That was nothing, just nerves. Dont worry about it.
You practically bribed him with your erector set.
Sure, disappear. Weve been walking away our whole lives.
If Ed ever found out....
Jeffrey told her last night.
Why should this be any different?  Besides, I have to initiate Nick into the family.
Theres a reason I always tell that Tony Pee-Pants story, you know.
Trust me. This is bigger than Tony Pee-Pants.
So she flirted with Tony, and you got mad and sent him away. Who did that leave?  You and Amy. Reunited.
Other than, hes shagging your exgirlfriend?
No.
Hello, Katmandu.
Yeah?
Maybe not her least... Theres always--
Its called character. God, youre predictable.
Not for a dog.
Its not supposed to be anything, Kat. Its just my rather feeble attempt to.... Oh, I dont know.  You see, I thought I could deny my feelings--
I slept with your sister.
Youre funny.
Im desperate to start but I dont have an addictive personality. Except for approval. That, I cant get enough of.
I think thats disgusting.
Yeah. As an adult, I needed to find some way to experience intimacy and sex, but with rules that couldnt be violated.
This is awkward for me.  Talking about it makes me feel better.
Okay.
Of course not. How...how could it be? Nothing happened.
I just hate seeing you so stuck.
So, whyd you say yes to me?
I don't know, he's in a prison camp.
What do I tell my mama when I get home? I didn't find him and that's what I wanted to do.
You would do that, wouldn't you?
You getting the point, Mrs. Boatwright.
It's cold, Daddy!
Yeah. We better git back to house now.
We goin' huntin' again tomorrow ?
"You lose some of the time, what you always go afta, but you lose all the time what you don't go afta!"
Hi, Daddy...
Hi to you, son...
Naww -- he'll come back to you, soon as his wounds heal. This cake shore is tasty, son.
I think so...
Into the clouds and behind the mountains.
When's that?
Never heard of 'im. We gotta lotta men here...
My father taught me...
Then why don't he holler like he usta?
That's right!
Good! But you don't have to tell the whole valley 'bout it! You'll get that woman in trouble!
But you'll be away from home for days -- what will you do when the dark comes, where will you sleep? I can't send you away from here like that!
Yes mam... We gotta go, Miss Boatwright.. .
No, he was wrong, David, I didn't find out.
And if they saw me pitch the way I did today -- they'd hire me just to strike out Babe Ruth!
Maybe soon--
Is he gon' be gone long?
I hope it ain't a lot,'cause I can't give you no more credit till the croppin' season gits back, that is if Na--
I just got out here!
It's not that simple, Sister Rebecca -- the Lord works in mysterious ways -- we come into this life with nothin' and we'll leave it with nothing.
You mean to tell me I can't see my own husband?
NO WAY, DUDE! I'VE LOOKED ALL OVER FOR YOU, AND NOW YOU HAVE TO TELL ME HOW TO GET WENDY TO LIKE ME!!
YOU JUST DON'T CARE!
The Canadians are just mad that we mothers here in South Park have the chutzpah to stand up to them!  Like it or not, Mr. Canadian Minister, OUR children are now safe from your Canadian smut!
Montana.
Alright, now I want you to say 'horsefucker.'
I hate the environment.
Fragile?
Yeah,  <b>Shut your fucking face, Unclefucka!!</b>
God Damn it your mom is a bitch, Kyle.
The rest of you are graduated. You can go home today.
Then move out of the way.
Mrph mprhm mm rmph!
Do as I say, Kyle!
MOM!!!
KYLE BROVLOFSKI, YOU WATCH YOUR LANGUAGE!!
What's the password?
Yeah, I guess.
Careful? Was my mother careful when she stabbed me in the heart with a clothes hanger while I was still in ze womb?
It's okay, I am done for.
How do we do that?
Are you sure, Kenny?
Yeah, so what if you say uncle raper or dicksucker or, or-
YES! AND I WILL NOT ALLOW MY CHILDREN TO BE RUINED BY SMUT!!  I am sorry young man, but I have had it up to here! STRAP THEM IN!
Yes?
I'm needing lunch.
And I thought my mother was the master of guilt.  Geez Louise.
Ooh yes. I think we'll have to give detention to those boys.
This is NOT a place for fun and games! This is rehabilitation! Now GET TO IT!! We at MAC have a trial to go to!
Alright, I'll make the call...
Yeah, God, no wonder your country is so fucked up.
Canada is saving us!!
Sometimes I just think you don't have any respect for me.
Is sex the only thing that matters to you?
That's because I wanted to fuck you, dumbass! Now hows aboot you get those pants down!
Well I just want you to be impressed with what I <u>do</u>. I want you to respect my MIND.
I DO respect your mind! It turns me on! It makes me wanna fuck the shit out of you! Don't you see?
Can we talk about this later?  Everyone is watching!
Listen guy, you're embarassing me in front of my friends!  You know how I get mad when I get embarassed.
This is about freedom of speech, Stan, about censorship.
Nothing, Stan. You wouldn't understand.
Wow, I have a clitoris too.
Check.
And the butfor?
I'll tell you what I'm going to do.
Well get used to it, 'cause here we are, on the cruise of a lifetime.
Well you did the right thing Mac.
I hear you Mac and I appreciate it. Frankly I don't know what I'd have done without you on this one.
There is a high level...of passenger 					dissatisfaction.
All right, I'll give it a shot.
I don't know.  Everything's up in the air at this point, no pun intended.
Uh...
Well, maybe I will.  You sure you don't want anything?
That's me.
Yeah, I know Bill, I came up with the plan remember?  Just have those hangar doors open and ready, I can take it from there.
I told you, I had to teach a few people a lesson!
Don't say that!  It ain't over till it's over!
That's right.
Can't we access the mainframe to check the ship's condition?
Even if we do, it might be too late.
Wait.
Ready as I'll ever be.
Don't worry about me.  Where are we going?
Words to live by.
Thanks for everything, Taylor. Will I see you again?
Marry you?
Thank you.
No, just enjoying the view.
I guess so.
How can you sit there with your fat stomach and tell me to take it easy!  I want to go home!  I want to be warm!  I want to get out of here!
Because, Taylor wouldn't do that, that's why.
What kind of man?
The pin machine?
You afraid we're gonna steal it?
I remember, Sid! Mr. Kastle says he don't like no sticky fingers in the till.
Bowling was the most incorruptible sport. No megalomillionaires, no 
Wait! That's an aria!
Nectar of the bowling gods, Faz.
Theo.
100 years! 
I've never had orange whips, I'm from Akron.
Yeah, against that prick VanDeMark.
Grace Skinner.
I couldn't pay someone enough to try to kill me. Sheila comes over to take their orders.
I'm your blood.
You're dead without the pro-tour, and you know it. Get him away from me. Sid and Breeze punch Theo in the face.
You got a better offer?
I didn't think so.
He says that to all his wives.
I am underground.
Thanks, kid.  Where are you goin' now?
We should leave this town. I can't take this anymore. I'm not gonna let him kill you in my house.
Hey man, welcome to our parking lot. Lemme give you some advice, if she asks you to dance, make sure her brother's not around. Somebody blew out Junior's pilot light, if you get my meaning.
What did your dad tell you to do to Buzz? Theo scrambles up the lane on hands and knees. Junior catches him, grabbing his ankles.
I have someone for you to play Blueface with Junior.
Blueface! Blueface is my favorite.
Maybe I can help you.  Try a lighter ball, Penelope - you'll get hurt with that big ball, honey.  I've seen tapes of you bowling on the circuit. You got Fazeli blood running through you. Your pop was a genuine talent in his day.
He's earned an early retirement.  But enough about losers; Buzz Fazeli is history. Lets talk about your future.  I wanna show you something.
Ssssh! Now real quiet. On three. One...two...three!
After we eat, Dad.
132, 154.
Four or five years when a girl like that's bowling on the pro tour for Team Kastle, she'll pay a handsome profit on my investment.
That's right, sugar, find the grip that's right for you. Then grasp firmly. The camera weaves past a five foot pink whale with a gaping green mouth leading onto a mini-green.
I'm a bowler.
I'm sorry about Zeus, Millie.
Isn't this technically a scooter?
Do you have a girlfriend?
Do you have a boyfriend?
Well, that was plan A.
What's plan B?
I could let them go for ten.
If you want a professional man, you have to be willing to pay for him.
You're here.
No, but something's gonna blow in this town. I can feel it.
I can't tell you, Theo.
Tell me, Sheila. What are you afraid of? Sheila shakes her head.
It's Junior, isn't it.
It?
SSHHEEIILLAAA!
You think I'm dumping you to get back into bowling. Well who's dumping who?
Your time is up, busyboy.
They're like pink snow, sir.  Sticky.
It's burning...
Yeasts?  Thank you, Beth, but I don't think we're gonna open it up and find a loaf of bread.
It sends 200 volts throughout the cylinder surface.  But we've never used it underwater before.
Do it, Norman, it's the only choice we have.  This thing is gonna crush us.
Then why am I here?
I'm afraid it is Dr. Johnson... because it's sitting on the bottom of our ocean floor.
It doesn't make any sense.
We think it might.  That's why we brought you here.  We've assembled your team -- they're waiting for us now.
It's a corrosive gas.  On earth, it makes a half-eaten apple turn brown and puts the ugly, iron rust on an Oldsmobile.  At a pressure this low, oxygen becomes toxic.  Breathe it down here, and it'll do to your dick what it does to the Oldsmobile.
I don't know.  But it's something alien.
What?
What do you mean, he's missing?
I told you people, nobody goes anywhere unless I say.
When was this?
Maybe so.  But I think we need to ask Jerry about it.
Pull it.
Working on it now, sir.
If the subs aren't here yet, sir --
Then how can it be chipped?
We know how this craft got here. Where it's been.
Ted seems to have some ideas.
How do you mean, strange?
What do you make of this?
What would we be working on in the future that would make us want to come back?
Sir, about leaving --
What was Edmunds doing outside?
Resetting the sub.
In the dome hanger.  All our tapes are transferred to the sub.  It's on a 12 hour timer.  If someone doesn't reset the "delay" button, the sub ascends to the surface with the tapes.
I love secrets.
Well, you must have realized the chances an encounter like this would happen here.  In the ocean.  70 percent of the earth's surface is water, Norman.  That's first grade geography.
Get this thing off me.
We have a library?
Beth --
They are or they aren't.  Which is it?
Where did you get this?
Don't bother me, Norman.
It's not worth the risk.
You, me and Harry?
Get the helium out of our bloodstream.  We go to the surface now, we'd pop like a soda bottle.
Still clear.
He what?
All I know is I opened that refridgerator --
But how?
Nothing about drowsiness.
Causes sleep.
The grooves around the door -- they've shifted.  And the pattern -- the fluids -- they look darker now.
Are you?
Am I afraid of them?  Not during the day.  Sea snakes are diurnal.  When the sun's out, they don't bite. Fortunately for you, I had on my watch.  This is quite good.
Did you?
He can't manifest.
No, he can't.
Then why, Beth?  Why go in?  Why put out explosives?  Why manifest the snakes?
You're lying --
From you, Norman.  From your mind. You're doing it.
It's you, Norman.  Your fear of drowning.  You have to face it.
Who says it's a he?
A light switch.  A button opened that door -- the craft runs on some sort of power.
Yeah, I don't know how you could make that confusion.
Like what?  I'm not --
No idea.  We have no surface support. It transmitted too fast to be coming from underwater.
Good point.  I don't know what you're talking about, but good point.
I'm completely serious.  There is something very important missing from that spacecraft.  You know what that is?
You were all supposed to leave.  You weren't supposed to stay down here.
What happens on page 87?  Have you ever read page 87?
There's some sort of pattern here. It'll take a minute.
Did I?
Norman, where are you?
What happened to her?
You didn't say that about the food?
How far away's the sub?
Her legs are in the way.
Well, press something!
We all kill ourselves?  Bad joke.  Sorry, Beth.
Norman thinks we shouldn't be going down.  Thinks it's a mistake.
Meaning?
Yeah, I'll work on it, too.
About the time paradox.  How we were all going to die -- that there was no way we would make it out of here alive --
Really?
You've heard of me?
What report?
Try this one.
Why's that?
I'm not sure.
There's nothing on the news about a crash.  Did he say what airline?
Their bases are very well hidden. All the power of the Empire can't find them... Do you know where they are?
I think there are some things we should talk about.
I'm beginning not to like you.
Fear is their greatest weapon.
It's not good... unless I could find the Crystal.  Then it could be very good.
But you are... I know your 'Diary of the Clone Wars' by heart.  My father...
You could put it that way.
I assure you my intentions weren't bad.
My father told me many stories about you.  He said if I was ever in trouble, to come here... I need your help.
Not any more!
What do you mean?
But you're still a powerful Jedi. You don't need my help.
What do I do?
Yes, sir.
Have you been checked out?
I've got it blocked.  I'm all right.
Yes, your highness. I'll let you open it then.  It won't be too long before they figure out what happened to us.  This has turned into a brilliant escape!
Where are you taking us now anyway?
Don't you believe it.
You're good with 'remotes,' but how are you against something living?
Well, if it's not, we'll be facing that Death Star all by our lonesome.
Thanks, old buddy.  I'll be with you in a second.
You'll get no information from me. You have no authority... the council can't hold me!
It appears your ship had an accident. I will see to it that your death is duely reported.  There will be no one to save you this time.
They'll find its weakness.
You rich kids... are all the same !
I joined up for her. I wouldn't even be here if it wasn't for her. I'm a fool.
Down there on the flats, eh ? Listen up, Roughnecks ! Our primary objective is to assist our friends from the Fleet...
Are you rated to repair a Marauder power suit, Rico ?
Sir, no, sir.
Sir, I needed everyone in my squad operational, sir... I... I wanted to win, sir.
I gave him the impression that there was a fly crawling up my mom's leg. He is going to go eat it.
I can't... but like I told you, it's a number's game. The Federation needs all the pilots it can get...
Yeah, we know each other from the game. No hard feeling, eh, chum ?
This isn't simulation anymore. Take'er out easy, cadet.
Forget it, Carmen. The Mobile Infantery does a thankless, dirty job, so they naturally tend to be short-tempered, thoughtless and rude.
Zander, no...!
Johnny, my Dad's home today.
Well, if your dad doesn't like me, how come we're such good friends ?
Whoa ! Way to go, boy-yo !
What happened to your eye ?
Bug Batteries... According to Military Intelligence, it'll be random and light. Drop status ?
Well, anyone who gets you is lucky.
You saying you didn't ?
Hey, they humiliated me in front of everyone ! I'm just supposed to take it, huh ? Well, I'm not gonna, and I guess that proves I just can't cut it.
What's that, Diz ?
Nah, I don't do that anymore...
I said no. Want me to pull rank ?
What ?
They ran out of names a long time ago in this part of the galaxy.
Looks like rain.
Yes, sir ! Fleet, this is Roughneck patrol, over ...?
Must fill your bottle up real quick when your wife and kids get smeared.
Which do you think is more important, courage or confidence ?
Uh, no.
Well, that's what you're saying ! You're saying that I'm not good enough the way I am now !
You can never be sure.
That would mean a comlete disregard for the mission objective. They hang you for that, Rico.
Move out.
Inside 4th brigade compound ? That's crazy !
Kill the bitch.
Who's that with you ?
Yes, sir.
Looks like a bug was in his brain, sir.
Not until V'ger withdraws the devices orbiting the third planet.
Because V'ger is going to destroy all the carbon units on the third planet.
V'ger will comply if the carbon units disclose the information.
Carbon units are not true life forms... Do those images repre- sent how Enterprise has evolved into its present form?
Enterprise should not require the presence of carbon units.
The carbon units are of no consequence; V'ger will determine their purpose.
V'ger is announcing that it has arrived, sir -- that it's ready to deliver the information it was programmed to collect...
'To learn all that is learnable.'
Mr. Scott... on my next signal.
My experience -- five years out there dealing with unknowns like this -- my familiarity with the Enterprise, this crew...
No, Admiral. I don't think you are; not one damned bit. I remember when you recommended me for this command. You told me how envious you were, and if only you could find a way to get a starship command again. Well, sir, it looks like you found a way.
I'm aware of that, sir.
That thing is twenty hours from Earth. We know nothing about it yet.
How do you define <U>unwarranted</U>, <U>mister</U>?!
Forcefields, full remaining strength...! Total reserve!
And plug the signal directly into the circuitry at this...  ... point here, Captain. It should pick up even a tricorder playback.
Decker....!
If I'd seen you again, would you have been able to say it?
Mr. Decker, I will not provoke an attack, If that order isn't clear to you...
Our... 'insignificance'?
Instruments fluctuating, Captain. Patterns unrecognizable.
I am uneasy with that being our only hope of more information.
I am seeking answers, Captain.
Why aren't you on board?
Here at Starfleet...? The Enterprise is in final preparation to leave dock...
Which will require twenty more hours at minimum, Admiral...
Engineer, we need Warp speed now!
Tractor beam remains constant...
Go you Huskies?
I have one, but they lost it.
You haven't heard of it.
Well.  Everybody has reversals.  If you were never down how would you know when you were up?
Yes.
No, of course, you want to get out of town.
But why the dalmation?
That, he says, there <u>are</u> no second chances...that he's been presented what he <u>prayed</u> for...and: he's ruined it.
...that...he <u>sees</u> that...
...that it has been vouchsafed to him.
Goodbye.
...that.
Well, I guess I'll...get down to the station.  It was lovely meeting...
You'd know better'n me.
What are you <u>doing</u> tonight?
Me?
You got a paperclip?
Me, too.  You have a paperclip?
"To the love of my life, Love, Doug"?
You, um, you, um, you going out with your fiance?
You believe that?
Time for a change.  Keep your margins straight.
...her unbridled sexuality.  That he...
Hi.
Where you going?
What?
...how <u>else</u> can you talk?
Yep.  N'it's for sale.  One of the few things money can buy.
I'd love to.
You'd do the newspaper right here.
What?
But it'll stop the movie.
Tuesdays and Thursdays.  But after Play Practice, I'm yours.
Let me review here: You're...what are you...you've...it's all over between us?
What're you doing here...?
It's what you give to your secretary instead of a raise.
Uh, <u>look</u>....
Look:  Okay.  Okay.  Look:  look you're driving, countryside, so on, you picked her up, she was hitch...
Nobody knows it but us.  Alright?  It says <u>here</u>...  Are we together on this?  Because it's sink or swim here, pals...
What'll I do for fun?
Nothing happened.
I'm having dinner with W...
Well, I can offer you something to drink?
How old are you?
You want to see it better, we could go out on the roof.
What...
I've always seen that.
How could she turn on me like that?  I thought she liked me.
Mr. Barrenger.
Of course he...
Well, Officer, don't worry ab...
If there's anything I...
We know that you weren't.
Get him on the...
<u>You</u> know...Where's your bathroom?
Look, look, I like you <u>very much</u>...
How can I thank you?  How can I repay you for this part?  It's a...what a, thank you for this part.  The first scene at the Old Mill...
How many times in your <u>life</u> do you get a speech like that?
I can't do it, Walt.
I don't want to take my shirt off in that con...What are these things that they're asking of me...?  Wha...wha...wha... I try to be good; the only thing I care about is...
Listen to me:  Elanora <u>Duse</u> was playing Hamlet in London in 1905, and Royalty could not get a ticket.  She said, "I'm not doing the seven shows a week I signed for."  She said, "I cannot bare my soul seven times a week.  I am an artist. I'll do four shows a week."  The greatest actress of her time.  You know what her Producer said?
No, she didn't Claire.  But I think you should do the scene.
I know, I know.
I'll put the, in your r...
That's cor...
Did she throw up?
Why?
Main Street.
Doug, the traffic light...
Doug, this is Mr...
This young woman.
You've got nothing, you don't have a witness...
What the hell are <u>you</u> so down about?
Mmmm.  You have children?
You should.
You mean <u>with White</u>...?
You mean you need a witness in addition to White...?
He saw the accident...?
Sure.
He saw the girl in the car...
I have to talk to you.  My wife...
You built an Old Mill in New Hampshire...
Where have you been...?
I'm out.
The girl was in the car.
The breasts symbolize motherhood...
Well, then, you didn't see it, right...?
You were there.  At...at 10:35...?
What glasses were you wearing?  Were you wearing your reading glasses...?
What'd you do, <u>build</u> this...?
How was your flight?
We're flying over pigs, we're flying over <u>sheep</u>...
Did you bring Bob's weights?
That's why I <u>want</u> it.  Type it up and get it back to me in...
Would you, tell the guy, get the A.D., someone, somewhere where we can <u>get</u> <u>away</u>, something, I want, you know, last day before the shooting, get away, forget it, have some local food.  You want...
Sherry, this...
Aren't these <u>illegal</u>?
Zat what it takes?  I always <u>wondered</u> what it took...
Well Daddy and I were thinking that sometimes people tell a story about what they wish would happen.
I don't want that to happen.  Why would I want that to happen?
Never say never you always say that. I'll bet daddy's mad at me now.
Annabelle, daddy and I will always be there. That's one time always is always.  You can call him after dinner but...
I live.  In the same country.
...why do you think?
Are you <u>kidding</u>?  It is <u>so</u> much better than the one Rachel showed me!
Every time I'm on the lunch yard, and he's with twelve of his retarded <u>dorkface</u> little adoring out-crowd <u>henchmen</u>...
Oh, yeh.
I'm not.
Yes.
And this is my room so get out!
See, I...
Ice cold water.
There's worse things.
No!  You're cheating -- you have to start from the beginning and you have to read the whole thing I can't sleep otherwise.
No, that's your fault.  It's her fault for not watching over my precious son, as if it were her priority.  Which means, the most important job.
Honey, this is Thursday.  I pick you up tomorrow, and we do <u>big</u> spaghetti.
Of course, you do.  Being magic. Then you know I've got a flu bug, and I turn green and barf profusely when I even think about food.  So, all the more meatballs for you.  But you know what.
Where Ben?
Rache can do that part.
So where are you?
Every day.  More and more.
Remarried.  There is no move.
Because you don't really seem here.
You're WHERE?
We...
Stop.  You're making me insecure.
Yeh, better I should forcefeed him burnt lamb and...couscous, was it she made him?  Boy, kids go wild for that.
I'm sure that didn't upset her. Everyone in our family takes showers.
You're not terribly good at taking care of h...
I did it for her.
No way.  I told her two, three years, maybe, for such an expens...
Wowie.  How wonderful!
How would you know <u>anything</u>?
Do what you've worked your whole life to do?
It's the same choice you made.
Feeling the pressure?
Are we.
Don't be too sure.
Is scary.  But you want it.  Gimme some truth here.
You know every story, every wound, every memory, their whole life's <u>happiness</u> has been wrapped up in <u>you</u>, every moment...
We have to talk.
Jesus.
Just a babysitter -- I mean...you're working...
You don't need to.  I don't expect you to handle them yourself.
I know how responsible, caring adults parent children.  I'm bribe 'em.  But 'em a dog or something.  Maybe a Doberman.
Hey, I sold my body to Satan to clear Friday at two o'clo...
Our weekend.  At that sweet little B &amp; B.
You haven't done <u>one</u> goddam thing to make any of this easier...
Okay...Is that the good thing or the bad thing?
Rache, it may take time.
It's no biggie.
Well, they will be.
Tucker hasn't penned Ben's present yet -- it won't be too much longer.
What if he is?
Oh, yeah?
There's something I need to talk about with you.
I'll be your guest!
TV talk-show host, OK. You were at sidekick eight seconds ago, then TV talk-show host. You'll be a Latin dictator in a bout a minute.
It was God's will.
I did not go to high school.
I'm always working.
Who is Jesus?
He's dead.
It is when you love someone, and they don't love you. And then you do something about it.
You're showing how superior you are to your subject. TOBY No, but I like my subject. I like these people.
I dunno, Toby. We really have a long way to go. You still need a lot more footage, and it's probably a little premature to start screening
What's an audience going to tell you?
I don't know. Maybe they'll like it.
Got a lot of homework?
You know, you have to. Sometimes you just have to, Toby.
He's right.
Of course, honey. Come in bed with us. Come on.
Ready for tomorrow?
You mean, again?
Well, I changed the ending a little.
Oh. What happens now?
Well then, maybe you should just read the ending.
You'll read it in class tomorrow. Surprise me.  Anyway, I have to go. I promised Melinda I'd help her with her oral.
You know he hated my story also.
Your story was terrible!
That's not fair! I was honest! Just because I wasn't sucking up like 	that bitch Catherine.
Well, I sure didn't hear you voice your opinion in there when it mattered.
You're absolutely right. The focus is on the college admissions process today.
I have a cousin. Very big giver to the alumni fund.
Dad, I'm trying to figure things out right now, OK? It's like, really hard, and I'm just listening to some old Elton John and...
Say, Ni...
...gger.
Again!!
Any books you like to read for fun?
Who is this?
Toby Oxman.
So what's going on?
That's what I was gonna ask you.
But...you called.
N-not yet. I'm hoping to get a grant for this one project on teenagers. Geez, remember when we were teenagers?
Yeah...um...so anyway, tell me. What about you? I'd heard through the grapevine you were producing movies.
Yeah.
Great. How old are they?
I mean...
Well...it's kind of a sociological study in the aftermath of Columbine.
Doubt it.
Well get someone down there!
Why? Are we going dancing?
No but you didn't defend him either! Didn't want to rock the boat.  Guess the ride was too smooth. FILMORE I was acting under legal counsel!
Yeah?...
Rule two:  without alternative, use yourself as a shield.
It's nothing to worry about.
I don't know.  If you gave me a reason to...
Yes, you should.
I said I don't want any, goddammit!
We have a special forces squadron out of Thailand surrounding the compound as we speak.
I'm sure you'll figure it out.
I'll let the senator tell you.
I'm in to the directory but they've codified the stockpile--numerically.
We're almost done piping in directly to the Olympia.  Should have it all in about an hour or so.
We can't--it's power driven!
Now, Mister Ambassador.  In a very few moments we should have Premier Belch on the phone.  I intend to tell him exactly what has happened.  I merely want you to authenticate certain facts for him.
I have your word, Mister President?
Did you get that, Kulnick?
I am sorry.  Sub-miniature photography is my hobby.  It's amazing what excellent en- largements you can make from the negative.
I'll hold this, if you don't mind.  You can have it back when you leave.
First of all, economic reasons.  It was cheap.  The entire project cost just a fraction of what we spent in a single year on our various space and missile programs. It also seemed ideal in most other respects. It was terrifying, convincing, automatic, and extremely simple to understand.
The report is entirely untrue.  I can assure you of that.
Bah!  All you wanted to do was spy in our country!
Oh, yes, that's right.
Colonel, don't you know what's going on?
Sure I do.  There was some kind of mutiny on the base, and you killed General Ripper.
Look, General Ripper went off his rocker and ordered the 843rd Bomb Wing to attack with H-bombs.
Yes, sir.
Condition Red!
Major, that's all I've been told.  Just got it on the red phone.  The base is to be sealed tight.  And I mean tight.
Who do you think you're talking to?
Please don't take any notice of this weapon, Major.  I love all weapons, and as of late, I've just taken to keeping a loaded weapon nearby at all times.
Yes, sir.  General, can I ask a question?
Certainly, Major Mandrake.  You're a good officer, and you can ask me a question any time you want to.
You know the regulations well, Major.
But then why do you want to kill a hundred and sixty million of our people, sir?
Our missiles would impact before my planes were even discovered by the enemy, wouldn't they?
Where?  Everywhere, Major.  Everywhere.
Yes, sir.  But so do we.
That's right, sir.  And don't forget in a few years a lot of other countries will have the bomb.  What if they start something?
If they gave us what we think we need, yes, I guess we would.
Look, sir.  I'm no expert on the subject, but I've read some pretty sharp ideas the big boys have.  Like, say, both countries agreeing to a million dollar reward and international protection for anyone who gives evidence of cheating to the inspectors. You can't hide those things without a lot of people knowing about it.  And if I were going to try and hide a few, I wouldn't want to depend on the fact that some poor slob isn't going to run and blab for a million bucks.  We're as smart as they are, and if they cheat, or even hold back information, we'd pull right out.
Well, what about the Positive Control, the safety catch?  Don't the planes automatically come back unless they get a second order?
What the hell is Plan-R?
Knock it off will you, General?  Crudley, find out what's holding up that call!
How many planes did we lose?
Well, if you choose to take his word over mine ---
Well, sir, if the A/C's a really good man, I mean really sharp, why he can barrel that plane along so low - well you just have to see it some time.  A real big plane, like a Sting Ray, zig-zagging in, its jet exhaust frying chickens in the barnyard ---  Has he a chance?.....Hell, yes!  He has one hell of a chance.
Zlat, make sure the secret service boys care- fully search his seven body orifices.
Thanks, Binky.  Can you see Bromdingna Island yet?
The dirty, stinking, rotten, sons of B's!! They might have clobbered Marge and the
What?
War.
War?
They must have been fired from Bromdingna - probably one of their new Vampire - 202's. They've got a range well over a hundred miles.
I just got another blast on the CRM-114, and the damned thing decodes: Wing Attack, Plan-R.
As soon as I've checked over the route. About five minutes.  All right?
Master Kong.
Sure!  Sure, I'm on my way.
No, I think it means, "Recall period Mistake," and the OPE is probably the CRM-114 code. Terry?
Well, we sure as hell aren't going home just because the enemy tells us to.
That's the point.
Take it easy, Major Kong.
Well, I can't get out and look, King.  But I don't get a green light.
Listen, Lothar.  You know that crack I made about your...butt?
Certainly not, sir.  When they go down into the mine, everyone else will still be alive.  They will have no shocking memories, and the prevailing emotion should be one of a nostalgia for those
Alright. She told him to meet us here. Fuck.
Can I have some?
Yeah.
How long were you in there?
No. Oh, maybe. Fuck.
Yeah, I'm a nurse's aide at Mercy.
Oh, some of 'em. But it's mostly just strokes and shit. I mean, most of 'em just sleep all the time and get kind of yellow. Usually they die id they're, you know, really yellow.
Needs some pizza in his diet.
Yo, your gettin' me all upset here.
Shut up! Aw...
What?
No, uh, nobody. It's, uh, it's my birthday this week and Sooze's brother might come by to wish me a happy birthday.
The dude wants it.
That sounds so depressing.
I'm saying no, I'm saying after a while it'd wear thin.
... idiot! Open the damn door! Go, go, go, come on!
You know what? Go with him. Just go with him.
Huh? No, alright. Well, you know what we need? A hot cop of coffee. Hand on. Ohh, hey, I was up all night too, man. A long, long, long night.
Uh, Buff, I'm, I'm, gonna tell you something and, uh, you got, you got, you gotta promise not to tell anyone, alright?
Hey, you know me.
Because since I'm just starting out, I've got a fresh point of view, and that's good for, you know, marketing, demographics...
Erica is in the van back there.
Hey, man.
Yeah, man.
No.
Alright. 'Bye, Buff.
You're fascist, man. Neofascist.
Buff, please, would you jus fuck off, okay? Fuck off!
Playing with something really hot. Yeah.
Hey, hey, seven-twenty. Seven-twenty.
Yo! Your spitting rice all over us! God.
You're a drunk and an idiot.
No, no, whoa!
Uh, you know, just admiring the scenery, you know?
Alright, get in the car before I have to embarrass you in front of your friend.
Military marching bands.
You think I'm rich and you hate me.
You cut off your little finger?
Erica.
Erica. So do you think you and I are alike, Erica?
It's a mistake to think that.
I mean, we've been playing big places everywhere, but when we did that sound check at The Orpheum, it suddenly hit me. I'm playing The Orpheum, you know? I mean, the last time I played here was, uh, the prom.
We were?
He wrote this thing about his dick once and he read it in front of the whole class.
Yeah, well, he's from a Third World country. He doesn't have it easy.
Actually, the only thing I gotta give that guy is a one-way ticket back to Greaseball-land.
What?
Fuck 'em! Fuck 'em all, man!
Well, w-what happened?
Yeah, of course they let me out. Chickenshits. I gotta pay some class C misdemeanor ticket. So did I call it or did I call it? She spent the night, didn't she? Hm? Oh, that sucks for you, pal. Oh, shit.
No, no. That's not the way it is at all. No, I stayed up all night trying to figure out how to protect my best friend. Wait, yeah, no, I was trying to come up with some lie so that you wouldn't have to go to jail for the rest of your life.
The sun hasn't even come up yet and you're drinking.
No.
Hey, Ma, look at me! Top of the world, Ma!
I don't know. I think she's breathing.
No, no. It's an honest question. What are you trying to communicate?
Sexual politics, racism, the environment, the military industrial...
I'm talking about idealism.
What? What do you stand for?
Can I talk?
Um, because you didn't want to go.
Okay, what would you have done.
Of course.
So what do you wanna do?
No, I don't.
No, no. I just got sick and tired of listening to that demo tape over and over again, you know? I mean, I felt like a fucking groupie, you know.
I'm leaving. Is that alright with you? Do I have your permission? Maybe you want to think about it.
Wait, away?
Yes, Jeff, away. Away, away, away.
Wait. What, what are you saying?
What about us? I'm moving away your staying here.
No, maybe not though. That, that's what I'm trying to say.
You did, huh? Good for you.
Just go.
Yeah, hey I saw your album at Musicland up at the mall.
For a while.
What do you mean?
Yeah, well, that's what I do too.
What?
Oh, yeah.
Oh, no, no. Uh, uh, George, pull over.
Hey, you know what? Go fuck yourself.
You know what? Go ahead and shoot me. Go ahead! Fucking shoot me! Come on! Come on, man! Come on!
Wow. Hey, you look good. Like you, you know, head's in a good place, you know? You, are still doing your painting?
Oh, yeah?
You do not!
You do not want me to do your cover.
Yep.
Oh, How'd she get back?
Yeah? Well, what'd she say?
Yeah?
So where are you?
Tim's jealous, you know? He wants to have ideas too.
Yeah. Yeah, I'm jealous of MTV faggots who are named after animals.
NO-GAH-BUH- NO!  Rule number two - NO NAMES!  NO GODDAMN NAMES, you retard!
Cleo!
Positive.
If you don't - can you still afford to go to Harvard?
I've got to get that.  Relax.  I'll see you tomorrow.
If you could be Count Chocula, Frankenberry or Trix the Rabbit, who'd you be?
Jus some girlie things for the squad.
We were told you could "fix us up."
Ooops, that's me -- gotta run!
You're kidding.
I-I'm sorry - can someone else please run the Ouija board?  It's creepy, it's wrong and it goes against the teachings of my Lord and Savior, Jesus Christ.
I know, Hannah.  Look, I'm not going to get an abortion.  I mean, I always planned to get married and have kids - I'm just going a little out of order. Kinda reminds me of another young lady who found herself "with child," unmarried, on a long road, with no place to sleep.  'Course, that was a long-long time ago.  But no matter what, she held her head high and said... "Pappa don't preach, I'm in trouble deep.  Pappa don't preach, 'cause I'm keepin' my baby.  Hey.  I'm gonna keep my baby." The great one...
We're dead!  They showed this prison movie to my youth group on Sunday.
Hold on...
Uh...Yeah, Grandma.  She doesn't mean that.  Kinda lost the old filter with her last stroke.
I'm only allowed "G" movies.
All of you!
They could kill you.
...and sex dreams where you actually have an orgasm!
I'm terribly sorry, Mr. de Mille.
I can tell her you're all tied up in the projection room.  I can give her the brush ...
You'll pardon me, Norma? Why don't you just sit and watch?  O.K.  Here we go.
I almost reported you to the Bureau of Missing Persons.  Fans, you all know Joe Gillis, the well-known screen writer, opium smuggler and Black Dahlia suspect.
That was the general idea.
I'll have the bell-hop take care of your luggage.
Goodbye, Mr. Gillis.
That was last year.  This year I'm trying to earn a living.
What for? To recover that knife you stuck in my back?
The flashback in the courtroom, when she tells about being a school teacher.
Is that so? What's the wonderful news?
You did?
Where's the story? I bluffed it out with a few notions of my own. It's really just a springboard. It needs work.
You sure have.
It must be my new shampoo.
That's it -- there's nothing like being twenty-two.  Now may I suggest that if we're ever to finish this story you keep at least two feet away from me ...  Now back to the typewriter.
Was I?  I'm sorry.
It's nothing.  I got a telegram from Artie.
Just look around.  There's a lot of her spread about.  If you don't remember the face, you must have heard the name of Norma Desmond.
Jealous.  Ever see so much junk? She had the ceiling brought from Portugal.  Look at this.
Come on, Joe.
What assistant?
Gordon Cole?
We've missed you too, dear.
Sure.  Wait a minute -- haven't I seen you -- ?
I am big.  It's the pictures that got small.
That's where the popcorn business comes in.  You buy yourself a bag and plug up your ears.
Don't get sore at me.  I'm not an executive.  I'm just a writer.
Uh-huh.
I'll come early tomorrow.
Look, I'm supposed to fix up your script.  There's nothing in the deal about my staying here.
They don't?  Then why do they still write me fan letters every day. Why do they beg me for my photo- graphs?  Because they want to see me, me, me!  Norma Desmond.
Okay.
Please.  Now I've forgotten how many spades are out.
Can't you wait till I'm dummy?
Now you're being silly.  We don't need two cars.  We have a car.  And not one of thuse cheap new things made of chromium and spit.  An Isotta-Fraschini.  Have you ever heard of Isotta-Fraschinis?  All hand-made.  Cost me twenty-eight thousand dollars.
Why begrudge me a little fun? I just want you to look nice, my stray little boy.
I don't need a tuxedo.
I don't like those studs they've sent.  I want you to have pearls. Nice big pearls.
Careful, it's slippery.  I had it waxed.
The other guests?
There are no other guests.  We don't want to share this night with other people.  This is for you and me.
Keep it.
Has it ever occurred that I may have a life of my own? That there may be some girl I'm crazy about?
It sure would have made attractive headlines: Great Star Kills Her- self for Unknown Writer.
I'm not just selling the script. I'm selling me.  DeMille always said I was his greatest star.
When did he say it, Norma?
I ran into some people I knew.
Thank you, darling.
Of course you haven't.  I wouldn't let you.
Yes, I am, Norma.
And I'd take it in a second, Norma -- only it's a little too dressy for sitting behind the copy desk in Dayton, Ohio.
Norma, you'd be throwing it away. I don't qualify for the job, not any more.
She was the greatest.  You wouldn't know.  You are too young.  In one week she got seventeen thousand fan letters.  Men would bribe her mani- curist to get clippings from her fingernails.  There was a Maharajah who came all the way from Hyderabad to get one of her stockings.  Later, he strangled himself with it.
They found your car in the garage.  They are going to tow it away.
What?
You don't believe me?  Look in the garage.
Frankly, no.
There's nothing, Gillis.  Not even if you were a relative.
Did you hate him?  Had you ever thought of doing something like this before?
Paramount is calling.
It is not Mr. deMille in person. It is someone by the name or Gordon Cole.  He says it's very important.
It's big. And empty. I'm tired of limiting myself to  Argo City. I want to do something new. I'm starting to repeat myself here with this airy, glittery stuff....
But what will happen?
I've been saving it. For the right moment.
Later.
I'll be safe with you. We can stay together the rest of our lives.
Why not ?
Just give me a chance to show how much I love you. Love changes everything. Love makes everything possib1e.
You're not afraid are you?
But why?
Hello. Are you still mad at me?
I'm not mad at you.
I don't see why not.
Oh, you know how parties are. Always some damage.
But she is real, it wasn't just a concussion.
Call me next week. Maybe we can have lunch.
Remember? I was trying desperately to get you're attention.
But Kara, no one has ever gone from here to Earth. The journey is dangerous.
I allowed it to escape the City.
Why haven't you been able to contact him? He should have returned from the neutron galaxy ages ago. He may be dead. ZOR-EL But what can you, a mere girl-
Didn't you study six-dimensional geometry in school?
No sweat. When's the rest of your stuff arriving?
Oh, I don't know. I'm not signed out for an overnight.
He's nice.
Cigarette?
You're wasting your breath.
Such a shame. You ought to take better care of yourself.
Maybe you'd like to get rid of this Supergirl yourself, Nigel?
It's the most beautiful place in the universe.
Are you happy, Zaltar?
No, it's no good---you can't practice--- you only get one go. A thing like that. No. Sure you don't want a sip of this? It's delicious, I think.
Not doing this for you. Just sick of this place, that's all. Wretched singing sculptures, always yowling at you. Boring!
Don't stop. Keep moving.
What? What did you tell me?
For reminding me, I mean. Can you follow me?
I didn't --
I mean him.
You know, I was just thinking, Lana --  -- someone like you could do do really well in Metropolis --
Call me.
Anyday...
I'd better be. Suddenly I've got competition to keep up with.  Your high school reunion article. I though it was terrific. And fascinating.  Especially about the girl back home.  I'll tell you what, Clark, I'll take you to lunch and you can tell me all about it.
I wouldn't know Mr. Kent. Most of the people I went to high school with are still in high school.
What kind?
Not counting this week.  You secured employment last June as a messenger and were discharged after one day for. . .
Mr. Gorman, the city of Metropolis is generous to a fault, but. . .
You are, I was about to say, no longer eligible.

Say who?
Yeah? What do you do with 'em?
Columbia's got two major exports and one of them's coffee. 
Yeah, yeah, I can do it.
Wait a second. Astronomers know where the planet used to be, right? And you know what happens when a planet explodes? Debris. Pieces floating in space.
Gus, if there's anything I hate, it's greed.
Anything.
Gus, it seems we are talking state-of-the-art technology here. We are talking unlimited power. We are talking "get-down hot-cha daddy-o" whatever you called it.
Man, all it got to do is find their weak spot.  You bet on the machine in any fight you name, you gonna win your bet.
No, we're just going down.
Her name's Lorelei Ambrosia. She's Webster's Girl Friday.
Thank ...you.
You just did, with that great dinner.
The bridge...?  I'd better get going!
Okay, what is it? You want a ride?
Hey, I know a lot of things!
Why do I have to do this?
Gus Gorman, this is my Psychic Nutritionist.
We already have a super-tanker.
The planet Superman came from. Krypton.
Who needs Gus?
So far the hostages are unharmed.
Oh, you're a great writer, Lois, nobody doubts that.
Superman? Oh, was he here?
And you weren't. As usual. What do you say to that?
I guess it would be all right if -  Lois, now that you know me, I think you ought to know it all.
Your place?  Maybe I should change,  Maybe you should, too.
I'm sorry.
What else could I do?
The minute the story broke I bundled her on the first Concord out of here. If Paris goes kablooey I want the best reporter I've got right there in the middle of it.
How would you like to take a little vacation? I mean you've earned it, you know? You deserve it.
North!
He knows where the Eiffel Tower is, Olsen.  You do, don't you, Kent?
Superman's got something up his sleeve, that's for sure. We just haven't figured it out. Isn't that right, Miss Lane?
But you had more than that, and I know it. You and my father --  you had each other.  Can I never have what you had?
My kind of people.
I didn't ask her anything . . .
That little black box, Mr. Luthor, I mean -- what's it for?
He has powers as we do . . .
I'll have to take the chance. Try to get them all into that molecule chamber. It takes away their powers, reduces them to human beings. Now if you could . . .
Are you kidding? I knew it all the time. Did you see how they fell into our trap? Beautiful . . .
You'll find out, General! And when you do . . .
Come to me, Superman! If you dare! I defy you! Come! Come, and kneel before Zod!
Yes?
But they're expecting us. It wouldn't be polite.
Let's sit down. They walk to the table. LOIS calls out to the balcony.
No mind, it's only antique Irish linen.
Lacy. . . I . . .
It's her father's grey matter that's weakened if you ask me. How can I ask Superman such a dumb question.
But you can't tell where one country begins and another ends. You can't see any borders. It's just . . . one world.
Don't be over-dramatic, young lady. What kind of disaster could we help bring about?
He has all of Superman's powers. If I've planned it right. . .
Didn't you see it? He lifted me up and crashed me down.
Hmm . . . Nuclear levitation. Now that's a trick that could come in handy.
What? A genius? . . . an inspiration?
I made you, and I can destroy you.
Me? Now? With Superman dead and you on my team? It's like I'm the coach and you're the best power forward ever. What could I have to fear?
It's common knowledge you hate children and animals. Why are you back in Metropolis?
Which explains why you sent his organic matter to the sun.
A mind is a terrible thing to waste, Lex Luthor. And you've wasted yours on this foul monstrosity. I'm taking you in.
No . . . it's the way it always is . . . on the brink . . . with good fighting evil.
Bunkers!
He's thirty-five years old.
--  thought about a rocket that carries a nuclear warhead in its nosecone and can strike with an impact of  --
Not you.  You.  Tell me again.
You and Lois, you get all the action.  There she is, out in the wild West and everything.
What's she doing in California?
No, Mom. You know I wouldn't break my promise.
Anyway, we Kent's don't like showoffs, ain't that so? A body's got to be humble even if he knows that he's better'n his neighbors.
North. It's north
No.
But otherwise it's swell.
Not in Metropolis it isn't. This is the home of the sneak attack, the stab in the back, the --
Not unless you can fly.
It wasn't a trick!
The way you describe him doesn't really do him justice.
First the pets, Otis.
Stay and listen!  Besides, it's twelve in the afternoon. This is no time to go to bed.
Baby -- I'm going to take you higher.
What are you going to do to him?
You got wax in your ears?
Then -
Folks'll ask question.
He'll be weightless.
Well, physiologically, he...	won't quite fit.
Enjoyed it?
It does, huh?  Clark Kent, I'd like you to meet Lois Lane.
There's been a lot of confusion in the media about who I am and what I'm up to and all that. I'd like to set the record straight. With your help.
Unlisted number, Shall we proceed?
What about it?
Did I do good, Mr. Luthor?
It's a Twinkie, boss.
Makes Cecil B. DeMille look like the Senior Class play, right?
Sure. It's the joining together of two land masses pushed together eight million years ago. The fault line itself is unstable and always shifting, which is the reason you get earthquakes in the California area from time to time.
Maybe I should get help.
It wouldn't hurt. You can't go on living in fantasies. Did you really think you could get hold of a nuclear bomb? And drop it?  Why, our Strategic Defense boys would have  --
You guessed it!  You're always one step ahead of me.  Aren't you Superman?  Yes, right. There was a police helicopter buzzing the area and transmitting on the same frequency as the garage doors. The minute the signal went out --  Zip!  Zip!  Zip!
We're...not together.
Are you still in touch?
Yes.  Do you find there's something strange about this meat?
Mitchell.  It was nice to see you again, Ally.
I will.
I understand.
Why are you telling me this?
Nicole, I'm just going to pack all this stuff and give it to the church for charity.  Don't feel bad. Unless you feel strange about wearing it.
Well, Sam, I might as well tell you the truth.  It's this lawsuit you've gotten yourself all involved with. I want you to drop the damned thing.
It does concern me.
Well, I don't know why it should. There's a whole lot of people in town involved with lawsuits.  We're hardly unique here, Billy.  I mean, I can understand how you feel.
It's not enough.  For hospital bills.  For Nicole.
A while.
Billy, do you have to smoke? Wendell can smell if someone's been smoking.
Well, maybe that's because they know I'm going to follow them.  Behind the bus.
Risa, I serviced that bus.  At the garage.  There's nothing wrong with it.
Yes.
Yes.  What do you mean by 'hippies'?
From what?
Were his parents...attentive to him?
You hate it.
I could wrap it up.  Protect the other kids.
The Ottos always waited for the bus with Bear.  They were the only parents who did that, together like that.  I guess they're what you might call hippies.
And winter?
Oh.
So he was mean?
Okay.
I won't lie.
Unless the report from the National Weather Bureau for the district on January 23 goes into the record, I will object to that question.
Was the bus on time?
Did there come a time when the bus turned off Staples Mill Road onto
And what was the weather like at this time?
When?
People who will help our cause.
Thanks.
Tell me your news, Zoe.
No.  But this is.  They wouldn't take my blood.
I love you, Zoe.  I'll be there soon, and I'll take care of you.  No matter what happens.  I'll take care of you.
No.
Yes.
As I'm talking, I'm remembering more about it.
There was a brown dog that ran across the road up there, right by the dump, and Dolores slowed down not to hit him, and he ran into the woods.  And then Dolores drove on and turned onto the Marlowe road, as usual.  I remember that.  I'm remembering it pretty clearly.
Why were you scared?
Yes.  I looked.  I remember clearly now.  It seemed we were going too fast down the hill.  I was scared.
Really?
Does it fit?
The ramp?
Well, yes.  He's your lawyer too.
What about insurance?  Doesn't insurance pay for these things?
How about Sunday night?  That's always the best time.
She'll move away.
Your nephew doesn't want a drink.
Four five nights ago.  That's how I know the romance is off.  Also Steve's in a very bad mood.
Hurry back.
Is it news to you?
Just exactly what are you so hot about?  I mean, I know it's a difficult thing to be an artist in this crudest of possible worlds, but --
I'm trying to get Susie to stand up to you.  But your manner is so threatening that she's afraid to speak!
History repeats itself.  Everything that happened to Alan Leslie...began with a smear like this...
But that wasn't your fault, dear, what happened to Leslie.  I've told you that a million times...
I wouldn't have called the boy exactly balanced...
Let me finish, dear.  You had your say, now let me have mine...
I'm a schoolboy - teach me, teach me.
Tonight.  Before you go to bed. The cat is in the bag and the bag is in the river.
J.J., you said you want to help me - prove it!
Get Steve back his job...please...
He means that much to you...?
A pocket fulla firecrackers - looking for a match!  It's a new wrinkle to tell the truth... I never thought I'd make a killing on some guy's "integrity".
But not for anything I did today...
You're incapable of the truth...
Well, I'll be darned.  And what does J.J. think he SHOULD do?
Go out with DIFFERENT girls!
No.  That's what I mean - I'm being fired for what I didn't do.
Yeah.  Otis Elwell.  The columnist.
So take five minutes!  Get acquainted!  He's an important man - he's lonely - don't be dumb!
But...
But what?
It won't leave much of a balance in the bank...  Mr. Robard?  Could you locate him?
It is a favor, isn't it?
Don't you think it's about time you shut yours?  Who are you to tell a man like Frank D'Angelo to shut up?!
See me in my office.
Frankly, yes, to my surprise.  He thinks he's very gifted - those boys'll go a big mile, he thinks.
I'm telling him in the morning after breakfast.
Why did you call me?
Well, maybe I was wrong, too... But there's no doubt, Susie, that we have to face some serious things...
But, please, Steve, please - one step at a time!  I was born only yesterday!...
They have it in a vault at Cyberdyne...  It's gotta be from the other one like you.
No one must follow your work.
My mission is to protect you.
I would.
TERMINATED!?  Shit!  Why didn't you tell me? We gotta right now!
You told me to.
What?
Chill out, dickwad.
That's great!  See, you're getting it.
You will.
You mean people?  I don't know.  We just cry. You know.  When it hurts.
No.
I guess, yeah --  Oh shit!!
I don't care.  We've gotta stop her.
What?
Look, Mom, if I'm supposed to ever be this great leader, you should start listening to my leadership ideas once in a while.  'Cause if you won't, nobody else will.
Don't quit, Sarah.  Our son need you.
And what it that?
And Skynet fights back.
I want to know everything.  What he looks like. Where he lives.  Everything.
On August 29th 1997 it's going to feel pretty fucking real to you, too!  Anybody not wearing number two million sunblock in gonna have a real bad day, get it?
Respect your elders and your betters!
And talking is talking! Well, I think we better get on.
When he met Hitler at his birthday and shook hands with him, was he pleased?
Some.
Why not show Dr. Furtwngler the evidence. It may refresh his memory?
Major, this is deeply offensive and repugnant!
My manner? Why don't you go downstairs, get a cup of coffee and calm down? What's the matter, Emmi? What's going on with you? What's wrong?
David, I don't understand a thing about you. You're a Jew. Are you a Jew?
I'm sorry. Museum? Not... I said orchestra. Sorry. Believe me.  Help me, Steve. You say you answer for someone from high up. I, too, have orders from high up. Very high up. We want Furtwngler. I'll give you in return the whole orchestra, four, five conductors. I need him, Steve.
Yes.
Yes. She suffered longer. She was in Ravensbruck.
No. Ours was damaged.
What's in those files?
Come in, Emmi, this is your office, too. Emmi, this is Lieutenant David Wills.
Put it on ready to play, and I'll tell you when to play it.
Goebbels and Goering were sure heaping honours on you. One makes you a Privy Councillor, the other makes you Vice-President of the Chamber of Music, and you weren't even a member of the Party, how do you explain that?
How come?
Sure.
You didn't complain about the racial policies, just about the musical standards, is that right?
They were Jews, they had to leave. They were right to leave.  I could not leave my country in her deepest misery. After all, I am a German.  I... I stayed in my homeland. Is that my sin in your eyes?
I was warned.
I wish to say something.
'Happy birthday, dear Adolf, love Wilhelm.' Or words to that effect. That sounds to me like you were dropping on your knees and saying, 'Okay, Adolf, you win. You're the number one man. Have a swell party.'
You know something? You should've written our insurance policies for us because you got more exclusion clauses than Double Indemnity. What do you imagine people thought? The Berlin Philharmonic's taken over by Doctor Goebbels and his Propaganda Ministry but Wilhelm is a freelance, so art and politics are now entirely separate? Is that what you believed ordinary people thought?
No!
And what did he say?
Well, I'm just beginning to develop my theme. Isn't that what you call it in classical music, developing your theme? Okay, so they played on your insecurity. That's human, understandable. But, there is one guy who doesn't like little K as much as he likes you - yeah, the number one man your old pal, Adolf. He thinks you're the greatest, and when he says, I want Wilhelm for my birthday, boy, they better go out get Wilhelm. So, Josef calls and threatens you with little K. And you said to hell with the Ninth in Vienna, I'll give it to Adolf as a birthday present in Berlin. That's the trick they played, they got you by the balls and they squeezed. Hard. Why did you stay? Why did you play for them? Why were you the flag-carrier for their regime?  Jealousy?
Of course there was a conspiracy against me, a campaign - even abroad.
I said I have illegitimate children. I don't know how many.
I absolutely refused the house and the bomb shelter.
No, that's your problem, Wilhelm. You understand nothing. We'll call you. Go!
Speaking to Party members I used their language, of course I did, everyone did.
Do I know Hans Hinkel?
Show you?
All in the cause of humanity, Helmuth. Or should I call you one- zero-four-nine-three-three-one?
One-zero-four-nine-three-three- one. Or d'you mind if I just call you 'one'?
Was looking at Furtwngler like that?
Nope.
Do you know who Arturo Toscanini is?
Like this bandleader.
Hey, hey, slow up, Fraulein Straube has to take down what you say.
It was Beethoven's Ninth.
The pay's the same but you'll make more in tips.
Alright!

We will, kiddo.
Listen.  Understand.  That Terminator is out there.  It can't be reasoned with, it can't be bargained with...it doesn't feel pity of remorse or fear... and it absolutely will not stop. Ever.  Until you are dead.
What?
Stop!  I don't want to know. Hold still.  So...it was John that ordered you here?
It was an honor.  A chance to meet the legend.  Sarah Connor.  Who taught her son to fight...organize, prepare. From when he was a kid.  When you were in hiding, before the war.
You'll learn.
You like it?  It's my first.
Okay.  Talk some more.
Why?
Yes.  And I don't want to know where you got it.
You're not supposed to.
SKYNET.  A computer defense system built for SAC-NORAD by Cyber Dynamics.  A modified Series 4800.
Why?
Of course.
Lieutenant, are you sure it's them?  Maybe I should see the ...bodies.
They've already been identi- fied.  There's no doubt.
I can't sleep.
Okay.
You gotta be kidding me.  The new guys'll be short-stroking it over this one.  A one-day pattern killer.
I hate the weird ones.
Call her again.
Suspect westbound on Olympic.  Grey sedan.  Has hostage, repeat...
But, the expectation was ten.  And, in this case, expectation is everything.
Did you?  Kudos.
Oh, no... you.
Don't just stand there, get help!
What <u>is</u> your problem?
I don't understand why they're getting you involved.
It was a gift... from my brother.
You pull me up.
That tall, bright building.  Near there.
Don't.  It was a shitty job anyway. I overreacted.
You?
What's wrong?
How?  How could they have gotten anything?
Nicholas, okay... you're not about to shoot anyone...
Get us out!
... what... ?
That gun.  That... that's not automatic.  The guard had an automatic...
Where'd you get that gun?
We searched the house.
Guess you missed it.
What are you doing?
Fuck you.
That's not true...
Always.
Happy Birthday, man.
Will you?
I know...
You think I know?  I paid them <u>more</u> to make it stop.
Stop this.  It's not true...
Stop it!
Yeah.
Yes.
Of course you can have it if you need it.  Can I get you something to eat?
Yes.
You mean, I don't like it, he doesn't pay?
I don't want money.  I'm pulling back the curtain.  I'm here to meet the wizard.
I told you, they hired me over the phone.  I never met anyone.
They were my husband's.  My late husband... may he rest in peace.
Fine.
No, thank you.  Goodnight.
Is Alan Baer "the Game?"  Is that what this is?
Wanted to wish you luck.  Not that you'll need it.
Nothing else?
What?
I thought it best to be isolated, to be in a location with a definite sense of history, and I wanted to make sure that it wasn't so pleasant you'd all sleep too easily.  You'll be taking a variety of tests, none of them harmful, and you've got the house, the grounds, and each other to keep you company.
Yeah.
Do we still get paid for the week?
That smell... oh, God.
Sure.
It doesn't matter.  Even if they're tormenting me, someone wants me.  What I do with this is up to me.  I can be a victim, or I can be a volunteer.  And I want to be the volunteer.
Then who called me?
Are you Mister Dudley, the caretaker?
Who?
Why'd she kill herself?
So far.
Why would we --
This?  It's from a thrift shop.
David.
Why?
I don't know.  You've been alone for a long time, maybe you want attention.  Maybe he did it...
I'm trying.  Have you ever kept something to yourself because you were afraid it'd ruin things.
I'm not into finger foods.  Too fussy.
Oh, god.
Who?
I'm a gracious host.
We can't find ...  ... two of our guys.
This is un-fucking professional.
No, Terry.  They don't work like that. Jenny Wilson's father paid a little visit, left a message.
What did you tell them.
You think I'm staying?
Huh?
Yeah?
Close Quarters Combat.  Keep one in my own home.
Round about, yeah.
Valentine.  What's he got to say for himself?
She didn't know what to say.  I thought someone should say something. To someone.  With me it was, I don't know -- Jenny liked me for some reason.  I felt like I owed her.
Not me, man.  I'm no drug dealer, what you think.
I already told you, man.  Corcoran.  Know what that is?  State prison.
These are not guys you can just go run a number on, man.
He's brought in the heavy mob.
Extra muscle.  Bodyguards.
That would be too easy.
Same.
Here, are you always this sarky?
Oh, it just ended, then.
Now who's being sarcastic?
When you've lost as many years as I have, love, puts things in perspective, know what I mean.
How'd you manage that, then.
In Jenny?  'Course not.  How could I be. 'Course I wasn't.
I gave him yours.  Said, here, you want to write, I think this is a relative.  I guess I thought I was being true to Jenny.  Who told me she didn't have a father -- before proceeding of course to tell me why.
Now, you shouldn't run yourself down.  My employer, Mr. Lindgren --
Who's Mr. Lindgren?
Well, not to say Mr. Lindgren is dishonest, exactly.
This and that.  Y'know.  Ways and means.
Why not.
Still, there have been rewards.  It's sunny.  And some of the producers who call even have credits.
Honest.  Didn't know where to look till I was 21.
You ever been to London?
I've got the hang of the driving.  Found this place all right.
Well, she twigged by the time she was eight or nine that daddy wasn't in the Royal Marines or doing scientific research in the jungles of Borneo or playing Iago in a worldwide tour of OTHELLO.
How far?
I don't know -- few hours, I guess.
Look, mush, you're the guv'nor here, I can see that, I'm on your manor now, right.  So there's no need to get out of your pram.  I'm Johnny-come-lately to all this.  Whatever the bollocks between you and this slag Valentine, it's got nothing to do with me.  I don't wanna know.
What am I doing?
No kidding.
Nine years?  Is that legal?
The ones whose burden you took upon your own shoulders.
While they're all fucking each other over ... couple of parties like us could move right in.
Sure you do.
Is he here?
Hello, Birdy. I thought that was very good.
Hello, Birdy.
Pop doesn't like people smoking in here.
That's what he keeps telling me.
Geez, Mr Crane.
Look, I'm no expert, but--
Huh.
Huh. Yeah. Maybe...
It's OK...
I don't understand.
Did she make mistakes?
No. I--tell me--
Do? Hell, nothing. Well, you'll want to keep tabs on your investment, of course, but I'm looking for a silent partner. I've done the research, I've contacted the vendors, the deal is set. I'm just looking for venture capital, friend. Disappear if you want, check in whenever you like--I want the dough; I don't take attendance.
And how do we share--
Cash.
No, Dave, I wasn't.
Big Dave--
I'm not proud of what I did. But *you*.
I, uh... thanks.
Honey?
Ahh...
How are you?
Terrific. Your husband backs you up. That's terrific.
I tried to tell him the whole story, but Riedenschneider stopped me. He said the story made his head hurt, and anyway he didn't see any way of using it without putting me on the hot seat for the murder of Big Dave...
He a good man?
I don't work here. My wife does.
Yeah.
Check out the rack on that broad in the angora.
Sorry, I just didn't remember.
My *wife*?
Birdy...
Hello, Walter.
Ah-hah. It would be best if he waited here.
His eyes are open.
He said OK. Is that what he said?
Great.
The cops are non-negotiable, Ippolito.  Why don't you just tell me how this space station works.
You said the system couldn't fail!
I made it outside.  I'll co-ordinate the rescue efforts from here.  Help is on the way.  Just sit tight.
What's left of it.
In this violent world, I believe the only way to stay sane is to take time to notice beautiful things.
I drink.  After hours of course.  On duty, I smoke.  Do you mind?
The thalamus and the hypothalamus, perhaps?
How can you say that?  You know it's not true.
Cuthbert's counting on the exhibition's success.  The museum is in debt.  Contributions and public funding have dried up.  Admissions no longer cover overhead.  The last big infusion of cash we had was the King Tut exhibit.  Cuthbert was hired to get us out of the red.  If the Superstition Exhibit isn't lucrative, he'll have to start auctioning off some of these gems.
They're eggs.
But a virus normally codes for other viruses.  This one's making human and animal proteins.  Listen to this.  "Glycotetraglycine collagenoid. Weinstein's tropic hormone.  4- monoxytocin supressin hormone."
Some kind of power failure.  Maybe it's the storm.  Do you have a flashlight?
Yes.  John made quite a study of the whole museum.  He had a copy of my original plans.
This means there must be an animal loose in the museum!
They were sent to the Center For Disease Control in Atlanta.
Fourth floor, West wing, but stay with your class.
Big as a house.
Not yet.  Let's try the fork to the left.
I'm sorry to be the bearer of bad tidings, but you know me.  Telegraph. Telephone.  Tell Kawakita.  I got the definitive word from Cuthbert's secretary.  This is Dr. Frock's last week.
It's not mammalian, that's for sure. I think it's reptilian.
How about lunch?
If he were alive he'd have contacted me.
You loved him.
No one knows.  The Kothoga who live on the tepui are cannibals.
I don't understand.
I don't know.  He sent back a statue that's supposed to be an exact representation.  But I've never seen it.  It's in the exhibit.
I'm not sure.  We should split up. You take that hall and I'll take this one.
Behind me.  Over there.
I don't know.  Mr. Pendergast.  Do me a favor.  Get me a DNA readout on that claw.
No.  A chromium alloy tipped .45 caliber bullet bounced off that thing's skull like a spit ball.  I think it was bothered by my light.
It's not supernatural.  Mbwun is an animal.  Part lizard, part human, a genetic freak of some kind, like the half-goat, half-sheep they found last year in the jungles of Vietnam.
Then it won't go after the others?
Whatever that thing is, we have to kill it!
Today.
Why wasn't I told?  Any unpredictable behavior has to be reported.  Is that the best shot we can get?
Sweep the harbor.
The catalyst for the recent dramatic events was of course Truman's father, Kirk, and his infiltration onto the show. Before we discuss that, it's worth reminding viewers that this isn't the first time someone from the outside world has tried to reach Truman.
Of course, his eagerness to leave his mother's womb also meant he was the one selected.
People forget it takes the <i>population</i> of an entire country to keep the show running.
Yes, everything you see on the show is for sale - from the actors' wardrobe, food products, to the very homes they live in--
All products carefully chosen and tested by you for quality and aesthetic value.
And it's all available in the "Truman" Show" catalogue.  Operators are standing by.
Now.
Your Dad?!
Yeah...
Really?
This is different.  Everybody seems to be in on it.
Not the whole thing, Truman.  You were right about one thing.
A man tripped and fell on a chainsaw.  We got three of his fingers back on.
--we need more charcoal.
Why do you want to have a child with me? You can't stand me.
I've tasted other cocoas.  This is the best.
Truman, stop it!
--Truman, you're gonna be late!
I've got something to tell you.  You'd better sit down.
I spend half my life out in the sun, Mother, why would I need vitamin D?
I'll try.
Tell her, tell her...I had to go to Fiji. I'll call her when I get there.
Yes.
That the bombing in Dallas may have been to destroy the bodies of those firemen, so their deaths and the reason for them wouldn't have to be explained --
Yes. I know.
Well...where would you like me to start? Antarctica is a long way from Dallas, Agent Scully. I can't very well submit a report to the Attorney General that alleges the links you've made here. Bees and corn crops do not quite fall under the rubric of domestic terrorism.
And if it's unsuccessful?
I'm looking for him.
Selling naked pictures of little kids over his computer.
And one little boy.
I picked up the historical document of the venality and hypocrisy of the American government. The daily newspaper.
I've been using you?!
And why do you think it is you're standing here talking to me? These people don't make mistakes, Agent Mulder.
No. I haven't.
I've just climbed twelve floors. I'm hot and thirsty and I'm wondering, to be honest, what I'm doing here.
I'm in the vending room.
I think you must have an idea. They cited a history of problems relating back to 1993.
Is that before or after you got the idea to come here?
Just get dressed. I'll explain on the way.
And you're looking for?
Mulder --
I need you there with me. I need your expertise on this. The bomb we found was meant to destroy those bodies and whatever they were infected by.
I wasn't planning on it. Particularly after spending a half hour in cold storage this morning. But I got a better look at the blood and tissue samples I took from the firemen.
What did you find?
This is great. This is fitting.
We're not chasing trucks, we're chasing evidence --
After what you saw last night -- after all you've seen -- you can't just walk away --
No -- it's --
You got me. But I think I know what they did with Jimmy Hoffa.
But it's not the lives we saved. It's the lives we didn't.
I breached protocol. I broke contact with the S.A.C. I ignored a primary tactical rule and left him alone with the device.
I don't know.
I have answers for you.
That's why you bombed the building. The infected firemen, the boy --
Driver.
The vaccine you hold is the only defense against the virus. Its introduction into an alien environment may have the power to destroy the delicate plans we've so assiduously protected for the last fifty years.  Or it may not.
No, you need only take away what is most precious to him.
She thinks I can bring Edward back.
It could take years for me to get past the barriers he's created.
I don't want you up all night reading Edward's case file of the nine millionth time.  Balance, dear girl, is the key. Leave the work here.
Four and twenty blackbirds...
You're the shrink, you tell me.
You think you can do this, don't you?
Not Stargher, not really.  He's split himself right down the middle. Good/evil, right/wrong, merciful/cruel. A monster.  And an innocent child.  If I could reach the boy.
Then what is he?
Evil.
So you say.
I need you to find something in the basement...
Stargher is in custody.  The functional equivalent of being under arrest. Normally, we'd Mirandize him, and if he didn't lawyer up, we'd interrogate him. But because of his condition, he doesn't have the capacity to waive those rights.
That's a secret.
Why jeopardize what we've already done? We caught the sonofabitch.  Carl Stargher.  That's going to be like Bundy, Gacy, Dahmer.  A case that makes careers.  But if we push our luck.  If this is all bullshit and we come out smelling like it.
They think you did it.
I was talking to another friend of Harry's. A Baron Kurtz - do you know him?
Mmmm.
I was told there were only two men there.
Why?
Yes. He moved his head, but the rest is good, isn't it?
Need we go through it all again?
Comedy. I don't play tragedy.
"Ein hurigan" - I guess.
Oh, we didn't make much sense. Drank too much. Once he tried...
Oh, it's very difficult. You know Harry...we didn't do...
I don't know.
A parrot...Let it go.
I knew him for twenty years - at least I thought I knew him. I suppose he was laughing at fools like us all the time.
I'll put these flowers in water.
How did you know I would be here?
How do you know?
If you want to sell your service, I'm not willing to be the price... I loved him. You loved him. What good have we done him. Look at yourself, they have names for faces like that.
Thank you.
Keep the packet.
They're Harry's.
What did you say? I'm sorry...
I don't...
Schmolka!
Best thing that ever happened...
Pin it on a...
Calloway.
Oh, stop behaving like a fool, Martins.
I'm only a little fool - I'm an amateur at it - you're a professional. You've been shaking your cap and bells all over town.
Well?...
I haven't got a sensible name, Calloway.
No, no. Leave them for a while.
Oh, Mr. Martins...
Please hurry up - just get him on the telephone.
Yes, Cultural re-education Section Propaganda. Very important in a place like this. We do a little show each week. Last week we did "Hamlet" and the week before we had something...
Excuse me, have you got tooth...
It's good to see you, Holly.
You can help her.
I remember when they raided the gambling joint - you know a safe way out...
English?
Must be some mistake.
What does he say?
I was told that he did not die at once.
You don't know it was an accident. You only saw a dead man and three men carry him.
Suppose I take...
I am not a bad man.
Never.
His name?
I'm waiting on some money coming through. It's just that at the moment, you know, I'm short. They're going to chuck me out. On the street in Bangkok, that's bad.
I don't think so.
I wouldn't know anything about that, sir.
She means your neighbor. The Scotsman
Well what the fuck do you expect me to do about it.
What happened?
Two.
Richard, you know something -
I do; I follow it. But okay, say God provided the ram. So what? Once Abraham raised the knife, in his heart it was as if he'd killed him. He could never forget that. And neither could Isaac. Look at him: he's traumatized, he's a putz for the rest of his life. By the end he can't tell Jacob from Esau....
They sound like you.
The Nazis did everything the fhrer told them. You do everything the Torah tells you. Or the rebbe. Identical slave mentality.
What??
Yeah. He's a respected scholar. Even No-am Chomsky says he --
Fifty's an exaggeration. Anyway, that was a different moment. Things were possible that aren't now.
Actually, I think this moment has possibilities that --
You're a Jew. Maybe you don't realize it, but you are.
The point is, the modern world is a Jewish disease.
I work at the Big Boy warehouse. In Queens. I drive a fork-lift.
Are they still together?
But you can read it, the Hebrew.... Right?
It's silent. It holds a place, takes a vowel. The vowels are little dots that go under the letters.
V'asitem lechem pessel to-monat. And make no graven image of the Lord, or the form of any figure, or of man or woman, or beast or fowl or fish or anything that looks like anything. Because He's not like anything. Not only can't you see Him or hear Him, you can't even think about Him. I mean, what's the difference between that and Him not existing?
Why should I submit?
You think I should just because there's no reason?
Judaism doesn't even need God. You have the Torah, the law. That's your fucking God....  The book's closed.
It's all you talk about. Jewish, Jewish, Jewish. Nobody talks about it that much except the Jews.
Kaddish is the prayer for the dead.
And be crushed.
I'll go look....
What'd you say?
I'm stealing it.
He's Jewish? Manzetti?
I'm sure they are. But what do we accomplish by pointing it out?
I don't know. Is that right?
Female...
You're not listening. He isn't better. He gives pleasure, but that's actually a weakness.
So, fine, it's not that the Jew, the Jews own the media and the banks. It's that they're sexually corrupt.
Differences exist, of course, but they're irrelevant. For the Jew, his Jewishness dominates everything. Even the ones who renounce it, who hate it, who want to cut it out of their hearts a knife...can't escape. They're still just Jews.
To discredit me. Because I know who they are. Look, I thought I explained it to you. Those people can say or do anything. And they will. It's all narrative to them, it's... Are you going to print what this guy said?
It's slander. It's reckless disregard. I'll sue you and your fucking Jew paper.
No.
I can't help what I think.
But I wasn't.
Think about your father. Your sister.
You do it on the inside....
No!
But you already talked about it: you said it's not stupid. Why isn't it stupid?
Why deprive him of his greatest pleasure?
Tell it to Hitler.
Nobody ever beat me up.  Look, Linda, there're fifty reasons. Even if you knew them all, there'd be another fifty you didn't know.
No, it's weird, man. Nobody knows where he went.
They don't. I checked twenty times.... Somebody must have talked.
Mrs. Moebius.
Why? Why would she?
Where?
Wow, that's uh...great...
I was a Jew in a previous life.
"Do chickens give milk?"
And that's when the Mets started to stink.
Danny, please, we don't want to know.
Johana Cross, pleased to meet you.  Well!  Isn't this a coincidence. I really wasn't expecting this... All the way out here.  It's incredible!
Good night Enzo, Good night Jacques.
Five minutes and fifty seconds.
What does that mean?
I didn't say...  Brussels!
No...
Yes, I know.
Then, it's very chic.  Avanti!
Because pasta should be eaten "Al Dente".  So the trinket will just have to wait a bit.
Thank you.
Enzo, don't be angry.  I was lucky... that's all.
Thank you.  I wouldn't want to interrupt anything.
Thank you...
It's me... Johana.
No... tell me.
Absolutely positive.
Uncle Louis.  He's a 75 year old amazing guy, isn't he?
It's nothing.  Just the long trip. I'm a little jet-lagged.
Promise you won't forget me.
... Are you sure?
What?
How was your trip?
He isn't going to breathe.
Then, goodbye.
One last thing Hammer. You take care of yourself. The...
He's...he's very nice.  But Mrs. Carver, the fate of Hanukkah rests solely in his hands. Please, you have to help me.
How is old Chief Bloomenbergensteinenthal? Is he still shtooping every girl he can get his hands on?
Oh!
Mordechai, I love you. I couldn't let you do this alone.
Mom, stop with this already. Of course I love you. You're my mother.
So don't show a picture.
Do what you must.
...I'm not finished yet, mom.
She said to remind you that you're having Shabat dinner by her tomorrow and also to remind you to bring the Manischewitz.
I'll be in my office.
Now this might get a bit technical, but try and stay with me. Using a highly sophisticated connection of other computators, called the Internet, I can access surveillance maps, villian biographical information, and even sports scores with a few simple keystrokes of this electronic typewriter.
But wait, there's more. With a few swift clicks of this hand-computer interface, commonly referred to as a mouse, I can download illicit pornographic material and even send it along to a friend via a cyber postal route known as e-mail.
Well that's good news for us. It means the system is outdated. This should be easy. C'mon.
While I was in Taiwan negotiating the solution to our labor problems, I came across a factory that illegally manufactures the most addictive, Jewish pride weakening substance on the planet. I bought the entire plant.
Oh, that's the beauty of it. These are free samples.
I don't know -
You get your money from your husband.
And my leopard - - maybe he hurt the first girl -- but no more.
No, sir. That girl in the cemetery? My cat didn't kill that girl. I told you cats don't go around looking for trouble. If that cat's alive, it's out in the country hiding under a bush, starving to death.
Where? Where did you find it?
Watch and see, A day or a week - but certainly this month -- you will have money from a man and then-
When you are going to see Pedro, does your heart beat until you tremble?
Yes. So I've noticed. Jerry's noticed - He'll come up with something.
Maybe. For three years I've sung in rats' nests, while Jerry pounded his feet off and his brains out -- trying to get me a real chance. We're due for a little luck!
I know. I know. You've got the talent. I got the breaks.
You know about animals -- their habits -- will it come back?
It doesn't jibe with this  you told me the leopard would go out into the country - it wouldn't stay in the city 
Why?
But it doesn't eat what it kills.
Caged animals are unpredictable. They're like frustrated human beings. I can't answer your question.
Yes.
Charlie likes his leopard.
He'd act normally when he was with other people. It would be a man who suffered remorse and even pity when it was all over.
Couldn't you tell a man like that when you saw him?
You've thought of all this before. You know it isn't the leopard   Don't you?
Why do yo&amp;i accuse me? You don't know what you're doing -- you don't understand -- nobody understands --
I couldn't rest - I couldn't sleep. All I could see was Teresa Delgado's body -- broken --mangled. I saw it day and night.  It was waiting everywhere I turned.
I'm sure if you are as talented as you are charming, Miss Walker, you have nothing to worry about.
Go on foot.
Nothing much -- just that it might not be a cat this time.
Let me get one thing clear. Did Galbraith make a direct accusation?
You think Galbraith found the leopard on the day you went out with the posse.
Listen, Kicks, you'll never guess what I've cooked up this tine...
No. I thought that might be just a little corny. I want you to lead him in on a leash.
Kiki - he won't hurt you. There's nothing to be afraid of.
Don't be soft.
The whole town's in a state, Kiki doors locked, people huddling together like scared sheep nobody on the streets at night 
And not a sign of the leopard?
Yes.
Maybe there ought to be less racket and more us.
It's all right. I'm not hurt.
Kiki, Galbraith said something to me once, -- something you ought to know. We were talking and he said that people were like that ball on the fountain at the hotel --they got pushed around by things bigger than themselves. That's the way it was with us -- and we were too small to see it that way.
Maybe for the same reason that made someone somewhere not consider this a spot to build the Getty Museum...
Ha-ha... Yeah...  What about that road back there, though? It says closed to the public, doesnt it?
You a tourist?
That would be Mrs De Moraes mother, Sir. Mr and Mrs Spitz are here with their daughter.
I dont know. He seems to delight in so much sisterly love, he might become determined.
Can it be that you want your brother found?
Its a snuff movie. Prime paedophile material. Im told it retails at around 4,000.  I see you dont require a definition.
Excuse me?
Who is Friedman?
Im impressed. That information could have cost me 20,000.
Huh! Really? Hotels?
Yeah. Goodnight, Mrs De Moraes.
Youre repeating yourself, Mrs De Moraes.
You... You are out of order, Mr Lombard. I...
You what, Mrs De Moraes? YOU WHAT?
I take it you learnt to live with yours then. Take it all the mind-dulling pills in your medicine cabinet are surplus to your well-being...
Leon didnt hang himself, Deborah. Your husband killed him and made his death look like suicide. How did he do it, eh? Strangulation? Drugs? No doubt an autopsy will tell.
I dont.
Maybe I wanted to give my husband a fright.
I didnt know who or what had happened to my brother yet, Mr Lombard!
On... Once...  Once... What are we... you going to do?
I dont know. Everyones dead...
Not in America, sir. You must be from Europe.  So, black coffee and a couple of crescents.
I dont smoke. If you could get to the point...
You...  Jesus Christ!
Did you not enter this country illegally?
Look! Either you talk or the creeps are gonna walk. For gods sake. What am I supposed to say? I got this from a French guy from England who broke in there to have a chat with an Austrian child trafficker? Is that it?
I can... The question is, can you lie to your ex- husband?
Have we done business before?
I saw the ad at Georges.  Im passing through town and Im in a hurry.
Where is the Austrian? Is Friedman the Austrian?
Where is he?
What?
Where are we?
And who does Friedman work for?
I dont know. I dont know, man. I dont even know Friedman that well... I...  Man, youve got to get me out of here...
Where is it?
Can I have the reception desk, please.
Should I?
I dont know. How many famous French film directors can there be?
Its Friday night, Jane. What happened to your latest boyfriend?
You may not. And besides, it is irrelevant.
You wouldnt be here if I knew, Mr Lombard. What I do know is that he has not been at work for three weeks. That enquiries to the police and London hospitals have borne no results. And that a check with his bank revealed he has not used his account for four weeks now.
Check with your sons bank. Banks dont usually give out information about their customers.
I presume you checked your sons apartment...
Ha... No, Mr Lombard. His monthly allowance is all he is to expect from us. He knows it and we feel the amount is more than adequate.
Jah...
Does it matter?
Uh-huh. You couldve waited for me inside.
Clients come and go.
Huh, I doubt it...  Friedman only deals directly with select customers. I handle the rabble...
Im overcome by your public-spiritedness.
Boys like the one you met today are surplus. Commodities worth a handful of notes in whatever arsehole of the world they happen to be born into. We improve some lives buying them where theyre not wanted, improve still more selling them where they are. Is that too hard for you?
What are you talking about?
The person who put us in touch seems to think so.
An Austrian.
Questions can amount to revelations. Now, Id hate to think I was made to come here carrying a substantial amount of money in order to be subjected to a cross- examination. Mr Friedman led me to believe we had a deal. Do we?
No. Thank you. Could you tell me if Leon Spitz is here, please?
Yes. You wouldnt know where I could reach him? We had to discuss an exhibition of his photographs at my Paris gallery, you see? I really need to see him before I leave.
Thats what he said. I tried to dissuade him... Told him I couldnt take on another child, that hed get into trouble... I mean, people who sell children... But he wasnt listening... I guess he finally found himself a crusade... His family think hes back on drugs, eh?  Huh... Leon did drugs. A lot of drugs. Went through his self-destruct phase, you know?  Things to come to terms with. Demons to fight... Some peoples minds are gloriously uncomplicated. Not Leons. He did beat the drug, though. He did.
Is she on the phone?
No...
Id appreciate it if I could use your phone.
Huh... I suppose the idea of a one day trip to Los Angeles doesnt appeal to you...
Small, blond, good-looking. She was with him when we met. She had a funny English accent.
Would you know where I might reach her?
Tu sais o me trouver.
O est pass ton salon?
Mon bureau cotait trop cher.
Le montage, lemballage. Not your regular street muck, is it? This is collectors stuff. How much would it cost me?
What sums?
Thats what he said...
Shut up and walk...
Their last suspected kill occurred two years back, though your Spitzes now probably do no more than bankroll the group. Still, Id watch my step. These people are well-connected, Laurent; former Israeli prime minister, etc. The ladys also president of an international Zionist organisation... Anyway, you get the picture.
What do you mean?
Of course I am, it's just that...
So... pretend it's not a game.
We have to do something before she tries it again!  I beg of you, my lord, don't let her down... let me organize an escape...
Do you think I could have some water?
Now?
I thought you were an archer?
There's nothing to hear -- I haven't done anything.  And why haven't I done anything?  Because none of you will listen to me!!
Uh... they said... they will think about it.
Jeanne, you've been badly wounded...
He said that... he's making a treaty with the Duke of Burgundy and...
I don't know, but you're all men of the church... why not ask Him yourself?
No... I said "Surrender in the name of the King of France"...
That is not what is written in the evidence... look for yourself!
Are you saying that if you had not been carrying your banner you'd have killed more people?
... so you were in the middle of the battlefield, with your sword in your hand, waving it above your head... charging against the enemy, screaming and yelling... fighting for your life... and you want us to believe that in the middle of all this excitement you never killed anyone?
No, I... I never killed anyone!
Thirty years ago?  I'm not surprised it's gone...
Well find some other way!  Be creative.  Tell them she fucks the devil... Hmm, not a bad idea... why can't you say that?  Sounds good to me... and who can prove she doesn't?
Am I... am I dead?
Dead you're worthless, darling.
Yes.  In the church at Domremy.
Did it give you advice?  Good advice?
So it is the Church Militant that refuses to confess me, and so prevents me from being a good Christian?
You have nothing to regret...
This word is -- regrettably appropriate for the situation.  In fact what we -- the Church -- wish to do is determine whether or not this girl is sent by God, as she claims.  You understand that we cannot allow just anybody to abuse God's name in this manner...
Who better than a messenger from God to give answers to your questions?
Then her faith will have to be bigger.
... and my crown doesn't fit and...  Really??
Now hold on -- you're not captain here... on the battlefield perhaps, but not in the royal bedchamber!
Why did you betray me?  Paris was ours for the taking!  All I needed was another few hundred men... Why did you take back the army you gave me?
I can see her if I want to.  I mean, with half of France in the hands of the English, what have I got to lose?
... as always, majesty...
His face.
But if the devil were to take on the physical appearance of a saint or an angel... or a man... how would you recognize him?  By what he said?
Go on to the next question.
It is all his majesty can afford. He has even donated his very own personal savings.  His majesty will greatly appreciate a gesture of good will in this delicate negotiation between our two families.
I know... but the English want her very badly, and I have to tell you that they are proving much more generous.
20,000 gold crowns.
Because... because -- I mean -- the English have a broad sense of humor, but... I mean, you don't understand... to them you're a witch, working for the devil.  What makes you think they'll listen to you?
You may have been with your counsel, but I've been with mine, and I'm telling you, God's counsel is wiser than yours, and he's telling me to speak to the English -- now!
Not yet.
The English won't wait.
The Dauphin -- he's sending us food -- and supplies -- and an army -- led by Jeanne -- the maiden from Lorraine -- isn't it wonderful?!
Me too...
Yes.  We can pray.
Perfectly.
But my voices... they promised me...
I had been sold to the English.  I'd rather die than fall into their hands.
Nothing... just taking his teeth.
Then, Lord Dunois, show me the way to the other side of the river...
God knows, but it was a bad idea!
As much as for a Lord?  What an honor!  Did your king give you other wealth apart from horses?
And you look pretty wealthy for a servant of God, wouldn't you say?
I don't know... please... tell me I'm dead...
I... don't know... what do you want from me?
What do you mean, they won't come?
Because!  Because I've always been faithful to God, and I've followed everything he said... and I've done everything he asked me...
You mean God said, "I need you, Jeanne?"
What signs?
Is he the one who spread all this blood and misery?
No, but... why didn't he stop it? Or did he get pleasure, watching us killing each other in his name?
No, I do not think so.  I don't think that killing each other will ever bring peace.
Ah, pleasure... that's a difficult word to define.  When does the pain end and the pleasure begin...? When did your pleasure begin with that sword in your hand...?
... to love your enemy as much as you love yourself?
Oh yes, my sister's just... she's... wonderful.
Jeanne... calm down...!  Calm down, Jeanne!
Wladek, please.
You'll have to stay here until tomorrow afternoon.
Here.
That's your decision.  But when they storm the flat, throw yourself out of die window - don't let them get you alive. I have poison on me, they won't get me alive either!
Oh, you need me now, yes, now you need me!
Just one. Dostoevsky. The Idiot. Three zlotys.
That's better than yesterday.
What are you talking about, my tie? What's my tie got to do with anything? I need the tie for my work.
It's nothing to do with you. It's me they wanted, not you. Why do you interfere in other people's business?
You're mad, that's your trouble, you're mad.
That's also my business.
Toilets?
You've heard the rumours they're going to resettle us in the East?
Bitch!
I know. But last summer, I worked for a day in Zelazna Brama Square. I saw someone I knew. A singer. Her husband's an actor. They're old friends.  I've written their names down. And their address. If they're still there. Janina Godlewska and Andrzej Bogucki. Good people. Majorek, you go into the town every day. Would you try and make contact? Ask them if they'd help me get out of here?
God forbid!
The Russians. On the other side of the river.  All you have to do is hang on for a few more weeks.
Not yet.
Don't thank me. Thank God. It's His will that we should survive. Well. That's what we have to believe.
Ohh the tag is broken.
The Alps.
No, no bible readers.
Yes, I thought that.
Nothing just yet
No.
And what does this do to our bargain? I cannot afford the piano if you mean me to pay.
It was more to your wife that I gave it.
A piano?
Yes and so do I, but there are too few of us here to carry it. TOO - HEAVY
She says it's her piano, and she won't have him touch it. He's an oaf, he can't read, he's ignorant.
Do I know any gigs?
That's right.
Who told ya this guy was in here?
You just sit tight, old man.  We're gonna have to get you to a doctor.  I'll call a cop.
What do we do?
Good, have 'em down at Stenner's old Pool Hall before 3:00.  We're gonna run through the route tonight.
I think it's the best...
And I'm tellin' ya now, you're a fool if you don't get into it.  A bigger fool than I was.  I been lookin' for this one all my life, Johnny.  Now I got a chance to step out at the top.
You'll take a cut of what I make, won't ya?
Then why ain't he dead?
He was a tear-off rat.  He got what he deserved.  No sense helpin' pay his bills.
Which way did he do, Eirie?
The bastard.  He can blow his nose all the way.
I like griftin'.
I don't look any good in clothes and I don't know how to drive. What else ya got to sell, Eirie?
I did.  That stuff I gave him was counterfeit.  They'll pinch him the first place he tries to spend it.
You sure he didn't just pocket it?
I don't know.  Could be.  We're runnin' that down now.
They're still looking for him.
What do ya want the others to get?
You mean you blew it.
We'll get by without 'em.
Then you'll do it?
You can't play your friends like marks, Hooker.
Just a little nervous, that's all.
How many guys you conned in your life, Henry?
I appreciate your stickin' your neck out.  I wouldn't have asked ya if it weren't for Luther.
If we're lucky, this'll bring him back stronger than ever.
Pass.
What are the odds on Syphon?
How do I know you're tellin' the truth.
We'll get 'em!  Give us a chance. I'm not the only agent in here, ya know.  We go around advertising ourselves, how many counterfeiters do you think we'd catch, huh?  You think I'm wearin' this rag here 'cause I like it?  Christ, everybody thinks life's a holiday or somethin' when you got a badge.  I been here since three this morning, Charlie, and I never knew there was so much ugliness in people.  You try to help 'em and they spit on you.  I shoulda let ya go and gotten yourself arrested for passin' false notes.
Where you goin'?
Look, I don't have time to fuck around.  There's somebody out there I don't need to see.  You got a fire escape or anything?
Yeh, this time anyway.
What do you mean?
Maybe a couple million.
This is just a test.  The big one comes later.  Be careful with that though, it's all I got.
'Cause it's better to do it all at once.  We're puttin' down 400 grand next week.  At 5-1 we make 2 million. Twenty per cent of that is yours if ya stick with us.
What is this?  That's my money. You tryin' to muscle me?
No.
I'll make parole.
Hell yes.  We don't care about the mark.  He deserves what he gets.
I mean completely played.  Until he's beat and the score is taken. You come in before we beat him and I'll kill him.  You'll have a tough time explaining that, won't ya.
For fifteen years.
Yeh, but I don't know where he is.
I never tried to kid you reporters -- I'm telling you the truth.
But tonight is Christmas Eve!
Said he stole his invention.
Why not? I am crazy....the whole family's crazy.
Go away!
Why not?
Do you know where he's living?  Oh....  Well, at least I'm glad he's all right.  Thank you for calling. Goodbye.
No.
I'll do nothing of the sort.
All right, then.  I'll tell them.
There!
He's waiting for you.
He wouldn't say.
Aren't you Nick Charles?
I've got to see you alone!
I bought it in a pawn shop.
I hate all that fuss.  But I'll do it on one condition -- that you're there to give me away.
This is my wedding.
You know how it is, Dad.  He's sort of under Mother's thumb.
Goodbye, my boy.  Take care of Dorothy.  Show her that there is such a thing as a happy marriage.
Man to man, I'm not.
Oh, he's all right.  We know all about him.  He does a little stooling for us every once in a while.
I'm calling your office so you can send out a man to trail him. I want to see where he goes.
Extraordinarily lucky.
You see, he'd been very clever. Everybody, even our astute friend Guild, thought that Wynant was alive and that he was the murderer. But our hero had just one weak link in his chain.  The telegrams, wires and telephones were all very well - but no one had seen Wynant. So he picked on poor Mimi here to strengthen his case.  Mimi is the only one at the table who can tell us who the real murderer is.  Mimi, who was it that told you to say you'd seen Wynant?
Do you know what they fought about that night he went away?
Why yes.
Goodbye.
Tell 'em.
Good morning, Lieutenant -  Sorry.
That's all I did, Lieutenant. That's the God's truth.  Maybe I said hello to her or how are you or something like that when I saw her, but that's all I knew her. That's the truth.  All right.  Put your mouth in and I'll pop a tooth out of it.
You wouldn't do that...  you wouldn't!
Wouldn't I.  Just watch me.
I don't like him.
What bonds?
Don't you remember....
No one else had the combination of that safe.  You took them.  What did you do with them?
supporting that gang of loafers! There's not one of them that cares a damn for you.  A wife who threw you out the first time your foot slipped.  They wouldn't raise a hand to help you.  And I've given my whole life for you.  If you kicked off tomorrow, where'd I be? Out in the gutter!  Sure I took those bonds.  Who has a better right -- ?
Go ahead!
Would it help any if I could persuade him to meet you?
Settle it yourself.  What have I got a lawyer for?
No word at all?
Well, don't you?
Dorothy!  Is she here?
You should have told them he'd disappeared.
And the murderer is right here in this room tonight... he's sitting at this table.  You may serve the fish.
It isn't a story - it's true.  I did see Wynant.  He's not dead.
Macaulay, you drew up Wynant's will.  Mimi was cut off, wasn't she, if she re-married?
Listen.  "Studsy" Burke told me you used to be O.K. That's why I'm here. Do  they....
How is Studsy?  I didn't know he was out of stir.
He's all right. He'd like to see you. But listen...  What's the law doing to me?  Do they think I did it, or is it just something else to pin on me?
This is your party.
Once I wanted five grand --  Cash -
As long as there isn't a fire hydrant.  What I've gone through --
I was hoping I wouldn't have to tell you.  Dorothy is really my daughter.  You see, it was Spring in Venice, and I was so young.  I didn't know what I was doing.  We were all like that on my father's side.
Six Martinis.  You're not going to have anything on me.
I wonder if they've --  I don't want to hear anything about it.
There's nothing I can do to help her.
All right... shoot!  I mean... what's on your mind?
Yeah.
Let's see.  Where's it from?
You talk as if I were Asta.
What's the matter with you?
We're going sightseeing -- aren't we, Asta?
I don't care - I'm just used to you, that's all --  If you let anything happen to him, you'll never wag that tail again!
Nick!
Yup.  Don't you want something to eat?
Huh?
Oh.  Well, the clothes for instance. They were carefully preserved, and the body was just as carefully destroyed.  The person who killed him counted on one thing... that all skeletons look alike.
I'm going to give a party, and invite all of the suspects.
Mimi...
No, Mr. Charles.
I had a key. I worked here... till they closed the shop.
No... no.
You his wife?
You're forgetting the check for your suitcase.  It's at the Grand Central.
I don't care what you wanted to tell me.  You're through!  Get your things and get out!
What's in the other direction?
Can you eat it?  If you can't eat it I really don't care what it is.
I'd settle for being alive.  Really. Alive would be fine.
We're going to keep driving.
Wha...
Oh, Jesus, they've stopped.
How tough you have to be to make the army?  All you've got to do is shoot a gun, and stop a bullet.
You just go when I say go.
We can fight.  That's what we're here for:  To fight the Iraqis.  To help the Shi'ites, and the Khurds.
Weird they didn't chase us.
What am I supposed to do?
I heard!
Ready when you are.
What about it?
Maybe I do.
Get out of my way.
Without that navicam looks to me like you forfeit the right to be in charge.
Sure, and I guess it was just convenient there was one less person to split the gold with.
No you're not.
Christ!  Wes, tell him.  You know this stuff.
Wh-what do you think--
Let's go.
I'm just going to have a little sip, that's all.  Just a sip.
Mine.  Land mine!
It's a mine, isn't it?
We're going to get off, all right.  We'll get you off of there.  Just...be cool.
You're moving away because it's going to blow up, isn't it!?  It's going to blow up!
It's not falling asleep.  You've only been standing there for three minutes.
Don't let me die, Epps.  I don't want to die.
But the white dot in the middle; that's got to mean something.
They're going to kill us!
It should, or it will?  Least going back the way we came we know what we're up against.
We'll find our way!  We'll...
What do you mean no?  They can fly us home.
That helicopter passes, and the only thing we're close to is death.
Yeah.
You know what I'm going to do?  I'm just going to take a second.  I want to look at the gold.
The deal was no one touches it until we get out of here.
Which boarder?  Saudi?  Kuwait?  Syria?
Couldn't be Syria.  We couldn't have gone that far north.  It's got to be Saudi. Come on.
Why haven't they killed us!?
I don't know!
You lie in the middle of the road, look like you're hurt.  When the car stops I run over to the driver and put a gun to his head.
Yeah, but why me?  What if the car doesn't stop?
Threatened to blow my brains out?
I don't know.
We'll make up some kind of lie.  They won't find the gold.
A map?  All I got is maps.  I'm gonna have Delayed Map Syndrome when I finally get out of here.  What kind of map you need?  Topographical, geographical, thermal?
Just...want to be ready when we do.
The photos.
You know the fifteenth is the deadline for the Iraqis to get out of Kuwait.
You don't know where the Iraqis have moved to.  And our forces haven't even engaged the Republican Guard yet, we don't know--
You know it's real.  You know it's real, and you know it's there.  You know it.
Yeah!  Gold!  How much?
Funny you should say that while we're out looking for gold.
Just seems weird they didn't chase us.
Lines up with the map and the photos.
Correct.
You've seen enough.
When?
He wants me to come to his quarters.
Looks like food.
I'll try.
You're not cleared for this precinct.  Let's cross over first.
If I take something, you suffer. If I don't, I stuff....
Impossible!
I wonder how far he went.  He's gathered invaluable information out there.
I don't feel well.
Listen to me....You have no need to distrust me.  We're going....
When?.....How?
What?
What kind of answer is that?
Yes...
f 2600 block of Lakefront. A limousine. But, I-
One partial from the handle matches the suspect from last night. Name's Carl Taylor. Long record of arson, assault, the works. The other print - we got nothing from our data base or the FBI or CIA... still waiting for Interpol.
Treat. We treat devices.
No you look, mister! First, you don't go calling my men names. It's bad for morale. Second, us "punks" happen to know a heck of alot more about police work than any vice cop ever did.
Oh yeah? Prove it.
I don't know. You tell me?
What not bad. You've got a series of bombs, devices, that may or may not be connected, set by one or many nutjobs, who may or may not be linked.
Where you guys at?
Cuz he got the girl, now he's leaving town.
What do we do?
Stay to your left.
Oh shit...
Let's get something straight. We're doing you a favor. You're not exactly a guy we want around explosives.
Who is he?
And what, you'll shoot me? Hey, don't mistake me for one of your partners, I'd like to make retirement in one piece.
What about the ballistics report?
Can it, Pluchinsky. And shove some cotton up your nose.
Ain't that a shit--
Captain assigned me to assist you.
Huh?
He's married, he don't even know what a lesbian is.
I know you're anxious to get back but... just stay out of homicide's way or I'll have you classifying fingerprints, understand?
Report on the case so far.
But from now on, any leads on this case go to Pluchinsky. He's primary investigator and you are unofficially assigned to the Bomb Squad... you and your new friends are not to be playing detective any more. Got it?
Fire me later. Close in and we got the bastard.
Yes.
Yes.
Tell M'sieu Giron I can't see him now. Impossible!  And, Jacques. Dismiss the car! Madame is not going. 
That's just what I tried to tell him. Well, one word led to another. He really was a very charming fellow. So we talked for about ten minutes.
Well--then it must be my mistake.  I beg your pardon.
And, waiter--you see that moon?
I want to see-- 
I don't want to see you at all!
Just a second.
I hope so, too.
Um-hum!
What is it?
Then why didn't you call the police? Why <u>don't</u> you call the police?  I'll tell you why--you crook, you.
Just call me Gaston.
You remember the man who walked into the Bank of Constantinople and walked out <u>with</u> the Bank of Constantinople?
Sweetheart, what day is today?
The six--
Spanish passports?
Lily, you must listen to me.
Shut up! Don't make up any stories!
Oh! You didn't read it!
Do you realize I have light eyes?
But, Madame Colet, that's a matter of eye shadow. I can straighten that out in two seconds.
You think that's too much?
Everything! ... Madame Colet, if I were your father--  which, fortunately, I am not--
You're hired!
Like that!
<u>Now</u>, <u>let</u> <u>me</u> <u>tell</u> <u>you</u>--
I <u>believe</u> you.
What would you say if you found your safe had been robbed?
Call the police?
Thank you.  Seventy-six, eighty--
And you expect me to believe that?
Lovely.
Yes, Madame Colet?
What is it, madame?
You know what Paris is saying about the Countess Falconier and her chauffeur?
Then why did you do it?
Well, he was in the navy.
Yes, my bag!
That's right.
About half, actually. Rose, you miss nothing, do you? In fact, I put in these new type davits, which can take an extra row of boats here.  But it was thought... by some... that the deck would look too cluttered. So I was over-ruled.
Hurry, Rose.
You are, Lewis.  You rolling?
I'm not going to help you browbeat my hundred and one year old grandmother. I came down here to tell you to back off.
We're running out of time. And this strutting martinet...  ...isn't letting any men in at all.
Yes. Your exertions below decks were no doubt exausting.
That's right. Two things dear to me have disappeared this evening. Now that one is back...  ...I have a pretty good idea where to find the other.  Search him.
Tell her that her daughter died with the Titanic.
I'll be alright. Hurry up so we can get going... we got our own boat to catch.
Get in... hurry up, it's almost full.
I always win, Jack. One way or another.  Pity I didn't keep that drawing. It's going to be worth a lot more by morning.
Smell ice, can you? Bleedin' Christ!
Captain, the press knows the size of Titanic, let them marvel at her speed too. We must give them something new to print. And the maiden voyage of Titanic must make headlines!
I prefer not to push the engines until they've been properly run in.
Rose. Rose DeWitt Bukater.
Uh huh. They'll be sorry. 'Course you'll be dead.
Oh God, I am such an utter fool.
May I?
No, no! Just with her hands.
That was a long one. My father used to say that whenever you saw one, it was a soul going to heaven.
Kinda like we're doin' right now -- uh oh!
To the stars.
Come with me, Jack. I jump, you jump... Right?
Right.
I'm so cold.
Yes, like a mill pond. Not a breath of wind.
It's make the bergs harder to see, with no breaking water at the base.
I should like to see my drawing.
Of course it's unfair! We're women. Our choices are never easy.
I had an idea your husband was getting suspicious.
I'm sorry, but you three men can play poker or something.  Shall I see you tomorrow?
And <U>do</U> bring Miss Marsh--  --when she's had time to tidy up a bit.
Sure! You're never at a loss for words.
Will you leave me alone?
Why worry? It was insured--how about that swimming lesson I promised you?
Sorry I can't return the compliment.
Lumber, ma'am--spent all my life out there piling up a bank balance--  --and now gosh darn it--"Honest Jack"--that's what they call me--is goin' to see the world.
No!--Did <U>you</U> take that bracelet?
No-o!
What did you want a gun for?
I'll bet a couple of hundred.
Oh, no--I played with <U>your</U> cards--in <U>your</U> cabin--at <U>your</U> suggestion--If you've got a kick coming, make it to the Purser.
I'll lay odds you get a pair of 'em--Why, a high-school kid could take you saps--and another thing--Lay off Sally Marsh.  --"Honest Jack"! One look at your mug and the whole world buttons up its pockets.
She looks like a lot of other boats. I grant you she's beautiful. 
Nice lines--
How about giving me another coat?
I want you to get used to my voice--you're going to hear it a lot.
Yes?
Well, I can't.
Decent?  I guess any guy could be decent--if you were interested.
For once I'm dead on the level--  --crazy about you!
But--
I think we'll live in Europe after we're married?
Just met her on the boat--supposed to play bridge with her yesterday--but she wouldn't--so we played poker instead.
Oh, you infant! How much did you lose?
Make it five.
I'll be waiting on deck.
No bank roll there, boy.  Lucky I could get you signed on--they picked up that Pittsburgh jeweler--made him talk. The heat's on, Shortie--and those Atlantic breezes are going to be mighty welcome.
Oh, no--You're not gonna give my hard-earned money away.
I'll need it--gave my last buck to the bedroom steward.
Until then--the dollar forty stays with me.
Change?
Right!--but it doesn't have to apply to you--Keep your eyes open for anybody wearing a lot of cracked ice and give me the office.
You know where that sense of humor's goin' to get you one of these days--
Oh, is she? What a shame!  You'll pardon me?
Make it three, boys--I'll play this hand pat.
No, thanks--I never gambled in my life.
If he lets you down I'll try my hand at sleuthing--  Bet I could find that bracelet--
Nervous. Couldn't sleep. Feel like a nightcap? 
Why?
Nooooo!--going to catch up on my reading.  I'll take this one.
Anybody that's taken the trouble to get it would be a mug to put it back.
She was to meet me here--why don't you wait? She ought to be here any minute.
I should say not.
That's right--here's the eighty cents for you. I'd rather see you get it than the company--send it right off.
No. <U>Knots</U>!
I was never stiffer in my life.
All right, folks, get on your mark. When you hear the pistol shot--
Never mind.
It's all right--if you like honest faces--let's have another drink--Steward!
Yeah--
Still got my picture, I see--I was pretty dumb then, wasn't I, Chad?
I came to tell you what a swell guy I think you are to do this--
You made it possible for us to get away at a few hours' notice--you never asked why, but I guess you know.
But not nice enough to marry--eh?
What's the matter, Mary?
Maurice Chevalier! There's a fellow with personality.
Well, he has a straw hat--
Good-night, folks.
You've got a gun, haven't you, Chad? Will you let me have it?
Well, I helped my hand so I'll have to see you.
You ran away because you were afraid. I don't want it to end like that.
I didn't want to see you again--that's my privilege.
No!
I mean if you knew it were stolen.
I've got a hunch you're going to win that bet, Inspector.
It all depends on what you're used to.
I was in his cabin--
If he comes near you again, I'll break his neck--
Ain't got time.
I saw him take the bracelet out of that shoe.
Just this minute.  I'm Wyatt Earp, These're my brothers-
That's not what I meant.
Yes, very.  And very married.
Maybe even my destiny.
Easy, Johnny.  Now ain't the time.  I tell you, boys, even I'm Worried what'll happen once Ringo Runs this outfit!  God have mercy!
They were all gonna jump me back There.  What ever happened to one Against one?
I know.  Just did what you had to. That banner and stuff, that's Just Ike.  Don't worry about it.
I see, off to strike it rich, Huh.  All right, fine, wish you Luck.  Tell you this though, never Was a rich man yet didn't wind up With a guilty conscience.
Yeah, you look it.
And you must be Ringo.  Look, Darling, Johnny Ringo.  The Deadliest pistoleer since Wild Bill, they say.  What do you Think, darling?  Should I hate him?
Forgive me if I don't shake hands.
And what a maiden, pure as the Driven snow, I'm sure.
A which?
Hell, I got lot's of friends.
Told you.  I'm red hot, I'm Blazin'!  Now, red seven.  Seven Stinkin' diamonds.  Look out!  Five Thousand!  Let's go!
I'll pay you 500 each in advance And I'll mount you on those.
Good God, you're really-
Cards in spades.  I'm in love with Every second of her life.  Hell, I'll probably love her when I'm dust.
I'll be dipped in shit.  I will, too.
Easy now... That mare's in season.
You'd die for fun?
How would you know?
Room service.
Well he's handsome and he's Charming.  He's all right.  For Now.  Don't say it, I know, I'm Rotten.  I can't help it.  I've Tried to be good but it's too Boring.
I didn't mean it that way.
Wait!
I think I'll just lie down awhile
I don't know.  I'm all right.
All right, run 'em off.
Hey!  Virgil!  My God!  Morgan!  Hey, Boy!  You look great!  Both of you!
Well what do you think happens When you die?
That didn't sound like thunder.
What's it look like?  They want a Piece of me they can come and get It, I'm not crawlin' into my hole.
I know, I was wrong.  But Morg, Look, we got to get out.
Well I'm real scared.
Doc's just in no kinda shape.
Acquired?
Business is business.  Don't have To love 'em to work with 'em.  Not If there's money in it.
Bundle up, Virge.  Cold out there.
- I'll be sure to acknowledge 007's 'assistance' in my report to the Prime Minister. But this is, still, a naval operation.
Admiral, are you suggesting -
I tried to save her. But she remained a manic depressive: Fits, inappropriate behavior... Delusions of grandeur.
I wonder if it runs in the family.
...Words to live by?
I appreciate your time -
- We all want what we can't have?
No, 007. It's just that I've learned from personal experience - that when we get what we want -  Somehow the reality is never as... Satisfying as the fantasy.
Retired. I'm not getting paid to help you save the world anymore.
... 17 Beverage cup holders?
What are you talking about? We went through all this and the ship isn't even down there?
I know what I saw -
Leave me alone! He's going to kill me!!
Need I remind the two of you that Elliot Harmsway - Sir Elliot Harmsway - is directly descended from the Earl of Aberdeen? That his Scottish ancestors practically invented Hong Kong - and out of sheer gratitude, Queen Victoria herself named the port "Aberdeen Harbor" in their honor?
Let's take a look at the body.
We work in the dark. We do what we can.
Of course.
Sidney Winch.
No. But you can buy a drink for my friend, Taro.
I see my date is here.  And I think Mr. Bond is ready to leave.
- The family jewels?
Thank you.  "Now hear this: Drop dead."
He was my father's best friend!
He's killed closer.
Maybe. But why are we going up instead of down?
What do you mean?
...You know, that's another reason you're probably not in a successful relationship.
And when might that be?
Remind me.
Tsi tien, Professor Wu.
Who's Wade?
I was an attorney!
Excellent.
What's wrong?
Kill him! Finish it!
...Haven't we already paid him for his services?
Since when?
Maybe I can get down there next week.
I told her I would if she would give me time.
You were in hell?
It is just a regular card.
You probably heard the wind stirring up those dead leaves over there.
Everyone is gone. Rhonda is in the bathroom.
Hush.
I'm trying to make him a man but you keep babying him.
It would be nice.
No, I'm too hot now.
You better be careful. You'll get a stroke arguing.
I have to feed the chickens before they wake everybody up.
I don't want to hear any tales about colored people...
My feet have never been on anything that wasn't directly attached to the ground.
Stay until you feel better? I would like to hear all the news.
That's awful generous of you. I always ask to keep from wearing out welcome.
You and Babe Brother hit it off so well.
I was afraid to go to Marcus Bottom because of him.
She has a fish bone caught in her throat. Could all of you go in the other room? Gideon, get some bread and toast it quickly and find me the cod liver oil.
As long as he keeps his throat clear, he is able to get some rest.
Miss Clara's boy, Emory, to start with. The Johnson's Hocker was another one...
You damn right they didn't, especially Emory, my cousin.
Emory had made a lot of enemies. He had a big mouth.
Last Saturday we handed out over two hundred meals.
Week by week the crowds at the door keeps getting larger. We can't feed all the hungry.
That is a boy from home, Lulla's brother.
Ya, but you can't do the shuffle with one leg. You and your wife, in your spare time, work with the less fortunate. Now I'm not talking about you and what you do but some folks that always run to help the victim, deep down are attracted to pain and suffering and love to be near the dying.
I thought you weren't old fashioned.
Harry always shows his good side and, like the moon, the other side is black. Back home he always did try to act like the colored gentleman. I'm telling you Harry is nothing but evil. I'm warning you -- you can't keep a wild animal as a pet around children.
Everybody who have been associated with Harry end up with pennies over their eyes.
Whadda ya think?
What?  What is it?
Well sure, look at him.  He's got more gadgets on him then a Swiss army knife.
Merry Christmas, Sheriff.
HO-YAAAHH!!!
Well, let's see, we've got double A's --
Yes, I can.
Can't!  Can't!  Can't!
I tell you, I could fly around this room with my eyes closed!
Buzz, I would love to see you try.  'Course I'd love to see you as a crater.
But we're not on my planet, are we?
No.
Sorry.
Where is it?  I don't see the --
Hey!!  Hey!  How are you doing that? Stop that!
Don't you get it?!  You see the hat? I am Mrs. Nesbit!! 
Look at me!  I can't even fly out of a window!
I can't do it!  Take care of Andy for me!
The match!
How 'bout three out of five?
She's lying!  Whatever she says it's not true!
You murdering dog!
Hey look!  It's Buzz!
There aren't any more!  That's the whole barrel.
I'm cold.
I know for a fact he didn't take Jonathon. Jonathon went off by himself.
Nothing ... You shouldn't have given Victoria that Guinness.
I wanted my Leda to be a little girl. Leda and the swan. See?
No, of course not.  She's one of the top students at her school.
Well, I hope it stays that way.
Arnie, thank God.
Listen to me carefully.  First of all, Carl isn't here.  DEA's got him and they'll hang on to him until arraignment, which will probably be tomorrow.  So here you're wasting your time.  Are you with me?
Arnie, I feel like Alice stepping through the looking glass.
Of course he is.  I've known him for twenty years and he doesn't jaywalk...
How much do I pay him?
I can't do that.
So's the video camera.
What about legalizing everything? Has anybody talked about that?
Fine -- legalization.  Okay, forgetting all of our international trade agreements, legalize everything today.  The Government inserts itself into all drug transactions.  The U.S. becomes a giant pharmacy.  Our borders are mobbed, lines of people from here to Europe wanting to smoke, snort and shoot themselves into oblivion.
Somehow, I don't see that happening.
Live with your parents?
What's that mean?
Why?  Nobody's there.
Winners don't do coke.  Or haven't you been reading the bumper stickers?
You can learn a lot about somebody from this stuff.  Three categories: you like me, you hate me, you want something from me.  Definitely third category.
All the professionals keep them in the trunk.
It's a death sentence.  I'll never make it to the trial.
The worst thing about you, Monty, is you realize the futility of what you're doing and you do it anyway. I wish you could see how transparent you are.  This food tastes like shit.
I don't know, sir.
There are plenty of other suppliers in Mexico.
Yeah.  It should be fun.  You wanna come?
Go home.  Get cleaned up.  Get to work.  Salazar is heading down to Mexico City next week and I'm not getting left behind.  Don't fuck this up.
What?
What is it you want me to do?
That would probably mean the Tijuana Cartel is gaining power?
I've read official estimates but I wouldn't bet my house on them.  I've heard the entire cocaine supply for the United States can fit into four tractor-trailers.  At least a half-dozen of those cars right out there are carrying a load of dope, with drivers employed by people who don't give a damn if they're caught or not.
I want your money, I'll take your money.
Just tell me where she is.
I'm not the police.  I don't care about experimentation.  She's a kid. I'm worried to death.
We sometimes went downtown to score.
Hopefully the exchange of training methods and information between our countries will help with this problem.
Addicts treat themselves... they overdose and then there's one less to worry about.
What?  I thought Madrigal was dead. I thought it was verified.
It's fucking boring after a while without the cards.
I'm sorry.
You'll never catch us, you flabby bastard. Right, see, when I come back --
If everyone keeps their mouth shut, there'll be no one going to jail.
You daft cunt. If you're going to waste it like that, you might as well leave it all to me. Now get the drinks in.
Let's face it, it could have been wonderful.
Two thousand, one hundred and thirty- three pounds.
Did you bring the cards?
What?
Right. You can't sleep here.
Come on.
Jesus.
Holding hands?
Yes, as a matter of fact, it is.
No.
Too young for what?
Sixteen next month.
I didn't either. What the fuck is it?
It'll be here somewhere. I might have returned it by mistake.
No.
Following the game at all?
No, I'm clean.
No problem.  No problem -- easy to say when its some other poor cunt with shite for blood.
People think it's all about misery and desperation and death and all that shite, which is not to be ignored, but what they forget - Spud is shooting up for the pleasure of it. Otherwise we wouldn't do it. After all, we're not fucking stupid. At least, we're not that fucking stupid. Take the best orgasm you ever had, multiply it by a thousand and you're still nowhere near it. When you're on junk you have only one worry: scoring. When you're off it you are suddenly obliged to worry about all sorts of other shite. Got no money: can't get pished. Got money: drinking too much. Can't get a bird: no chance of a ride. Got a bird: too much hassle. You have to worry about bills, about food, about some football team that never fucking wins, about human relationships and all the things that really don't matter when you've got a sincere and truthful junk habit.
One hundred and sixteen minutes.
Give me the gun.
What?
And I'll tell you why. Because I'm fed up to my back teeth with losers, no-hopers, draftpacks, schemies, junkies and the like. I'm getting on with life. What are you doing?
Why would I want to sell my passport?
Yeah. No more. I'm finished with that shite.
Sure, sure. I've heard it before.
No, I don't think so.
Why, thank you.
The strategy is this: get clean, get mobile, get into dealing, and this time next year I'll be watching the rising sun with a posse of oriental buttocks parked on my coupon.
It will be. It'll make a change for three miserable junkies who don't know what they want to do with themselves since they stopped doing smack.
Are you serious?
I've got balls like watermelons, I'm telling you.
Went ballistic?
No. Well, yes. I have to admit it: I'm a perfectionist. For me, it's the best or nothing at all. If things go badly, I can't be bothered, but I have a good feeling about this interview. Seems to me like it's gone pretty well. We've touched on a lot of subjects, a lot of things to think about, for all of us.
And we can't see a thing. Request you direct us to the coordinates.
We will be happy to beam down. But first we must have certain assurances.
Do you realize what you've done? It wasn't bloodshed I wanted.
With all due respect, the Enterprise is a disaster. There must be other ships in the quadrant.
The power was within you.
What is it you seek?
Mr. Scott, you're amazing.
Beam up Spock and Dr. McCoy. Now!
Go, Sulu.
Ah, Captain?
Go to sleep, Spock.
We don't have 1.2 hours.
Technically, you are correct. I do not have a brother.
If I activate them now, Captain, we will be propelled upward at an unbelievable rate.
You staged all this to get your hands on my ship?
Sybok, listen to me. In order for this craft to enter the landing bay, Enterprise must lower the shields and activate the tractor beam. To get us inside and re-raise the shields will take-
Because you, too, must know.

He's not?
I'm sorry, Spock. I can't surrender now. I'm not through violating Neutral Zone Treaty. In fact, I'm just getting started. And now for my next violation I intend to steal something. Something very big.
No. You must kill me.
You know I'm right.
I don't understand..  Reveal yourself to me!
This is my doing. This is my arrogance... my vanity...
Yepper. And Vice Squad, and Meltdown... whole slew of 'em. I was this close  to starting my own little enterprise. But: enter Ed Dillinger. Another software engineer -- not so young, not so bright, but very, very sneaky. One night, our boy Flynn goes to his terminal, tries to read up his file, and ... nothing. A big blank. We now take you to three months later. Ed Dillinger presents ICOM with five video games he has "invented" -- the slime didn't even change the names -- and he gets a big fat promotion. Thus begins his meteoric rise to...what is he now, Executive V.P.?
Yeah. Tryin' to find the file and erase it. Once that's gone, ain't nothin' can stop him. Just Eddie and his Master Control Program, runnin' things from on high..
Want one?
You call that getting over it?
I'm certainly not.
Well, you have to expect some static. Computers are just machines after all, they can't think...
They'll start to soon enough.
Alan. Alan Bailey.
We have to close that down, just briefly. Security reasons.  Someone with that access has been tampering.
I'm afraid so. I spotted him this time and kicked him out, but he's getting trickier all the time.
I'm sorry -
It shouldn't be any harder than General Motors was. But now...this is what I get for using humans.
You wouldn't dare.
Really. You'd have programs lined up around the block to use this place -- and no MCP looking over your shoulder.
I, uh... I'm a program from a User that... knows Alan...?
Tanks...coming back. Let's go.
You're alive!
Yeah, I... oops!
It grows on you.
Alan-One...
We'll get them, sir... These things take time.
I don't have time, Sark. And neither do you. End of line.
We have to.
Just an hour?  You should tell this stud to take more time.
Out.
You'd tell me if there was something wrong, wouldn't you, pumpkin?
You're going to stay in school. Do you understand?
No way.  Not Dana.
Uh huh.  Want me to lose them?
Sure, Harry.  I'm on it.
You tell on me, I tell on you.
Get 'em.  I'll brief them on the way in.
Here they come.
Sorry.
I don't know.  I guess... I wanted to see what would happen.
No!  Never!
So, it was your first time.
God!  You have no idea how much that turns me on.  I've never had the courage to say this before but... I love you, Janice.
Especially in this light.  This is the only light they had then,				* so I like to study it this way. I love this place.  I love all ruins.
They must've just missed me.
Yes.
What do you think?  Of course yes!  What's involved?
What?  Oh, the flat tire?  Yeah, I thought the damn towtruck was never going to get there.
It makes you tell the truth?
My God.  Have you had to...  have sex with other women in the line of duty?
Did you pork her Harry?
Dance?
So you're basically lying your ass off the whole time?  I couldn't do it.
What about the husbands?
Something you obviously have a hard time doing!
Fuck you.
Okay.  It's just, things are a bit hot for me right now.  If I get a signal...  I may have to leave suddenly.
Sometimes a story is a mask for a covert operation.  See-- two men killed in a restroom, and two unidentified men in a running					* shootout, ending at the						* Marriot...
Relax.  There, that's better. Let yourself slip into the role.
What letter?
This is great, we got cable.
Yeah. I got elbowed right in the eye. And if that wasn't enough, I got hurled the ball when I'm not looking. Wam! Right in my face.
What kind of daughterly smackeroo was that?
Don't eat anything.
Yeah. I'm fine. It didn't hurt.
Want some Goobers?
He ain't so much good guy as he's just a bad motherfucker. Sonny don't be bullshittin'. He fucks dudes up for life. Hold on, a fight scene's coming up.
You took a cab to see three kung fu movies?
I suppose you gotta get up early, huh?
I'd love some pie.
What do you do?
Where are you from.
Phil Spector. Girl group stuff. You know, like "He's a Rebel".
What are your turn-ons?
Mickey Rourke, somebody who can appreciate the finer things in life, like Elvis's voice, good kung fu, and a tasty piece of pie.
Yeah, I got the key, so I come here at night, hang out, read comic books, play music.
How long have you worked here?
I didn't even know they had stores that just sold comic books.
Five.
Uh-huh.
That dazzling imagination.
My pimp.
Well, I wouldn't go so far as to call him nice, but he's treated me pretty decent. But I've only been there about four days. He got a little rough with Arlene the other day.
Of course. Are there others, Mr. Worley?
No, Clarence. Just forget it, babe. I just wanna disappear from there.
I'm gonna hop in the tub and get all wet, and slippery, and soapy. Then I'm gonna lie in the waterbed, not even both to dry off, and watch X-rated movies till you get your ass back to my lovin' arms.
With a vengeance, I hated them.
How come?
It's got a nice ring to it. It sounds like a movie. "Clarence and Alabama Go to Cancoon". Don't 'cha think?
Naw naw!
I can't believe what you're tellin' me.
You'd really do that?
If I thought I could get away with it -
Oh, and your line to Charles Atlas in there: "I'll take that gun", "You'll have to".
That was cool, wasn't it? You know, I don't even know where that came from. I just opened my mouth and it came out. After I said it I thought, that's a cool line, I gotta remember that.
I'm a married man.
Has he gotten his mail today?
It'll get ya high.
I don't know! A fuckin' lot!
He's nothing. He's in my acting class. But he works as an assistant to a very powerful movie producer named Lee Donowitz. I thought Donowitz could be interested in a deal like this. He could use it. He could afford it.
Where?
The zoo.
Two guys.
Yeah?
What are we gonna see?
Look, Dick, I don't -
They'll be along.
Yeah?
The biggest. The biggest movie you've ever dealt with, Lee. We're talkin' a lot of film. A man'd have ta be an idiot not to be a little cautious about a movie like that. And Lee, you're no idiot.
A Norms in Van Nuys.
Anything stronger?  Oh, probably not. Beer? You can drink beer, can't you?
Uh, yeah... there's a party store down 54th.
No.
Now I can't be sure of how much of what he told you. So in the chance you're in the dark about some of this, let me shed some light. That whore your boy hangs around with, her pimp is an associate of mine, and I don't just mean pimpin', in other affairs he works for me in a courier capacity. Well, apparently, that dirty little whore found out when we're gonna do some business, 'cause your son, the cowboy and his flame, came in the room blastin' and didn't stop till they were pretty sure everybody was dead.
Sure.
Step inside.
Absolutely.
Look, we don't care if you bring in the state milita, the volunteer fire department, the L.A. Thunderbirds, the ghost of Steve McQueen, and the twelve Roman gladiators, so long as we get credit for the bust.
No don't sit here and feed us some shit.
You're a fuckin' star! And you're gonna be playin' your little one-man show nightly for the next two fuckin' years for a captive audience -
But there is a bright side though. If you ever have to play a part of a guy who gets fucked in the ass on a daily basis by throat-slitting niggers, you'll have so much experience to draw on -
That is, of course, if you don't catch Aids from all your anal intrusions.
Krinkle, you're lookin' at the two future cops of the month. We have it, and if I say we, I don't mean me and him, I'm referring to the whole department. Haven't had a decent bust this whole month. Well, we mighta come in like a lamb, but we're goin' out like a lion -
Hope you're a good actor, Elliot.
Naw, man, it ain't white boy day.
That's bullshit.
Yeah, I live here.
How do you know? You been there?
Then where the hell do you get off talkin' that kind of talk?
We're going to think about it, Cole. Among ourselves.  We'll get back to you.
Cole, did you or did you not record that message?
You've been in an institution, haven't you, James?  A hospital?
A jail?  Prison?
I love this air.  This is wonderful air.
It's so clean.  No germs.
You're afraid of germs?
I have the...strangest feeling I've met you before...a long time ago, perhaps. Were you ever...?
I have to do this, James.  You're very confused.
I just have to locate the virus in its original form before it mutates.  So scientists can come back and study it and find a cure.  So that those of us who survived can go back to the surface of the earth.
I did him a favor.  Now come on.
James, why don't we...?
Lock it now!
And he told you then his father was a famous virologist.
No.  I want you to turn yourself in, James -- It'll go much better for you if you do -- but I'm not going to trick you.
It can be dealt with, but only if you want to.  I can help you.
I don't know -- I don't remember.
James, you said he was hiding in the barn...
I remember you...like this.  I feel I've known you before.  I feel I've always known you.
Airports all look the same.  Maybe it's...  James!  Your moustache!  It's slipping.
I was here...as a kid.  I think you were here, too.  But you...looked just like you look now.
I'll get the tickets and meet you... in the Gift Shop.
What...???
Listen to me -- I can't do anything about what you're going to do. I can't change anything.  I can't stop you.  I just want some information...
I get it!  This is your old plan, right?
And that's when I told you my father was this famous virologist and you said, "Hey, he could make a germ and we could steal it!"
Who am I supposed to shoot?
It's a digital reconstruction of a message, Cole, from a weak signal on our contact number.  Did you make that call?
He should have been in restraints.  It was bad judgment on your part, plain and simple.  why not just cop to it?
She knew about it, Jeffrey.  She knew you were going to try this.
What virus are we talking about, Dad?
You're insane, Jeffrey.
He's been tested for drugs?
Don't call me old man.  Ain't you got no respect, boy?
Hell no, I can't do that myself. I'm blind.  Can't you see that?
That's 'cause he's dead.
I can see just fine.  For example: You're a young man who thinks he's got someplace to be.
Think you'll live that long?
Same back at you.
I need a ticket.
Out of here.
One way, or round trip?
The ticket is thirty dollars.
You own this place?
Damn.  Gonna be another hot one today.
Well, you know so much why don't you just fix it yourself?
Time.
Twenty-after-ten.
Truck stop up a piece.  Not much, but us simple folk like it.
Another accident?  You got to be more careful.
Sweet talk me all you want, I still want my hundred-forty-five dollars.
That's a good piece of advice, Darrell.
It's going to cost you two-hundred dollars.
I'm taking my car, and I'm taking it now!
You listen to me, you fancy city man.  You owe me money, and this car ain't going nowheres until I get it. And if you take another five hours I'll find another fifty dollars worth of work to do on her.  Now get out of here!  You're stinking up my garage.
You got the money?
'Cept that she lost her money and the sons of bitches stole her wedding ring.  That's when she started shooting.  Can't blame her. The ring was all Carlos left her when he died.
I . . .
Same thing you want.  I want to be out of Sierra; to be able to do as I please.  But that takes money.
Wrong number.
You haven't even looked at them once.
I picked them out for you, Jake.  I thought you would like the colors.
You're pretty full of yourself, aren't you?
I just got tired of looking at the old drapes.  Had them long as I can remember.
'Course they cost a little more than I should really be spending.  But, damn it, I don't hardly ever do anything nice for myself.  I deserve nice things.
I couldn't stay in this place.  I wouldn't.  I'd just pick up, do whatever I had to do, and get out.
I guess.  I've got an ego same as any man.
What do you do anyway?
What?
You flirt with me, then you run cold.  You lead me on, then slap me down.  I don't go for being jerked around.
Maybe I like to find out about a man first.  Maybe I like to know what he's made of.
Yeah, but I like the sun.  I grew up on a reservation.  The sun, the desert; they were like a religion to us.  Jake's the same way.  He loves the desert.  I guess we're alike that way.  That's about the only way.
No.
Please.  I won't hang on you.  As soon as we get there you can dump me.  I don't care.  I just want to get out of here.
I know where we could get the money. A lot more than one-hundred-fifty dollars.
Jake.
Is it so bad?  It would be quick. He wouldn't even have to feel it.
What about us?
I've thought about you every second since I left.  I can still taste you on my lips.
Stop it.
We don't have to kill him.  Just knock him out and tie him up 'till we get away.
To get my car.
Funny thing.
He was going to take the money.
Now we dump Jake, split the money, then you're on your own.
But you said we could be together.
I was going to back the car to the ridge and pull you up.
Yeah, they'll find you.  Dried up and twice dead.
You've got to be--
Yeah, I know.  More careful.
Would I what?
Hungry?
No.
You're talking like a mad man.
That was just loose talk.  I don't want anybody dead.
Bullshit.  You wanted me to kill her.
For that I'd kill a nun on Easter Sunday.
Just to get out of here?  That doesn't seem much for a murder.
How the hell should I know?  I've never had a wife killed before.  I guess I should have hired a professional.
You love her, but you hate her?
All I have in the world.
Trouble with the car again?
Jake--
What are you . . . you can't . . . you can't kill me.
You know what kind of woman Grace is.  You know how badly she wants to get the fuck out of Sierra.  What makes you think when you were planning on killing her she wasn't doing the same for you?  What's she to you, Jake; a woman who would have you dead?  Let me kill her.  All I want is two-hundred dollars to get out of here with.
She's dead.
I wasn't going to fight for you.  I was just going to beat the shit out of your boyfriend.
I don't care what you believe as long as you leave me alone.
You know who I am?  Toby N. Tyler. My friends call me TNT. You know why?
Stand up.
Hello?  Hello!?  Operator, I got disconnected.  Hello . . .
Yeah.  What are you going to do? That Toby's a hot head.
You ain't passing these test, son. If I can't trust you I'm gonna have to arrest you . . .
Hablar slowly, por favor.  My ingles no es bien.
I don't know.  I thought you were keeping the sun out of your eyes.
Christ!
...And everything is nothing too.
All them miners last century. Hungry ghosts, killed off all the Indians. Up at the mine. Earth ran red with blood, think I'm fooling around here. White sky was on fire. Grown men cried like babies. I saw a flash, then darkness descended upon me. They put me in the joint. Took my eyes. I cursed them. White people can't seem to stay away from Indians . You gotta watch where ya put your fingers. Pussy pussy pussy, Indian pussy.
Stand up.
My honor, that's what I'm fighting over. Now get up off the ground, or do I have to whoop you where you lie?
This means something to you?  Jenny means something to me.
I swear to you that's all that happened.  I haven't so much as set foot in your bedroom.
I'll give you a lift, son. Too hot to be walking... People die out here, y'know.
I hope so.  Listen, McKenna about your wife:  If I had known she was married--
It wouldn't have made a difference to you, now would it?  Not a wit.  Do you know why? Because you're a man without scruples.
Ah, I can smell it on you.
How do you know if you've never tried?
About things.  About your wife.
The slimy bastard who's going to do it for you...  You're a jealous man Jake. If you can't have Grace to yourself...well, you're not the sharing kind.
You love her, but you hate her?
And tell her what?
For what?
Eighteen... Well, I'm gonna be eighteen in two years, but that don't mean you can't take me for a ride if you want.
What the hell are you talking about?
Nope.  Darrell.
It's your radiator hose.  It's busted.
I'm very interested in this but is there someplace...
"That's not just a Ford, that's a sixty-four-and-a-half Mustang."
Then you ain't gonna have the car.
No charge.
What reputation?  You're nothing but an ignorant, inbred, tumbleweed hick.
Is that an insult?  Are you insulting me.
Yeah, like Al Capone on tax day. Get the keys?
Figgers. There's a scratch on the hood and how much you make selling my gun? Deduct it.
That's right on my way.
You're not from around here, are you?
All over.  Chicago, Houston, Detroit.  Just lately Dallas.
You've been around.
If you're going to gamble, might as well play for high stakes.
What happens when you lose?
A medicine man?
Nice house for a shaman's daughter.  You must be good.
Beautiful?
How do you know he's still not here?
Walk away.
You'd never understand.
Try me.
...you could get me money. I'll get you out of here.
What do you mean?
If the key's on him, how do we get the key?
I thought you couldn't get your car.
I don't give a damn about the money.  I want you, and I want to get us out of this shithole.  There's only one way to do that.
No! You get it!
I got the money all packed.  I put the jeep and his caddy in the garage. People'll think maybe me and Jake went away.  Buy us some time...I know a back road we can take.
You don't know what it feels like to be free of that place.
I'm not sailing his boat.
He was a <u>cop</u>, Grace, they never stop looking for you when you kill a cop...
You could give me my gun back.
Why? So when the cops catch up with us you can sell me out again?
He <u>can't</u> help you now, honey!
Harlin's.
Yeah, fell down and hit a rock. Not as bad as it looks.
And that's not the half of it, Mr. Arkadin...
...And let me guess.  This robber -- he gets your money.
Out of here.
But, in particular?
I ... Mexico.  You got a bus that goes to Mexico?  That's where I have to go.
How much?
I'll fuckin' take it. To go.
No baby, you got it wrong.
Oh no! Oh please forgive me, Papa!
There's someone in the house.
Aw, Toby, we weren't doing nothing.  We was just talking.
Vat? I am going 5 miles an hour! I am looking town. I not even moving.
What? You trying to bribe me, mister? Just cause you Russians ain't commies anymore, don't think money can buy everything...
Is Noel in?
Oh.
Ask if he can check how many sick days I've taken since I've worked here?
I haven't been sick this year. I know that.
Oh.
Jeremy what the hell are you doing?
Soft and Wet, by the Artist Formerly Known as Prince.
What was that?
You assumed wrong.
The life of an idea that has lived too long in my head.
Not money.  But I appreciate your healthy cynicism in the manner. It will be wise for both of us to proceed with greatest caution.
You could have poured coffee in Starbucks, you could have learned to install track lighting in office buildings, you could have told people their horoscopes on the internet... You could have been one of ten thousand things... but in the end, you chose to protect people. You made that decision... and I find that very, very interesting.  Now all I need is your credit card number.
You're skill.
Characters in comic books are often attributed special powers. X-ray vision, things of that sort.
That's not what I witnessed David.
I'm very proud of him.  He's been through a lot in his life. A lot of ups and downs, a lot of bad spells. A couple I'd thought had broken him... I mean emotionally.  They were bad... But he made it. Yes he did.
Yes he is.
How about your room then? If you get scared like before, you can come back in here?
What things?
What if you only ate foods that were good for you and you worked out everyday for a year?
Do you know why?
Jeremy if you pull that trigger I'm going to leave! I'm going to go to New York.
...And everyone lived happily ever after.
For a second there I thought you were a fanatic.
Why?
On a bench, across the street.
I fined 'em instead.
We was... lyin'.
What wife? He don't have no wife.
Asked what they looked like, that's all. Christ, maybe he's tough but he sure ain't no carpenter.
Just wondered. Anybody could be scared.
You want... a free one.
Your wife?
Well, I was always tasting the soup two hours after I et it.
Alive?
Uh... a little, maybe.
Word must have got all the way to Texas by now.
That much, huh?
Nope. They'll stay out on the Spade country where they got friends.
Like I said, I...
There ain't no snakes in here, Mister Hendershot.
Some folks did call Old Corky "Two Gun" but not because he was sportin' two pistols but because he had a dick so big it was longer than the barrel on that Walker Colt he carried. An' the only insultin' he done was stickin' that big dick of his in some French Lady that Old Bob was sweet on... Well, one day Corky walked into the Blue Bottle and before he knows what's happening Bob takes a shot at him... and misses on account of he's drunker than hell.
But... if he doesn't miss?
What'd Ned say?
Well, Uncle Pete said you was the goddamndest meanest sonofabitch ever lived an' if I ever wanted a partner for a killin', you was the worst one. Meanin' the best. On account of you're cold as snow an' don't have no weak nerve nor fear.
I was gonna kill them two by myself. It don't take three.
Sorry, Ned. Guess I wasted your time. See ya, Kid!
Yeah.
Yup.
Just SHOOT!
Oh Ch-ch-christ... it don't... it don't seem... real... How he's... DEAD... how he ain't gonna breathe no more... n-n-never. Or the other one neither... On account of... of just... pullin' a trigger.
Well, I gu-guess they had it... comin'.
I thought you wanted to buy spectacles an' fancy clothes an' all.
I'd rather be blind and ragged than dead, I guess.
I never c-c-carry arms. I'm... a writer.
Who was next? Clyde? Or was it...?
Should be easy killin' em... supposin' they don't run off to Texas first.
Well, I guess they got it comin'...  But you wouldn't go if Claudia was alive.
Two weeks, I guess.
I ain't blamin' her, Ned, I ain't holdin' it against her.  She knew me back then... an' she seen what a no good sonofabitch I was... an' she won't allow how I've changed. She just don't know how I ain't like that no more.
You're marking us, Bill.
Last night I said I missed my fuckin' wife... tonight I just miss my fuckin' bed.
Easy, Bill, easy.
Three? That ain't bad considerin'.
All that money... I mean... did you...?
I'm a damn good shot.  See that hawk up there? I could kill that hawk with one shot.
Well, I gotta know what kind of fellas I'm ridin' with, don't I? In case of a scrape.
All of it. About him, an' you an' Uncle Pete... about robbin' the Rock Island Pacific... an' about them Missouri Banks.
He didn't know. No one doing the deal knew except a few key people. This guy says they were real hush about it. Whatever it was it was highly sensitive.
They tell me you got the cripple from New York in there. He mention Keyser Soze
&lt;&lt;Don't be stupid.&gt;&gt;
I'm having a stroke.
Just forget about it.
No. It's never going to stop, period. It won't take more than a week before every investor in this city is walking away from us. It's finished. I'm finished.
I had a guy's fingers in my asshole tonight.
Why you gotta go and do that? I'm trying to make a point.
Can we stealth these guys?
Verb - Roger, this is Edie Finneran. Edie, this is Roger Kint, he was at
Don't tell me you don't need this. Is this your place?
Fenster and Hockney?
Three million?
Just do what I tell you.
Mr. Soze made a few calls, yes. You were not to be released until I came to see you. It seems Mr. Keaton's attorney, Ms. Finneran, was a bit too effective in expediting his release. Holding the rest of you became a moot point.
Mr. Soze will be most -
Mr. So- My employer has made up his mind. He does not change it.
A friend of mine in New York tells me you knew Spook Hollis.
I hear you did time with old Spook. Yeah, he was a good egg. I used to run a lot of dope for him. Fuckin' shame he got shivved.
Some Limey. He's a middle-man for somebody. He doesn't say and I don't ask.
Which is shit.
What?
Keaton was a piece of shit.
I'11 be sure to mention that to him.
No.
Do I? Keaton was under indictment a total                 + of seven times when he was on the force.                  + In every case, witnesses either reversed                  + their testimony to the grand jury or died                 + before they could testify. When they                      t finally did nail him for fraud, he spent                  + five years in Sing Sing. He killed three prisoners inside - one with a knife in the tailbone while he strangled him to death. Of course I can't prove this but I can't prove the best part either.
NOT FROM ME, YOU PIECE OF SHIT. THERE IS NO IMMUNITY FROM ME. You atone with me or the world you live in becomes the hell you fear in the back of your tiny mind. Every criminal I have put in prison,
Gee, thanks, Dave. Bang-up job so far. Extortion, coercion. You'll pardon me if I ask you to kiss my pucker. The same fuckers that rounded us up and sank us into this mess are telling me They'll bail me out? Fuck you. You think you can catch Keyser Soze? You think a guy like that comes this close to getting fingered and sticks his head out? If he comes up for anything, it will be to get rid of me.  After that, my guess is you'll never hear from him again.
What happened?
What call?
I don't
Because he was my friend.
He used all of you to get him on that boat. He couldn't get on alone and he had to pull the trigger himself to make sure he got his man. The one man that could identify him.
No provisions, nothing. My clients testimony for his immunity.
May-I be frank, Counselor? I suspect your political power as much as I respect it. I don't know why Mr. Kint has so many faceless allies in City Hall, and I don't care. The embarrassment he helped cause the city of New York will not happen here.
She's the only nurse who isn't testifying for the Doctors.
I want to settle this thing and be done with it.  I don't want the Archdiocese exposed.
We thought it was just.
... a Mrs. Doneghy called ... I told you that.
What does it mean?
Don't equivocate.  Be positive. Just tell the truth.
It's a common medical expression, it's a crash program to restore the heartbeat.  Dr. Marx cut an airway in her trachea, to get her oxygen, her and the baby...Ms.Nevins...
She THREW UP IN HER MASK.  Let's cut the bullshit.  Say it:  She THREW UP IN HER MASK.
That's right.
Well, we...
...to save her and to save the baby.  Is that...
Tell us.
Meth...Methodology and Technique...
Uh-huh.  Still practice a lot of medicine?
Thank you, your Honor.  Further: Ms. Costello is a rebuttal witness. As a `Surprise Witness' she may only serve to rebut direct testimony.  As her only evidentiary rebuttal was the admitting form, which has been disallowed I request that her entire testimony be disallowed and the jury advised that they must totally disregard her appearance here.
And wasn't that an oath...?  These are your initials here:  K.C. When you signed this chart you took an oath.  No less important than that which you took today.   Isn't that right?   Isn't that right...?
You didn't write that figure.  And how is it that you remember that so clearly after four years?
Easthampton Hospital for Women. Excuse me, what is that, a joke? Let me tell you something, Doctor, those men at Catherine Laboure. Men who are known not only in this city, but the world, were trying to save a woman's life.  They were there, and here you are, four years later, read some hospital report, and say...
It's a common medical term.
...apartment.   No, no. Please.  You don't know who we're dealing with, I, please believe me, they...
Cardiac arrest.  During delivery her heart stopped.  When the heart stops the brain's deprived of oxygen.  You get brain damage. That is why she's in the state she's in today.
Now, Dr. Towler's testified that they restored the heartbeat within three or four minutes.  In your opinion is his estimate correct?
No.  No thank you, Doctor.  You go home.
Yes?  Galvin, right?
Why?
I didn't do it, Mister.
My client can't walk, your Honor.
And it seems to me, a fella's trying to come back, he'd take this settlement, and get a record for himself.    I myself would take it and run like a thief.
I'm sure you would.
You should have taken their offer. Especially if you were unprepared.
Ready, your Honor.
Listen to me, fella...
Noted.  Thank you.   Miss Costello was a rebuttal witness.  Her sole rebuttal was the document,  which has been disallowed...
Mr. Alito, please.
Let me talk to Mickey.
We have a renew-your-subscription offer...
Why?
Laura.
Maybe I can do something right.
What...?
I've got to work.
That's not the question.  It's over.  Do you think that it's my fault?  If I'd...if I'd...I never should have taken it.  There was no way that I was going to win.
And what makes you so tough?
You, you don't under...
Oh, yes, I do, Joe.  Believe me. You say you're going to lose.  Is it my fault?  Listen!  The damned case doesn't start until tomorrow and already it's over for you!
It's over!
What is your wife's picture doing by the side of your...
What would you like it to be to me...?  I, I, I can't invest in failure.
I don't have a goddamned idea.
He's...you can't reach him, Sir. He's in the, on some island in the Caribbean, they don't have a phone.   He'll be back in a week...  If you'd like Dr. Halpern's number...
... hey, I don't need your charity ...
...he's a good man...
I have to try this case.  I have to do it, Mick.  I've got to stand up for that girl.  I need your help.    Mick, will you help me...?    Will you help me...?
Admittance form is wrong.
'Mary Rooney, forty-nine.  Lives in Arlington, still working at the hospital.'  Can you get out tomorrow?  How come she isn't speaking up.
I've got to go see Gruber.    What's the best cigars you have?
I think we tried that.  The case is over.
All right.  Who wasn't in the O.R.?
The 'History'...?
The Hospital...?
...you need some old forms that she had...somebody's dying...
I don't want a mistrial.
It's locked.
But what can we do?  She don't know who's visiting her ...
You know how beautiful she was?   Her husband left her, and he took her kids .... They, they, they'd let you die in there.  They don't care.  Nobody cares.  The Patriot Home, the Chronic Care ... in Arlington ...?  They'd take her in.  Perpetual care.  They'd take her.  Fifty thousand dollars they want.  An endowment.
You live in the neighborhood?
A single hour.
That's for sure, Frank.
Yes.
We had rather more important things on our mind than taking notes.   We were trying to restore her...
...we were trying to restore her heartbeat.
No, to be honest, I find it dull.
I'm afraid some harm may come to her.
Someone dead.
Yes.
But she doesn't know, about her background.  She never heard of Carlotta Valdes.
Her mother told me most of then before she died. I dug out the rest for myself, here.
It's a place to live, that's all.
No, a year ago! Where did you live a year ago!!?
No, you don't owe me anything.
Because I remind you of her?
Tomorrow m -- but I have to go to work. I've got a job.
And what will I live on? My oil wells in Texas?
Oh, Well, thank very much. But no thanks.
Yes.
Why?  Because I remind you of someone?  That's not very complimentary.  And nothing would... happen...
No.
I suppose I could phone the store in the morning, and say I'm sick.
No, there. There's a good one. Do you like that?
I'm trying to buy you a suit.
Judy, I just want you to look nice. And I know what kind of suit would look well on you.
I know. Because I remind you of her. The one that's dead. And not even that, very much.
Judy, please it can't matter to you...
It should be back from your face -- with a bun at the neck. I told them. I told you.
Oh, no. You'll muss me.
Oh! You're supposed to fasten it!
I told you. I have to go back into the past. Once more. For the last time.
Go up the stairs, Judy.  I'll follow.
Some money.
Why?
I will. You're terribly direct in your questions.
No.
I prefer John. There, that's done.  And what do you do, John?
I wanted to drive you home. Are you all right?
No, I Just thought I'd wander.
The oldest living things?
Their true name is Sequoia Sempervirens: always green, ever- living.
No.
Here with you.
Of the woman in the mirror. Would you know her if you saw her?
Yes --
Madeleine!!
And if you lose me, you'll know that I loved you and wanted to go on loving you.
Valdes. Miss Valdes.  It's Spanish, you know.
No... she only comes to sit. Two or three times a week. And I never ask questions, you know. As long as they're well behaved. I must say that I've wondered --
No three-way stretch? How very un- chic.
What are you going to do? Now that you've quit the police force?
It's where you belong.
Mmm. Why don't you go away for a while?
Oh!
Yeah, I'm a brute. We were engaged once though, weren't we?
Ah, sweet college days. But you're the one who blew it. I'm still available. Available Ferguson. Say, Midge, do you remember a guy at college named Gavin Elster?
And the idea is that the Beautiful Mad Carlotta has come back from the dead, to take possession of Elster's wife?  Ah, Johnny! Come on!
Oh?
By her own hand.  There are many such stories.
But you said grey, sir.
Now, Judy, it isn't anything to get --
Well...
Playing?
You have acquaintances - business friends and superficial golf buddies. You have always been a fringe player. You have some serious male on male intimacy problems.
What are you fucking talking about?
You're a loser.
I set up Fisher with the broker that found his house. Took care of that one, didn't I?  Prison Communications.
Listen to me. Please. Everybody just calm down a bit here. Okay... First...are we sure she's dead?
Her head's bashed in and her heart isn't beating.
Call the police. Okay, that's one option.
Yes sir, there sure is an option here. There are always options.
No we're not. The bodies are all mixed up. We can't do this to them.
Wrong. That is flat out wrong. Hell is for cowards, for hypocrites who fear to live by the strenght of their own convictions. This is war. Given the circumstances, and given the fact that we are alive and they are not, we have chosen life over death. Two wrongs don't make a right. So our conviction and execution would only mean more death here, not less.
Would you, shush?! These phones aren't secure!
Watch the tone fella.
They're on me. They're smoking me out!
What?
I know you'll be.  Three hours.
You and I have done nothing. You especially. We are innocent.
Doing the bachelor party thing?
Sweet deal.
Jack Kerouback, Herman Melville, Henry Miller and Hunter S. Thompson. I dedicate this evening to fear and to major loathing. So from sun set to sun rise, let me be heard...
Shut up.
What does that mean?
Yeah.
Hear what?
My what?
False.
Israel doesn't have a King.
What's your point?
There's my point exactly.
You will not screw this up.
How about my Fatburger?
The rings?
Why can't we do it through the mail?
Yup.
I didn't mean to Liz. I'm sorry.
I'm sorry. I'm sorry I forgot the tent. I don't think I forgot anything else.
Are we going to do this again?
I just think that at some point you're going to have to re-evaluate some of your friendships...
Who else?
You expect more what?
I've seen it on television.
Of course.
I need your help.
I will.
Well you should.
How late?
What about the chairs?
What okay?
We're not canceling.
What are you talking about?
Oh Liz. We. God. We, in Vegas. Micheal crushed her skull. She was dead. There was nothing else to do. It was an accident.
She's in the desert. She's out in the desert.
I don't know. He could have told someone. He could have, like in the event of his death, somehow let someone know where those bodies are buried.
But...
Harry Chaplin. "Cats in the Cradle."
About what?
That's my point! You see Man...burning at his absolute. To see all the forces just come together, just right, you know, just in perfect harmony. That's what I'm driving at. You get me?
What?
I have no idea.
Greenpeace?
All week long.
I'm saying it's luck. All luck. You work your entire life, all the training, focus, all the dedication, all irrelevant. Where does the ball bounce? My father spent his whole life trying to start a company, practiced every day, worked like a dog, finally got enough money. He's paid the dues, he's ready, does all the market research, picks his shot - "Pup Corn."
Pup corn?
Yup.
I kind of like "till death do us part." I mean, this is forever. In sickness and in health, through good times and bad. Honey, what do you think?
I do.
Let me go, Don Amalio, I'll tear her apart.
No. Mother Superior told me to come.
And what do you know about life? When all is said and done you couldn't possibly understand.
It's my fault. If I'd come to see you more often, if I'd invited you here for holidays, maybe everything would be different.
Maybe ...
Go away! Leave me alone.
You disgust me... even if what you say is true.
What's the matter?
Yes.
Good.
It's for wheat. We've always grown maize in the strip above the vegetables.
Why the bad temper?
I'm bored. I'm alone all day and I don't know what to do.
I'm not interested. Do what you think's best.
Leave him alone.
They worry me a great deal, and especially because of you.
Then let him go and he'll follow you.
Are you sure it isn't contagious?
They told me it isn't at the hospital.
There's been an accident.
A black bull!
This louse is looking for trouble.
Mother.
A suicide is horrible. I know. But you should have told me.
I have nothing to reproach myself for. All I know is that I've changed. With all my strength, which is not much, I will follow the road that the Lord has shown me. One can also serve outside a convent.
That's enough.  Go join the others, and don't come back here.  And you'll have to control your temper.
You fainted last night after supper. The master and I carried you here.
Hello.
No, I don't want to.
Jesus Christ.  I know who the dominant personality is.  Lindenmeyer.
You mean a nanotech synthetic organism.
Madison lives two blocks from their present location.
I wish we could hear them.
What about them?
Sid 6.7 is now armed.
You sonofabitch. How could you let them put the implant in my head? How?
If you're lying, I'll hunt you down and kill you myself.
None. He could be hiding, he could be helping Sid, or could be in little pieces on Santa Monica beach.  Any idea what Sid's going to do next?
What's the assignment?
Not if you're with him every step of the way.
I understand the risks involved here. But there is nobody better qualified to go after Sid 6.7 than Barnes. And, there is nobody who knows him better than you. If a situation becomes volatile, you will find a way to quell it. I have complete confidence in you.
No, but I've confirmed the reelection rally is the target.  How much C-4 is missing?
Barnes used to work for him when he was still a cop in the field, remember?
He hears...everything.
Do I get to see it or not?
Bastard...  Sheila, don't go anywhere. I'll be right back.
Show me his physical sensory level.
Talk so I can understand.
Then fix it.
What do you expect me to do, thank him?
If I had died yesterday, you'd have already dissected my brain and analyzed it to see if I carry any genetic predisposition toward violence.
Who said that?
Hamlet.  What's David Berkowitz got to do with Sid 6.7?
He's part of the mix. Sid 6.7 is a composite.
What we need to do is stop playing with computers and go catch the sonof-a-bitch before he kills anybody else.
In order to find him, we have to understand what makes him tick...
She's beautiful, you know?
Now that he's in the real world, there are no longer limitations on his behavior like there were in virtual reality. Sid is going to evolve.
Start of what?
You knew the entire time? Can you give me one good reason why I shouldn't kill you right now?
I pose an unacceptable danger to the public, remember?
You've already fulfilled the terms of your pardon. You stopped Sid 6.7 and you've got his module. You're free to go  right now.  Why are you going to do this?
I don't know.
Duck!
You won't want to watch. Turn around.
GRIMES, YOU'RE DEAD!
At this stage, you either get form or function. You said she wanted function. I gave you function. What are you complaining about?
Well, darlin' <u>I</u> ain't your confessor.  Tell him you've got some info on the President's sex scandal, it's on your conscience, believe me, he'll drop what he's doing.  Okay;  <u>Now</u>:  Folks, folks, folks, this is a shitty business, and it needs no Ghost Come From the Grave to tell us that.  But in Six Days, Lord willing n'Jesus Tarries, I am going to take you beauties into the second term. .....wait til you hear the speech tonight.  The 3-0-3 Speech... where's the Fad King, by the way...
Can we have a white one, please...
What'd ya think?
No, no, no...
He's <u>dead</u>.  He's <u>dead</u>.  The Fella Killed Old Shoe. 
Don't you want to know if it's true?
What difference does it make if it's true?  It's a <u>story</u>, and, it <u>breaks</u> they're gonna have to <u>run</u> with it -- How long've we got til it breaks? 
Well, yeah.  Now.  That's not good.  <u>Okay</u>:  <u>Okay</u>.  We'll set up the War Room <u>Here</u>...
All I need is the one day.
They caught him in the closet with a Girlscout.  Side- effects of a pill ain't gone trump that.  You have to keep'em guessing for  Two weeks.  You  don't have to Cure Cancer, Pal, you just have to give them something more interesting than...
Okay, look, who's takin' the press conference today?
....we landing?
Well, I'm <u>working</u> on it....
Precisely.
The thing with the Yellow Ribbon...
The hostages, but that was a naturally-occuring...  It was a put-up job?  But where was the, where was the money in that?
<u>Hello</u>... Yes.  We'll be back...?
Wilfred.  We've got <u>work</u> to do...
I <u>live</u> for midnight, when I can tear another of those suckers off.  Watcha got for me?
An <u>Albanian</u>, a young Albanian Girl.
A young Albanian Girl, dressed in their...
...Stanley Moss...
Well, keep your <u>wits</u> about you, and let's see if we can't...
...brazen-it-through...
I'm doing my job, Too.  Would you give me a... do you think you could call off your Dogs for a minute.
Could we have you in here, please...7
Where's my pill...?
...how ya feeling, boy?
The President is going to declare War against Albania in a half an hour.
Yeah, I need a list, people in Military Special Pro...
There was a group of Girlscouts here from Indiana last month.  One of them expressed an interest in a Frederick Remington bust.  The president took her into the oval Office, for a period...
I'm gonna <u>tell</u> you why...
"They Got To Know?"  <u>Stan</u>...?  Get with it.  Who Killed Kennedy...?  I read the first draft of the Warren Report, said he was killed by a Drunk <u>Driver</u>.  You watched the Gulf War.  What did you see?  Day after day, the one "Smart Bomb" falling into a building. The <u>truth</u>, I was in the building when they <u>shot</u> that shot, they shot it in a studio, Falls Church Virginia, 1/10th scale model of a building.
They got him standing by.
Yes, but there wasn't a War.
Big mistake.
Guy says he'll respect her tomorrow, he <u>might</u>, but why take a chance?  Hold out til after you're married. That's... that's.... looky, we're offering'em Schumann, make em <u>vote</u> for hhhh.... psychologically, they will understand that that's the bargain.  Make them pay for him.  Make... that's right, the price is their vote. Now, we bring him home, the President announces he is flying <u>home</u>, he's <u>here</u>, he's <u>there</u>... f'there the election, TA DA, here he is.  Have him say it like I wrote it, It'll be fine. Thanks.  Labor, five bucks an hour.  If you <u>watch</u>, <u>ten</u> bucks an hour.  If you <u>help</u> ... if you <u>help</u>, a <u>hundred</u> bucks an hour.
Ain't <u>that</u> the truth. 
Getting off on the inaugural?  Gonna go...
...the Albanian Campaign.  This... this is history...
...givem what they want...But...
I think we were experiencing a Little Technical Difficulty.
We'll deal with that when we come to it.  <u>This</u> is producing.  <u>This</u> is what they pay off on...come on, Pal, Boots and Saddles...
What he went through in <u>Albania</u>...
See y'at the Finish Line.
No, he's back in Nashville.
Well, you  said it yourself, earlier, and if I may rephrase, that the success of the President, in the Polls...
...who <u>are</u> you?  Who <u>are</u> you sonofabitches... 
Lemme talk to him.  Shoe?  Shoe...?  You in there...?
What about tipping off Yurovich?
If I ever need surgery, get me the heart of an arb like Yurovich, it's never been used...Happy Holideals Harold...
Sell it all.  What the hell, so I'll only make ten million.
Sounds like a french word, what is it?
Sounds tempting. I prefer mine with a twist of fate. You know like us meeting. Don't go away...
I'd love to, Mr. Lynch, thank you.
...not that you learned anything, Chunk.
Hey Marv, he demanded confidentiality...
Lynch is giving him the boot... He's not pulling his quota.
Didn't I tell you to knock before you came in here?
Get the hell out!
It's called pasta now Dad, spaghetti's out of date.
50 K don't get you to first base in the Big Apple, Dad, not any more. I pay 40% in taxes, I got a rent of 15,000, I got school loans, car loans, food, park my car costs me 3 bills a month, I need good suits, that's $500 a pop, shoes...
Not in here Dad... please. Later.
Goddamn fare wars are murdering us. Had to lay off five guys. Nothing I could do. What is it... money?
Don't worry about the loans. I'm doing good Dad and it's gonna stay that way now... least buy yourself a new suit.
... Dad, you should've been a CEO. How about dinner?
I'll be damned that when my men come to me tomorrow morning, wanting to know what's going on, I'm going to lie to them!
What are you doing here?
First of all, Mr. Fox, you can't just come barging in here. And what makes you think it's his birthday?
What'd you tell him?
Good. Then call him back. And call me back. Don't worry.
Lisa. Gordon? Oh, Mr. Gekko. Sure. Would you, uh, like to come in?
Didn't he tell you?  That's so like Gordon. Get dressed, we're going out.
"What are you thinking?"...that was it. The hours are hell, but the money's starting to tumble in. I know this guy who's got an iron- clad way to make money, I can't lose and I can't get hurt.
So, does "this guy" have a tip for an honest lawyer?
Relax, Roger, everybody's doing it but you don't know, you don't know.
Sure Roger, whatever you want, it's cool.
So what firm you with, pal?
Bluestar was at 21 and an eighth when I left the office. It might spin up to 25 by the bell...
What? How do you know about my father?
I don't understand.
Don't expect to get it all, sport, you'll burn out. First rule of business is never get emotional about stock, clouds the judgment. Where do we stand?
...Gordon.
I'm talking to a stockbroker who wants to run an airline. It's gonna take me two years and 2000 headaches to turn Teldar Paper around, what do I need this dink airline for? I'm up to my ass in more nuts than a fruitcake.
I can talk to these people Gordon, they trust me...and my father can be a big help in getting cuts.
Alright... Susan, get Buckingham on the box. I want him to look at it. And tell Jock Taylor at Thwick, Jensen...  So sport, the falcon has heard the falconer...tell me more...
Sure. What's worth doing is worth doing for money. It's a bad bargain where nobody gains. And if this deal goes through, we all gain.
You're walking around blind without a cane, sport. A fool and his money are lucky to get together in the first place.
The richest one percent of this country owns half the country's wealth: 5 trillion dollars. One third of that comes from hard work, two thirds of it comes from inheritance, interest on interest accumulation to widows and idiot sons and what I do -- stock and real estate speculation. It's bullshit. Ninety percent of the American people have little or no net worth. I create nothing; I own. We make the rules, Buddy, the news, war, peace, famine, upheaval; the cost of a paper clip.  We pull the rabbit out of the hat while everybody else sits around their whole life wondering how we did it...  ...you're not naive enough to think we're living in a democracy are you, Buddy? It's the free market. You're one of us now...take advantage of it. You got the killer instinct, kid, stick with me. I got things to teach you...
...few thousand dollars down the drain if you ask me.
Boy, I thought Gordon was a tough businessman, but somebody's really taking him to the cleaners here.
Where is it?
Upper West Side.
Sure... But your fee... considering you're way over budget, should be negotiable.
Fear. The fear of being poor I guess, just like you, Darien... But that's all gonna change sweetheart. I'm catching the express...  ... and you're going along for the ride.
I'm not looking to just survive. I've been doing that all my life.
What the hell's that supposed to mean?
You're not exactly pure Bud, you went after Gekko with the same vengeance you went after me. Look in the mirror before...
I figure a guy who's made some mistakes should be able to understand a girl who's made some of her own...
Any better and I'd be guilty.
Now tell me, why would I want to do that?
Oh I don't give a shit the guy's a slob.  He doesn't even know how to spell  `lady' let alone treat me like one.  You know the last time we went out he  actually made me pay for a drink?
A body.  I mean we're talking major body
Thank you
She went to a waxwork party
Can I give her a message?
Wooo.  Jealously rearing its ugly head.
That's not what you said last night.
Big deal!
Who's is all this?
China
Safety in numbers man.
Hi there Sarah
Servants.  Oh isn't it terrible darling, two more people have disappeared
Don't be facetious darling. Now drink your milk, you're late for college
You guys are being real assholes
Hey.
That's not true.
Because, I don't know, because sometimes...sometimes I forget things...and ever since Caitlin left, ever since my daughter left for school, there've been...I fainted and...  Why is this so hard?
Mm-hmm.
I saw her in the water.  Beside me.  She was filling the bathtub.
Yes, but...
You think you influenced her?
Right.  Well, I wanted to stop by to welcome you to the uh, to the neighborhood.  I'm Claire Spencer.  From next door.
This really isn't a good time.
She isn't here.
I don't know.
Oh-kay...
No.  No, I don't.
Why does everyone find that so surprising?
And so far my day has consisted of taking pictures of my roses for the garden club.
Yep.
What?
What?
No, you're not.  But a presence in your house is not something to be taken lightly.
Are we hoping the ghost is going to have to pee?
No.  Jody, listen to me.  You have to listen to me.  This is not something that I can do right now.  Whatever it was, it's gone.  I need it to be gone now.
If she was dangerous before--
She could have hurt me if she wanted to.
Did he say that?
How is it?
It's okay if you're not.
Mmm.
Not like this.  We were never like this.  I want to go over there.  After dinner, we can--
But what if something happens?
Claire...
I don't know.  Just...whispering.
Oh, no...
No.  Look!  In the window.
A flare?
Five minutes?
...Please stop...
What did you think I would do?  Jesus Christ!  I gave up my life and my music...
Who?
We don't know that for sure.
I don't know, but I am.  She was there and then she was gone.  I felt it.
What?
Little village down seven.  Supposed to be charming.
I did NOT!  I did not kill anyone.  Jesus. Claire, listen to me.  I walked in and she was lying there dead.  I swear to you.  On my life!  She took pills and she killed herself in our house to destroy me!  To destroy us!  If I hadn't stopped by here before school, the painters would have--
Who can say the hope of redemption dies with our last breath...? They must see what the legacy has wrought - Diedre, withered inside herself Carlotta, killing and stunting her own flesh and blood...  surely they sense the child you carry - and the life it might lead in Lashers grasp...   Maybe, in death, they feel remorse for the evil they embraced in life...?!
Michael, Rowan should -
I want to see my mother.
Mm-hmm.    Seems & lot longer.
I don't want it.
Hello...?  Who is this...?
Out of the question      Rowan, coming here will not change the -
There are things I have to know!
You're mad!  Your mind is sick!
Help us.  Do what you can.
Michael...  Help us...  The door!
uh - then he - be just -
There are things you will not tell him.
Nooo...  NO!  Stop!
To love, you must be able to feel.
I am only what you are --- what all of you have been.   what do you think of yourself now, my love...?
I do not understand...
I don't know what you are!!!
Always loved you. Rowan.  Always...
I guess so.  The trick is remembering how to act like one.  I'm glad you called, Mr. Curry. I wanted to see you.  Why don't we go to my office...
I'm glad you're around to say it.
No. I'm not.  Doctors should be the first ones to admit utter ignorance about some things.
Like this...?  LIKE THIS...?!
And whose houses do you design...?
Captain's orders.
You could fly down tomorrow.  I could be there the next day  I think I can last that long without you.
He can't hurt us, Michael.  It's us - our love.  He can't find a crack in it.  He can't find a way in.
I don't think of us that way - ever.
Mm-hmm...
A little sore.  Darm...   Finish up my section, will ya...?
I - I...  I can't, Michael.  There's stuff --- at the clinic -
Bullshit!  Let me in!   Mikey - there are people who can help figure this ont.
Papers...?
The one on the left - definitely...
Then it's going to be 'I killed for sex'... Listen darling, why won't you let us use your real name for the features - if people knew that it was the ELLEN CARTER writing the features and not just some pseudonym - then we might shift more units. You haven't written anything in four years darling - I know you need this job - and if circulation keeps dropping, there's not going to be a magazine for you to write for...
Don't mention it - now can I get back to my accounts, or do you want to fillet me?
Yes - it's about bank safety deposit boxes - I wonder if you might just explain how they work - and maybe even show me round.
And it can't be forged?
Oh really - you must remember me from when I was a regular customer.
Yes, two please. I'm sorry, I didn't mean to pry, it's just that I really loved your book
I don't know...
You've killed but you're not a killer
Wonderful - like a great release - He was a malignant cancer and I had to remove him - the world is better without him
Tell me about your adopted MOTHER
STEPHANIE?
Demons... This wouldn't have been possible without you... You have given me incentive ELLEN - I can see clearer now...
Nothing could be better...
I am ashamed of what I have done ELLEN. When I read what you had written it made me think - look into myself - I haven't dared look into myself for a long time - I have stopped ELLEN, I can't carry on - I won't carry on. All I want is to start a new life - I want a second chance...You are good to me - you don't condescend, you're intelligent, and very beautiful...
But for how long - what will set you off again? You'll be walking down the street and some girl will be wearing a white hat - and that will be it - back on the merry go round...
He doesn't need to...
At 2.00...
I would prefer it if you kept away from LESLIE
You heard me - keep away from him
Any time, any day, a man can completely reinvent himself.
Nobody knows about your mental retardation.
Oh. Well. Maybe not yet.
I'd feel like staying up all night! Forever! Or at least till I got the LAY of the land, SO TO SPEAK.
I love those springy head puppies!
From your lips, to God's ears.
You go first.
Ladies first.  I insist.
You like me. I like you. I guess it's pretty obvious to everyone.
Oh, Ted, DUH.  I smile at everyone since I got my braces off.
Which you pulled, hard!
Oh, Teddy Bear, you're funny.
We miss you. We miss our son.
Sometimes you have to do stuff you don't want to do. It's all part of growing up. And it usually works out peachy in the end.
Of course we are.
Like one of those "National Geographic" specials with the topless chicks?
Your mom said you've been ignoring your chores.
Want a lesson?
It's your car. These are all your cars.
Your father liked shifting. He said it brought him closer to the engine. "Like a woman, purring with ecstasy."
After graduation...maybe we could go away together?
Before we knew it, we created the most popular men's magazine in the entire nation. The rest is history.
We'll send you the release forms, Ted. Our staffers will help in any way they can.
They're not my parents, Helen. My parents are back in Xenia and I hurt them very much.
Well, Jay. They've been exceptionally supportive.
You can have it, then. I'm not going back there.
You ever look down on them again and call them "grocers" like it's a dirty word, and you'll be sucking your filet mignon through a straw for six to eight weeks. Got it?
--Do it. I triple-dog-dare you.
It's so nice to have FRIENDS like you, Christy.
Just because someone died and made you king of the publishing world doesn't mean you're even one ounce smarter than you were a week ago.
I did my homework. Your grandfather was a peach farmer.
Now it makes sense, the whole neo Bohemian, down with hypocrisy, fight the power crap. You're a poor little rich girl.
You're amazing.
I know.
But you never do.
I figured you for more of a hairy armpit guy.
Wearing them?  Or humping them?
Tell me more.
I had a Portuguese boyfriend who could read the phone book and melt me.
A Portuguese boyfriend. Sounds very "Cosmo."
You lose trust in someone and it's over, done, gone, forever.
You think you're working with chimps here?
Mom. Believe me. I could buy all that AND the factories they came from.
You promise you'll finish school?
Are you kidding? This magazine is my dream. It's every red-blooded, heterosexual male's dream.
Tipping?
Whoa. But...that's the thing...  I've never even actually...
I never finished school myself. Never had to. My brother built this empire from nothing but his wife's perky tits and a whole lot of gumption. He gave me a cushy job on a silver platter. I never struggled for a second.
I'm Ted Nelson. I guess you already know that part.  For two years I've been the editor of the high school paper in Xenia, Ohio. I've won some awards, made a difference. I've always had journalism in my soul. Now I know why.
He was in a league of his own.
I can't wait to see the pictures.
You're taking this bull of an empire by the horns, but you're still keeping your small town values. You're not letting all this "stuff" spoil you.
It's spring break. I don't want to go to a will reading.
The Van Ryan family created Blue Bay. They built the school... Sandra Van Ryan calls up the board and says kiss my ass, they say, left, right, or in the middle.  You're gonna need some help on this one, Sam.  You're gonna need a lawyer, and he'd better be a good one.
Eat a power bar.
He said something like, "Do you want it dirty7" or something.  I tried to turn away, but he pushed me to the floor.
Was there penetration?  Did he put himself inside you?
Again.  I think we covered this.  I told her I was going to call a cab.
Weren't you a little worried about her...?
There's a strip mall not half a mile from my house.  There's phones there.  I cruised the place, but I didn't see her. I figured she was probably there but that she was angry and didn't want to be found.  I don't know... Maybe I should have called.  But it's not like Kelly can't take care of herself.  I figured we'd just take it up on Monday, in the office.
Yeah, well, Van Ryan got his.  I don't imagine he gives a shit now.
Why?  You ask me, Lombardo had it pretty good already, nice job in a beautiful setting, popular, an active social life.  He's gonna put this all on the line for some dicey play like what you're describing...
The job looks okay to us.  But look at it from his point of view.  The man's surrounded by wealth and privilege.  But for him... it's just a reminder of what should have been his.
I net a guy in a bar.
Where's the body?
And if the teeth aren't Suzie's?  You'll give this up?
Yeah, maybe, a little.
She looked shaky, but lucid.  I thought, I would just go with her, stand at the door...  I think I looked away.  A split second. Then, bingo.  Just like that.  She puts a knee into my groin.  There was this coffee table between us and the wall.  She got one foot on that thing and launched herself at the gun case.  Thing had a glass door.  I could hear it breaking.  I didn't go down, but she slowed me up, just enough.  Before I could get to her, she'd turned on me with this small caliber handgun.  I yelled at her to put it down.  She got off a shot.  I took it in the shoulder.  I... I had no choice. I returned fire.  Two rounds, I think. In the chest.
I wanna go home now.
Ms. Toller.  I'm asking you now, under oath, did Samuel Lonbardo rape you?
Yeah, sometimes.  Lots of the kids hang out here.  You really think something bad happened to Suzie?
No.  But I mean... just the idea that Mr. Lombardo would...
Nothing.
I think we just need to get wasted.
Jeez, that thing... Can't you...
Look, Kelly... I'm sorry... I know what you've been through... I should've seen something like this coning.
I don't know... I think it was something else... Suzie says the bust was bullshit...
Not in here.  Chiropractor comes in here for lunch sometimes.
Detective Duquette, Ms. Van Ryan.  Let me in.  Now.
I did.  At Blue Balls.
That's cop bullshit.
Are you mad at me?
But then it is better this way, don't you think?  No loose ends.
Sorry, Sandy.  I've got plans.
Swamp's where it's at, Sandy.  Gives you a look into the muck we all crawled out of.  You ought to try it some time.
Didn't you see her this morning?
So maybe I'm a one-woman man.
Then why kidnap them?  Why not just kill them?
Try what?
Aha?
Limestone quarry, Southern mansion. Easy to get them mixed up... I say we invite ourselves to the party.
All what?
I'm going to hit you.
That's right... That's good.
"Spontaneous."  I like that.  Most people say something like "hare- brained reckless son-of-a-bitch."
Oh, no, we split him fifty-fifty.
We've got to stop him right here, now!  With that armored steam engine of his it'll be a slaughter.
There's only seventy-eight.
Thank you.
That's... that's the criminal mind about to stomp our sorry butts!
We'll see.
Here.  Mr. Tyler.  He claims a certain skill at handling firearms.
Forgive me, but you don't strike me as the social secretary type.
I suppose so.  But life can be hard for a man, too.
Oh, I would hope not.
Really?  Like General Garrison or didn't you hear all that shooting?
I would, Mr. Doyle!  Are you game?
Well, yes sir.  A Professor Morton, but with just a little more time, sir, I can assure you a breakthrough on this case...
French?  Damn it, I want my own man on this case.  Somebody I trust. Somebody who doesn't mind breaking up the furniture!
Thank you.  I confess to a preoccupation with acquiring precisely that which the world says I cannot have.
Call it what you like.  The point is, I was heir to that land, Mr. West.  It belonged to my beloved grandmother!  Now I intend to have it back.  My own country!
Who were they?  What do they want with me?
Gimme a sword, Airk.  I'll win your war for you.
Is this what's left of your army?
I love you.
You be careful.  I'm a powerful sorcerer.  I could turn you into a toad just like that.
Peck!  Quick!  Douse the fire!
I will.
Nursemaid?!
Elora Danan!
You?
We need your help.  To take this baby to Tir Asleen.  She's a prin- cess.
No!
No.
I must concetrate my imagination...to creat a new...reality!
What's the magician's weapon?
More!  More!
No!  You let us handle this.  Come along, Rool!
Queen Bavmorda transformed her.
Milking?
I've seen pictures.
Not used to hard work. That's what makes an appetite.
Upstairs, asleep. Where'd you think?
That's none of your goddamn business! So keep your goddamn holier-than- thou mouth shut!  Anyway, they like Fred.
Oh sure, Fred.
John, why?...
It's been a while.
Pick up the hat.
Have you got your gun on now?
Zenovitch was about to deliver a list of names tonight  street chemists... the guys processing this P2P into speed.
When word gets out that Zenovitch was a cop, all hell will break lose. You've got 24 hours. That's all I can give you. 24 hours on your own. After that the case and the witness go back to the Homicide Department.
If I did, I'd have kept my mouth shut...  It fits, Paul... Fifty-five gallons of P2P confiscated four years ago... Guess who was in on the collar? Mac.  He salts it away somewhere... he knows the stuff is potent, but the street chemists haven't figured out how to process it. But they do now.  And now the stuff is worth five-grand a pint and there are a lot of pints in a fifty-five gallon drum.
Johnny 
Listen to me, Johnny. Come in! You're out there all alone... We're getting close... real close... Maybe if you listen to me for a minute we can work something out so you can come in 
There'll be another train.  The man who was killed tonight was a policeman, Sam. It's my job to find out who did it. I want you to tell me everything you saw when you went in there.
It's not a joke.
No you're not   You're glad, because now you've got a witness.  I heard the other police talking last night.  They don't seem to like you very much.
I can't.
How long have I been here?
You tell him. When you're able.
Anything against zippers?
No.  I was being unrealistic. Even thinking about living this life.
You'd lie to protect him.
I admit I don't know where he is.
He accused John of taking kickbacks. And you know  anybody who knows John  knows that's a goddamn lie!
But... if you had to guess?
No? Why not?
You just wouldn't. It's not the Amish way.  But I think it would have done me good if I could have screamed at your brother last night.
We'll pray that he doesn't die! But if he does, then we'll find a way so no one knows!
Rachel, this is a man's life, we hold it in our hands.
Eh? Well then, maybe he can go to Zook's barn-raising, eh? See how good a carpenter.
No sin? Maybe. Not yet. But, Rachel, it does not look...  Don't you know there has been talk? Talk about you, not him. Talk about going to the Bishop. About having you... shunned!
He's from... Ohio... My cousin.
Dorothy, please!  We're trying to count! Fifty-eight--
No, Aunt Em -- this was a real, truly live place.  And I remember that some of it wasn't very nice....
Well, Dorothy was walking along the --
Oh ....
You are?
Ohhh!
This?
Oh!
Hickory!
Whenever you wish.
Professor Marvel never guesses -- he knows! Now, why are you running away?
Why --
Ohh -- what's that? Oh --
Oh - I'll get it!
Oh! Oh!
Look -- it ticks!
You're right -- I am a coward.
The nerve.
Why, I'd thrash him from top to bottomamus!
But why?  Why?
Lion, darling -- I knew you'd come!
I think I'll miss you most of all.
Well, why don't you use them?  When you come home, don't go by Miss Gulch's place.  Then Toto won't get in her garden, and you won't get in no trouble.  See?
Oh, well, here -- let me help you.
Help! I'm burning!  I'm burning!  I'm burning!  Help! Help! Help!
Dorothy next!
It did?
I don't know.
What was that?
Now...
Do -- do you think it'll be polite -- dropping in like this?
Dorothy! You can't sleep here! You can't sleep in the middle of a field!
Whozat?
Wait a minute. This is the left one. He walks bad enough already.
Don't push!
Here, Tin Man -- help me.
Oh!  Well, what happened to you?
But how can we find her? We don't even know where she is. Look! There's....
Don't cry now.  We haven't got the oil-can with us and you've been squeaking enough as it is.
Yes -- how about Dorothy?
Help!
Made to look just like an accident.
Elektra would control it all.
I need you to pass me fit now, Molly.
Renard.
How many deaths is he responsible for? How many innocent people? You may only get one shot at a man like Renard. Same circumstances, Id do the same again.
The worm on the hook again.
Then Robert was right about a Russian connection.
Have you forgotten who saved your life in Geneva?
God no. All those horrible loved ones and relatives. I dont want to talk to those people. I just want to...talk to my father.  I loved him.  Im not sure he knew that.
If youve come here to look after me, Mr. Bond, thank you, but no thank you.  I have two bodyguards, I dont need a third...
You dont take no for an answer, do you?
I think youre one of the bravest people Ive ever met.
...you should rest.
I have to go to work.
You can drop the act, its over.
You do what you have to do, but Ive called in M.  Shes en route from London even now.
Soon shell be everywhere.
Five more turns and your neck will break.
But you would have something to gain by killing Robert King. And stopping his pipeline.
She dropped a million and half dollars to the House -- your House. And you didnt even bat an eyelid.  She was paying you off.  What for?
No!  Get me out!
Is it?
There's no right or wrong.  But if you don't give me an honest response, I can't help you.  I want to help you.  I want to know all about you.
Saw the world that night -- random, empty, hideous.  God didn't make it that way.  We did.  We make the world -- in our own image.  What else can I illuminate?
. . . And just how would you manage that?
In the immediate future we're on Mars.  I'm telling you goodbye. You're trying to convince me to cure your illness . . .
Jesus, Jon, I nearly choked to -- where are we --
I didn't give you cancer, Laurie.  Not you, not the others.  I don't know what did.
I don't know yet.  I should be able to tell you in -- roughly six hundred years.
I see what the watchmaker made.  I see the universe!
It's -- he's got some kind of conspiracy theory.  He thinks someone's . . . I don't know, stalking us.
The missing scientists.
What is it?  How does it work?
Dan, what are you so scared of?  I mean, me, I've spent all these years keeping Jon together, and now that it's over I feel -- I feel glad.  I'm finally free to, to go out and live my own life, and --
Are you kidding?  If they put him in jail he's dead.  He'll never get to trial.
One more down.  Someone tried to kill Adrian.  . . . First time I've ever heard him scared.
I know what you're thinking.  You'd be a lot safer if I weren't around.
Oh, Laurie.  Jesus.  No.
No offense, Laurie, but it was Silk Spectre I had the crush on.  Tonight was the first time I've felt like myself in ten years.
I think he's going to the john.
What caused it?
Jon Osterman, you don't act like a Princeton boy.  What's a big lug like you doing in a place like this?
I don't know their real names.
I don't know their real names!
And how's life with the walking H-bomb?
What is this place?
Sure as gravity. I've had a feeling about you from the start, Cage. It's nausea.
You know what I hate? Any scumbag with a clean shirt and a bad haircut can get one of those tin stars and suddenly they think they're God.
That's too bad. I thought a guy like you would appreciate the challenge.
Wherever you go on the planet, I'll find you. There's no quitting. If you try to take it off, a ring of needles will inject enough curare into your bloodstream to kill you before you hit the ground. Is all that clear?
Fine, but I'm not gonna be no Bulldog Omega 5.
Jesus Christ, Gibbons, this is something we came up with?
I'm pretty happy to see me too. So are you done with me yet?
You're a jerk-off, you know that?
That's some accident, hombre. You accidentally fall out of a plane in the middle of the night and land up in my back yard.
Slick graphics, huh? See these dudes? They're called "Anarchy 99", they're the bad guy bosses.
You wanna check it out? Come here.
Mind your business.
That makes two of us then, sweetheart, because I ain't buying your bullshit either. You're not like them, I can see it in your eyes. So you tell me, who's bullshitting who?
The people I know want facts, the kinds of things an insider would know. They're interested in putting Anarchy 99 out of business.
What the hell are you doing? You could've killed me!
I know which cops are good and which are bad. Come with me. Come on, right now.
Aren't you afraid?
Yes, I do. You're right. I can't just let him go free. Besides, I can help you from the inside.
Aren't they gonna wonder were you've been?
If they launch it, I know how to bring it back.
Let's do this.
A piece of shrapnel hit me.
It has to surface to release the nerve agent, right?
By then it's too late! The only way to safely dispose of the nerve agent is in deep water! The chemicals will break down and dissipate!
It's about your next mission. You need to be debriefed.
You run around with maniacs jumping motorcycles in the desert, you break 36 bones crashing wave runners and snowboarding off cliffs, all with no health insurance... It's insane, I can't take it anymore.
I don't wanna go mersh, you know that. But hey, if this is about money...
Alright, so I'll get more.
Of course I'm serious. I bought it, didn't I?
Here we go again.
The corner. Anarchy 99.
He's not with us, Xander. He must be with you.
It's all this craziness! It's what we've been living since 99, when we left the Army. One of our brothers died in Grozny and we said the hell with this shit. What for? He dies for what? Politics? Who's politics? Not ours.
You, an Army brat? I don't see that one at all. Did you join the service as well?
Sure, if that's what you want. Why not? It's all human nature. So we just have to launch our baby and wait for the decline and fall of civilization as we know it.
And here I thought "anarchy" was just something cool to put on a Tshirt.
The neuro-filter acts like a surge protector, regulating the infinite flow of information from Cerebro to the Professor's mind.  It's what keeps him from being crushed by the consciousness of millions.
I'm afraid without Cerebro's help, he won't have the strength to heal himself -- And without the neuro- filter... there's no Cerebro.
So where do you think he's planning this larger demonstration?
I don't like him being here.
Sure you are, sport.
Some cigars.  Case of beer.
What if I like the pain?
Suit yourself.
I can assure you, there is no such creature in my genes.
You mutant bastards...
INTENTION?  Intention, Senator?  We are talking about mankind here.  His fear.  It is only a matter of time before mutants will be herded into camps.  Studied for weaknesses.  And eventually wiped off the face of the Earth.
I brought you here so that you would be safe from Magneto.
Who?
Deal.
To find Rogue.
I'll go.
You definition of definitive was always a bit extreme for me, Max. What is it like these days?
I'm going to change the world with or without you as a witness, Charles.  And this one gets a front row seat.
I feel a great swell of pity for the poor soul who comes to that school again looking for trouble.
Now wait a minute!
What?
MMmmm.
I promise.
Mother's going to help me with the invitations.
Yes.  I am a bit tired, after all.
Yes, but... I thought, perhaps tonight, under the circumstances, I might... stay here with you.
That's a tough choice.
May I have it, please?
I don't know what you mean, sir.
The old violinist -- you smashed his violin over your knee.
Well, thank you very much for all your trouble.
Saturday night, yes, sir.  Have a pleasant journey!
Are you putting me on?
Fro-derick!
I got frightened all alone upstairs, so I came down here.
Could be worse!
Could be raining!
All right... elevate me!
Tonight?
What?
I'm sorry.  I don't mean to take out my frustration on you.  You've been a great help to me, and I've let you down.
Give -- me -- your -- hand!
Act casual!
What d'ya mean "What monster?' You remember...the one we madein the basement.
MMMmmmm!  MMMmmmm!
Don't you think I know that?  But what are you judging by?  Bucharest??? This was always a hick town.  They can't get a 'Bus and Truck' company to come in here.  Are you going to let these idiots get the best of you? ...Or are you going to stand up like a man and show them that you've got more dignity in your little finger than they've got in all their beer- bloated bodies put together?
Listen!  Don't you hear that strange music?
But who was playing it?
I thought it was wonderful.
Stop -- singing!!!
Are you serious??
Give him the sedative!
I think so.
And I have mine.
MMmmm.
MMMMmmmmm!
The doctor said to allow seven minutes:  no more and no less -- or else they could both become hopelessly paralyzed.
Igor -- the clock!  Hurry!
Franz!  Help!  Lunatic!
Intelligence? Sources of your own? Did it not occur to you they may be native rumours? Rumours to draw you off- to leave the whole ofNatal open to a possible counter thrust
I'm explaining my reasons.
A large party of Zulus have been sighted in the direction of the King's KraaL Getting up, CHELMSFORD moves over to look at the map on his desk.
Well, my horses are feeding, as you may observe, Mr Coghill. It'll take a little while.
