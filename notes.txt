- How do encoders/decoders work as it pertains to text classification and deep learning?
	- An encoder takes a string as input and converts it into a numerical vector.
	- A decoder takes an encoded string and decodes it from a numerical vector to its original word.
		- EX: For the sentence "the dog is hungry," "dog" ----> [0, 1, 0, 0]
- What is "buffer size" as it pertains to NLP and deep learning? 
- What is "one-hot encoding?"
	- One-hot encoding is a method of turning a token into a word vector, or transforming
	  categorical features into numerical ones. 
	- It consists of associating a unique integer index with every word 
	  and then turning that i into a binary vector of size N (the length of your vocabulary).
	- For example:
		If your vocabulary is size N = 5 and you wanted to one-hot encode the word "cat", 
		a one-hot encoded version of "cat" would look something like:
			[1, 0, 0, 0, 0] 
- What is an LTSM layer?
- What is character-based RNN?
- The two fundamental deep learning algorithms for text and sequence processing
  are recurrent neural networks (RNNs) and 1D convnets.
- What is back propagation?
	- machine learning algorithm that updates weights every iteration.
- What does it mean to "embed" words?
- What is "teacher forcing?"
- What is a "look-ahead mask?"
- What is a lambda layer?
- The basic Tensorflow workflow is as follows:
	1. Examine and Understand the Data
	2. Build Input Pipeline
	3. Buld Model
	4. Train Model
	5. Test Model 
	6. Improve the Model and Repeat
- What is a hash function?
- What do ellipses (...) mean?
	- Used to slice multi-dimensional arrays
	- For example, [..., 0] is the same as [:, :, 0] or [:, 0]
- What is the difference between interfaces and abstract classes in Java?
	- Unlike an interface, an abstract class can have concrete methods (i.e. you can put shit in the body)
- What are pointers?
	- A pointer is a variable that holds the memory address of where a value is. 
- When would you use abstract/interface in Java?
	- An interface is a collection of method declarations with n	  no bodies. 
	- Interfaces are how Java achieves abstraction, a programming paradigm that specifies WHAT a class does but not how. 
	 - It allows for multiple class inheritance.
- A stack is memory reserved to maintain method invocations.
	- The first method in the stack is the main() method. 
- What are generics in Java?
- How does binary search work?
	- Given a sorted array:
		1. You split the array into two halves.
		2. Look at each index in the first half:
			if element found ---> return index;
			if element not in first half:
				- search second half
			else
				return -1
- How would you reverse a stack array?
- What is gradient boosting?
- Fiture out how to do a simple logistic regression in Python.
- What is an ROC curve?
- What does the iter() function in Python do?
- Why is one-hot encoding an inefficient technique compared to embedding?
- What is a protected member in Java?
- What are timesteps in a Sequence model?
- What is latency in computer science?
- Concurrency is when multiple computations are happening at the same time. 
- What's a kernel?
- What is a reference?
- Gradient boosting is a machine learning technique for regression and classification problems, 
  which produces a prediction model in the form of an ensemble of weak prediction models, 
  typically decision trees.
